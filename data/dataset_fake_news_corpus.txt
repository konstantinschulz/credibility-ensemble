Meanwhile, other players also complained of receiving redundant loot items upon redeeming their Faction Engrams.\n\nThe game developer has since recognized these feedback from fans and explained that they had applied a new mechanism of distributing new weapons in the Faction Rallies for Season 2.\n\n\"It was not made clear beforehand that the new Season 2 weapons would be added throughout the events of the Season rather than all at once in the beginning. This was on us. No excuses,\" Bungie explained in a community forum.\n\nIn a separate statement explaining the distribution of new weapons in upcoming Faction Rallies, Bungie confirmed that each Faction would receive five new weapons which, as mentioned, would be handed out all throughout the event.\n\nBungie explained that the weapon rewards, called Winner's Offering, will be changed to a new type as a new Faction Rally event takes place.\n\nThe Auto Rifle Winner's Offering for the first rally has already been made available. As for the second rally, the same rule applies and Bungie added: \"Additionally, the previous Winner's offering (Auto Rifles) and an additional weapon are added to Faction Engram rewards.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the game developer promised that the third and final Faction Rally in season 2 will also call for a new weapon \"that has yet to be featured.\"\n\n\"The previous Winner's Offering will be added to the Faction Engram rewards, alongside an additional weapon. This brings the total to four weapons within the Faction Engram, and a final Winner's Offering for factions to compete for over the course of the event,\" Bungie further explained.\n\nRecently, Bungie was also criticized by \"Destiny 2\" players after they imposed a restriction in the number of chest rewards that can be claimed. The developer has since explained that this had been done to address an exploit that allowed players to harvest loots in the Lost Sector at a rate much faster than Bungie preferred.\n\nHowever, Bungie agreed with players that the remedy they had applied \"is way too penalizing\" and promised to fix it in an upcoming patch.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/destiny-2-news-bungie-responds-to-complaints-on-faction-rallys-redundant-rewards-214630/"}

We are a trade union that was born from the metal working industry but we have since 2013 expanded our scope, we now represent workers along the value chain of metal working. Its moved from the automotive industry to transportation to mining, and we are now even organizing the energy sector. So for example the power utility ESKOM has NUMSA members, NERSA -- National Energy Regulator of South Africa -- has NUMSA members. But the bottom line is that the workers we represent mostly are in the metal industry, the automotive industry, and along that value chain.\n\nWhat is NUMSA\u2019s position towards the current government and political context in South Africa?\n\nI\u2019ll answer your question first and then I\u2019ll give some context. Our view of the current South African government is we have taken a very oppositionist perspective, we are opposed to the ANC -- African National Congress, ruling party in South Africa -- -led government. Up until 2013 NUMSA was an active member and an alliance partner and supporter of the ANC. This was because in the days of the liberation movement when we were still fighting the apartheid regime, all of the various formations, the trade unions, the NGOs and the popular community struggles which were all fighting against apartheid all came together in an alliance. So if you were an ANC member you were automatically a supporter of all of the trade union federations, of COSATU --Congress of South African Trade Unions -- for example. You were automatically a supporter of the UDF -- United Democratic Front. So that was the history, that was the alliance which was formed during the times of apartheid which was made up of the ANC, COSATU, SACP -- South African Communist Party -- and other organizations were all part of one umbrella organization supporting each other in alliance.\n\n\u201cFrom the early 90s, we began to vociferously oppose the fact that the ANC had made a decision to promote neoliberal capital in its macroeconomic policies.\u201d\n\nEven in 1994 when South Africa transitioned from apartheid to a democratic or a so-called democratic state, that alliance continued. The ANC government was in power but it was in power because of this alliance that it had and because of this relationship it had with the South African Communist Party and other trade unions. NUMSA was part of COSATU at that time, and of course we were then automatically part of the alliance, and we did endorse the ANC government.\n\nHowever, we were opposed even though we were supporting them; politically we did not necessarily agree with the economic strategy that they were pursuing. From the early 90s, we began to vociferously oppose the fact that the ANC had made a decision to promote neoliberal capital in its macroeconomic policies. We had within the alliance expressed an extreme opposition because we felt that these economic policies in the long term would have a hugely detrimental impact on the working class in South Africa because they ultimately increased poverty and they would not attend to the problem of inequality which we inherited as a result of the apartheid system.\n\nApartheid in South Africa in many ways remains even today. We say that because even though it is illegal for anybody to be racist towards you, in practice our economy is racist. Our economy still is structured in terms of the way it was during the days of apartheid, very little has changed. After the black government took over, even now 23 years later, the means of production, the ownership structure of most corporations, especially multinationals and big companies, they are all dominated by white capitalists and white capitalist companies. You have a situation where the richest people in South Africa continue to be white people, just like it was under apartheid, white people continue to live the best lives just like they did under apartheid. That\u2019s when you realize that the battle has to be much more than just about race. If you are not dealing with the fundamentals and the fundamental structure of the economy then you\u2019re never going to change that kind of racial imbalance that we have inherited from the apartheid and colonial systems that we had in this country.\n\n\u201cOur economy still is structured in terms of the way it was during the days of apartheid, very little has changed.\u201d\n\nOur government did not fundamentally transform, so they did not demand land, they did not nationalize the land, they did not nationalize the minerals, they did not offer free and compulsory education and health care and all of those things. They have pretty much followed and adhered to the demands of the World Bank and ratings agencies in terms of how our economy is structured. It\u2019s allowed the dominance of white capital to continue as if apartheid did not end. Even in that time we have had, for example, the implementation of labor brokering, which has had a really negative impact on workers in South Africa, especially our members, many are finding themselves in precarious work, because of what labor brokering does. Our government now is tolling the freeways, in a system called E-tolls that commercializes the use of the roads.\n\nIt was those decisions, and ultimately Marikana, the massacre of the mine workers in August of 2012 was actually the catalyst for the decision that NUMSA made in the following year in 2013 to break away from the alliance because it then became patently clear that the government was actually an enemy.\n\nIt was not a government of the working class, it was not a government that was interested in social justice for the majority of the working class; it was a government which had in essence become a security guard if I can say to protect white corporate and white capitalist interests. I think it\u2019s very important, I have to say that when we talk about the racism and that aspect, we are sometimes accused of being racist but we are not being racist, we are just articulating the reality. In a country where the majority of the people are African, it just doesn\u2019t make sense that the economy should be controlled by such a small percentage of people. That is ultimately what we are fighting against. Thats why in 2013, in the Special National Congress of NUMSA their members made the decision that they would no longer support the ANC government in the alliance, they would no longer support President Jacob Zuma as president of the country especially because of the extreme levels of corruption that were emerging, and him spending millions on his own personal home, and we were now going to pursue an agenda for the working class and we were going to pursue the idea of the formation of a worker\u2019s party, whose interests champion the interests of the working class.\n\n\u201cMany members of the ANC are actually communists, however, in practice their policies are hurtful to the working class and the poor.\u201d\n\nWhen NUMSA made that decision, we were then expelled from COSATU, and when you are expelled from COSATU, there are a whole load of other things that happened as a result of that. So our view of the current political dispensation is that whilst they may sound like they care about the working class, and you will hear they use the right kind of language, because they do have that liberation history, and they do have a long association of working with working class formations, many members of the ANC are actually communists, or members of the South African Communist Party. However, in practice if you look at the economic policies that have been implemented, those policies are hurtful to the working class and the poor.\n\nAs we speak right now the ANC government is proposing legislation to undermine all of the hard work and the rights that we have fought for as workers in South Africa. During apartheid, African workers had no right to organize, they were not allowed to join a union, it was illegal to unionize, and you could be severely punished for being involved in those types of activities. Now what we are finding is that they are trying to change the legislation, but its a type of oppression that is very clever. They are not oppressing you with the gun, what they have said is that from next year May, if you want to go on strike, in the middle of your strike if your strike is a very long and lengthy strike, the state has the right to approach the labor court, and stop your strike, if its having \u201can extremely negative impact on the economy\u201d.\n\nThey have also proposed that we as trade unionists must ballot, and hold elections among ourselves where we allow our members to vote and say whether they want to have a strike or not. Usually in trade union culture when members want to go on strike its very simple. You have a mass meeting, workers en mass will agree with a show of hands, \u201cYes we all agree, we want to go on strike\u201d or \u201cNo that\u2019s it, we are done, its over,\u201d but its a very sort of informal process but it is done very organically and its done in that style. Now they want us to have an election, where we must cast votes in a secret way to say yes we want to continue with the strike or no we don\u2019t continue with the strike. By implementing a system like that you are actually in effect subverting the right to strike. The right to strike is now no longer an automatic right, it is now being hampered by bureaucracy. So they are using bureaucracy as a way to limit our right to strike.\n\n\u201cThe right to strike is now no longer an automatic right, it is now being hampered by bureaucracy.\u201d\n\nHow they have justified this is by Marikana. They blame the Marikana massacre on the workers, they believe that the violence that took place at that time was because the workers were violent. The workers were violent, therefore the police had to come out and shoot 34 unarmed striking workers. After Marikana, there was a platinum strike of over 6 weeks, it was one of the longest strikes ever recorded in post-apartheid South Africa. It almost destroyed the platinum industry in South Africa because workers were inspired by what they had seen in Marikana and they were also horrified by the mass murder, so they refused to back down on the demand for 12,000 rand. The demand for that wage of 12,000 rand was the catalyst and what sparked the Marikana strike. So you found that all of these miners in and around the platinum belt all started demanding the same thing, which caused a massive strike that lasted a long time, which the state couldn\u2019t break.\n\nIts for that reason that they have now come up with these laws, which they designed to try and limit our rights so that they can actually intervene and stop the strike when they feel like we are having too much of an impact. At NUMSA that means we are even more an enemy of the state than we were before, because as far as we are concerned this bill is an infringement on our fundamental and basic right to strike. The bill at the moment is still a bill and there are public consultations taking place so as NUMSA we have participated in the consultation, where we have rejected it, but we are also planning to take the issue to the Constitutional Court. We believe that it is a constitutional violation, that what our government is trying to achieve is actually going to remove our most basic rights, a right we did not have during apartheid and now it seems in this post-apartheid government, that right is going to be taken away by the very same \u201cprogressive\u201d black government, because they are only interested in protecting the interests of capital and big business.\n\nWhat is NUMSA\u2019s perspective on how they see Pan African unity happening on the continent?\n\nFor us, solidarity -- whether it\u2019s Pan African or international -- is critical. We were part of the liberation movement in the days of apartheid and it was international solidarity that played a major role in destroying the apartheid government. As Marxists and as Leninists we believe in international solidarity and we believe that we have a role to play on the continent.\n\nThat is why we have been actively supporting our Zambian comrades with the struggles that they are facing against the Lungu regime, particularly because as South Africans we were hosted by the Zambian government under apartheid and now that we see them, when we see them suffering we feel that it is our responsibility to highlight the crisis. In fact we were the first in South Africa to raise the alarm about what was going on in Zambia, because the Zambian government and the South African government are very cozy, they are very good friends. The mainstream media in South Africa is asleep when it comes to these issues. They are not very connected to what is going on in the continent, they are very focused on what is goes on in South Africa, they are very insular. When ordinary Zambians started complaining about rights abuses, a lot of people weren\u2019t even hearing them and it was only really when NUMSA started to make a lot of noise on behalf of Zambian people that South Africans started to be aware of the oppression that was taking place through the Lungu government.\n\n\u201cAs Marxists and as Leninists we believe in international solidarity and we believe that we have a role to play on the continent.\u201d\n\nWe are also creating relationships with other African countries and we are doing that through the Pan African Today. Earlier in the year we hosted the Pan African Socialist Conference in Tunisia, and even my presence here in Brazil as a representative of NUMSA is part of that process. We believe that it is very important that we must build these relationships because we can see the attack against the working class, ultimately we are all fighting the same battles. We are fighting former liberation governments who because of the fact that they believe that they freed us from colonialism they can do as they please. Anywhere on the continent you have your Mugabes of Zimbabwe for example, Mugabe felt he had the right to be a dictator for 30 years because he \u201cliberated\u201d the people of Zimbabwe from colonialists, and we are all suffering from that. When you look at what happens in that transition, what kind of government takes place after that so called liberation takes place, its oppression through a different form, its oppression through capitalism and pursuing a neoliberal agenda.\n\nIn South Africa, that oppression has resulted in an unemployment rate of 35% and growing, where poverty levels are at 55% and growing, 55% of the entire population is living below the poverty line. Where three white men own the entire wealth of the South African economy, so we realized that it is not enough for you to fight a battle against racism, ultimately the demon here is not racism, it\u2019s a system, a capitalist system which perpetuates inequality. So that\u2019s why its very important for us to speak about solidarity and creating a media platform where we can have and express our ideology as members of the working class because we know that it is the socialist ideology which is truly the solution to the world\u2019s ills. We are hoping that the rest of the continent can also come to this realization, and this is the message that we are trying to spread all over the continent and all over the world as well.\n\nThis article previously appeared in The Dawn News", "domain": "blackagendareport.com", "label": 0, "url": "https://blackagendareport.com/numsa-south-african-union-confronts-new-forms-apartheid-through-class-struggle"}

And it's also important that we summon the right energy into this space no matter what faith you are. We have to understand what the struggle is about.\"\n\nShe continued: \"Making sure that jails don't expand is a first step. We don't want cages at all. Our people don't belong in cages at all. And we understand that there is a direct relationship, our ancestors demand that we engage in this work because as an African person in this country we know we were brought over here as chattel and once they banned the slave plantations, many of those plantations were warped into prisons so they continue to enslave us. So this is ancestral and spiritual work that we must do. So we are going to pour libation in the names of our ancestors, in the names of those who struggle right now.\"\n\nShe then proceeded to pour what appeared to be bottled water as she summoned the energy of the dead while declaring \"ashe.\"\n\n\"We summon those spirits that are still with us. We summon those people whose bodies have been stolen, but whose souls are still here,\" she said. \"We call on Wakiesha Wilson. We call on George Jackson ... Eric Garner ...\"\n\n\"And all of those whose bodies have been stolen: We ask that you be with us. We ask that you work through us. We ask that we do righteous work on your behalf,\" Abdullah continued inside the church.\n\n\"We call on Martin Luther King into this space. Brother Malcom [X], we call you into this space. Ashe. ... Nat Turner, into this space. Ashe. Mother Harriet Tubman. Ashe. We call you all into this space. We ask that you work through us. That you give us power; that the Creator give us power when we come together. This victory is assured. Ashe. Ashe. Ashe,\" she ended.\n\nThe practice of libation is a common practice in some African-American churches like Unity Fellowship Church of Baltimore where they conduct the ritual to \"honor the ancestors. Those who in one way or another helped us to get to where we are today.\"\n\nAccording to Dr. Ayuk, however, while libation can be found in the Bible it was \"done as a form of worship to God and not gods.\"\n\nHeathens, he said, \"copied the practice and when Israel strayed from God, they took the ritual to heathen gods\" and most African communities currently pour libation as a part of their tradition.\n\n\"The practice is said to have begun in Israel when Jacob intended to appease God with a drink offering and oil (Gen 35:14). Although from Genesis 1-35 there is a mirror that captured the culture of the surrounding nations, there is no indication any of them performed the ritual before this time,\" Ayuk wrote.\n\n\"Drifting away from God has nefarious consequences. Perhaps that is why most African countries entrenched in ancestral worship are backwards because they seem to invite more the wrath rather than the favor of God. From Africa to Asia, Latin America to Europe and North America to Central America, there is enough evidence that abandoning the ways of God will fetch us disaster now and hell fire in the world to come,\" Ayuk added.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/professor-conducts-libation-to-summon-spirits-of-blacks-killed-by-police-in-hollywood-church-214285/"}

Thus far, the movie has raised just under $44,000 out of its stated goal of $2 million.\n\n\"That is another violation of religious freedom.

But it was not in my interest,\" Parsan said. \"I was so angry, I was so unhappy. But she came back the next day with a small Bible, so this time I asked Jesus to help me.\"\n\nShe started reading the Bible, which she had to keep secret from her husband, and grew in the faith. But her family life only got worse and she attempted to take her own life by overdosing on sleeping pills after her husband physically attacked her.\n\nShe survived the assault and that was when she woke up in a hospital and realized she was being called for greater things.\n\n\"I was too scared to go home and the police came to the hospital to talk to me. Many people were helping me find a safe place to live, and I knew it was Jesus,\" Parsan recalled.\n\n\"And soon, the police called to tell me that they had uncovered a plot in which my abusive husband had planned to kidnap the children back to Iran. After that, we moved to Sweden, and the policeman told me that I have an angel on my shoulder.\"\n\nTwo years after moving to Sweden she was baptized in the Christian faith. In 2006, she survived a car accident, which is when she said she realized God spared her life so that she could help Muslims come to Christ.\n\nIn 2012, Parson became a minister in the Church of Sweden, focusing much of her work on reaching out to the Muslim community and inviting them to explore the faith.\n\nShe has helped as many as 1,500 come to Christ in the past five years, she estimates, despite risks to her life.\n\n\"I have serious threats at least a couple of times per year, a threat of a knife attack or a bomb attack. I have a police officer attached to my case I can always call, and we have security during our services. I have other threats from my own distant family members,\" she revealed. \"But for me, what I do is worth it.\"\n\nChristians back in Iran meanwhile continue suffering intense persecution for their faith, believers have said, despite the claims of a prominent bishop who attempted to argue that they \"enjoy complete freedom.\"\n\nBishop Sibo Sarkisian, the Armenian-Orthodox Bishop of Tehran, said last month that Iran grants Christian citizens \"every right to practice their faith, including observing their feasts such as Christmas,\" and said that the only thing they are prohibited from doing is sharing their faith publicly.\n\nMohabat News, which says it is the news agency of Iranian Christians, pointed out, however, that for millions of believers, including the growing numbers in Iran, evangelism is a biblical mandate, and is an essential part of the faith.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/iranian-christian-convert-leads-1500-muslims-christ-sweden-214267/"}

Sarbanes Transit Center in Silver Spring, Maryland in a video posted to YouTube on Apr 10, 2016.\n\nThe United States Justice Department said that the Washington, D.C. public transit system violated the free speech rights of the Catholic Archdiocese of Washington by refusing to place it's Christmas advertisement on the side of Metro buses.\n\nThe Department of Justice filed a 14-page amicus brief with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on Tuesday in defense of the archdiocese, which is suing the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority after its bus advertisement for the \"Find the Perfect Gift\" Christmas campaign was rejected.\n\nThe advertisement showed a silhouette of three shepherds and their sheep under a starry night. The advertisement also promoted the website, \"FindthePerfectGift.org.\" Upon clicking the link, the page reads \"Jesus is the perfect gift.\"\n\nWMATA maintained that the ad was rejected because it violated guidelines that state that advertisements may not promote or oppose and religion or belief.\n\nThe archdiocese filed a lawsuit against the agency in November. However, a federal judge in December sided with WMATA, saying that the agency has the right to ban posters that have religious content. Although the Christmas season has ended, the archdiocese is continuing its legal battle because it intends to place similar ads in the future and wants WMATA's policy struck down.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions' Justice Department is now asking the Court of Appeals to overturn the federal judge's ruling.\n\n\"WMATA's rejection of the Archdiocese's proposed Christmas advertisement in this case falls squarely within the class of viewpoint discrimination ....,\" the Justice Department brief reads. \"In the context of Christmas advertising, WMATA's guidelines permit messages which generally express commercial or charitable viewpoints, but exclude messages that express religious viewpoints.\"\n\n\"Had Macy's, for example, sought to run a Christmas-themed ad stating, 'Find the Perfect Gift,' and displaying an image of its jewelry, nothing in the guidelines would prohibit the company from doing so. But because the Archdiocese's proposal arguably conveyed the implicit message that 'JESUS is the perfect gift,' WMATA rejected it,\" the brief continued. \"An ad proclaiming that the perfect Christmas gift is jewelry and another that the perfect Christmas gift is Jesus obviously offer competing perspectives on the meaning of the holiday, yet WMATA permits only the former.\"\n\nThe Justice Department argues that the the application of WMATA's guidelines is \"precisely the type of viewpoint discrimination\" that the Supreme Court precluded in the 1995 case of Rosenberger v. University of Virginia, in which the court ruled that the public school may not withhold funding from a Christian student publication that is otherwise available to secular student publications.\n\n\"As the Supreme Court has made clear, the First Amendment prohibits the government from discriminating against religious viewpoints,\" Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand said in a statement. \"By rejecting the Archdiocese's advertisement while allowing other Christmas advertisements, WMATA engaged in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.\"\n\nAccording to the Washingtonian magazine, Metro's policy was revised after Pamela Geller of the American Freedom Defense Initiative attempted to place ads featuring cartoon depictions of the Muslim prophet Muhammad.\n\nSince taking office in 2017, Sessions and President Donald Trump have vowed to promote religious liberty. Last October, Sessions issued a sweeping order on religious freedom, calling on federal agencies to ensure that the religious freedom of people and organizations are protected to the \"greatest extent practicable and permitted by law.\"", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/justice-dept-dc-metro-violated-religious-freedom-archdiocese-blocking-christmas-ads-214140/"}

I tried to explain that I couldn't, because my baby refuses to be covered and she started harping about the children and men who can see my indecency and I need to cover,\" Hornung explained.\n\n\"I said they could practice the simple art of looking away and tried to cite North Dakota breast-feeding laws. She told me if I chose not to cover, then she would have to ask me to leave, so I told her my review would reflect my experience and I would be relaying the experience in every local mommy group,\" she added.\n\nLater the same day Kimberly Flamm, the owner of the store in question, posted a Facebook message of her own where she apologized for the incident.\n\n\"I would like to publicly apologize to Macy Hornung for the way I handled the situation on Saturday,\" Flamm wrote.\n\n\"I ask for your forgiveness on this matter as I learn from it. My goal is to provide a warm and welcoming environment for all of my guests.\"\n\nThe situation continues to spark debates online, with some stating that breast-feeding is not something to be done in a public restaurant.\n\n\"I personally do not want to see a mother breast-feed her child while I am trying to eat my lunch or dinner. I think she only did this to see how far she could push the envelope. I have nothing against breast-feeding but in a public restaurant is not one of them,\" one person wrote.\n\nOthers, such as Lindzey Dianna, pushed back.\n\n\"I'm shocked at some of the comments on here. Are people really that stupid they would get offended over a baby eating? You have 360 degrees to which you can direct your vision, if a mom feeding her child offends you so much, then avert to the remaining 359. If you're still overcome by the awful egregious site of a breast, then you can try eating in the bathroom or your car,\" she wrote.\n\nDebate over breast-feeding was stirred in Christian circles last year as well, when a mother attending an Elevation Church campus in the Ballantyne neighborhood of Charlotte said that she was told to go feed her child in the ladies room, instead of the sanctuary during service.\n\n\"I just got kicked out of church for breast-feeding with a cover on and directed to the bathroom. Shame on you Elevation,\" mother Amanda Zilliken wrote on Facebook in August.\n\nElevation Church released a statement after a GoFundMe campaign began collecting money online to help Zilliken file a lawsuit.\n\n\"We do not have a policy that nursing mothers can't be in the sanctuary,\" the statement clarified.\n\n\"A volunteer had a conversation and felt both parties arrived at the same conclusion to exit mutually.

Well. The journey of a thousand miles begins with a first step. But as he so often does when he\u2019s dealing with matters in the civic and political realm, the pope seems a bit too deferential to established institutions on the matter of truth, objectivity and fairness. He also doesn\u2019t seem to really understand all that well how the digital world works.\n\nAccording to the pope, the devil wants to trick you, but all you have to do is follow the guidance of the media, education and technology establishment and you\u2019ll be fine: \u201cThe tragedy of disinformation is that it discredits others, presenting them as enemies, to the point of demonizing them and fomenting conflict,\u201d the pope wrote, whereas true statements tend to \u201cpromote informed and mature reflection leading to constructive dialogue.\u201d The pope portrayed latter-day makers of fake news as followers of the serpent in the Garden of Eden, the devil, who persuaded Eve to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and thus ushered in the \u201ctragic history of human sin.\u201d Pope Francis praised education and regulation to combat fake news, and encouraged tech and media companies in efforts to verify the \u201cpersonal identities concealed behind millions of digital profiles.\u201d But the pope laid the greatest responsibility with journalists, whom he called on to reject \u201cfalsehoods, rhetorical slogans and sensational headlines\u201d in favor of a \u201cjournalism of peace.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s so much wrong here, it\u2019s hard to know where to start. Clearly, the pope is buying the mainstream media\u2019s default definition of \u201cfake news,\u201d which is the nonsense headlines coming from schlock web sites dressed up to look like mainstream media. There\u2019s one called ABCNews.com.co, for example, that is designed to make people think they\u2019re looking at the ABC News site. Fake! Not really ABC News. That\u2019s easy. But if the pope thinks that\u2019s as fake as fake gets, he\u2019s overlooking the matter of lies told by the real ABC News. Real media! Fake information. See? The news can be just as fake when it\u2019s coming from \u201creal\u201d journalists. And it\u2019s more damaging when that happens because the credibility ascribed to these people - by the likes of the pope, among others - makes ordinary people assume they can believe what they\u2019re being told. Maybe someone needs to sit the pope down and remind him of how Satan really operates. If Satan showed up at your door and handed you a pamphlet that said, \u201cJesus secretly colluded with Russians to import sex slaves to Miami,\u201d or claimed your heretofore unknown Nigerian uncle had a multimillion-dollar fortune for you, not many people would believe him. Nonsense that ham-handed is easily sniffed out, and only the most extremely gullible in our midst are influenced by it. But what the Bible tells us about Satan is that he\u2019s crafty. He doesn\u2019t show up with a pitchfork, devil horns and a tail (even if the Jon Lovitz caricature is one of the funniest things I\u2019ve ever seen). Satan presents himself as having credibility, knowledge, insight and wisdom. He comes off as someone who\u2019s got it together, can earn your trust and has a legitimate claim as an influencer. He seems like someone you should listen to. He seems like someone who will steer you right.", "domain": "canadafreepress.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://canadafreepress.com/print_friendly/pope-gosh-this-fake-news-is-the-work-of-the-devil"}

Let that sink in. Now, one must ask: Does it have to be a Forbes magazine or will any old magazine do?\n\nApparently, Trump wanted to be spanked with a Forbes magazine that had his face on the cover. Yes, Mother Jones confirmed a cover of Forbes does exist with Trump on it. The cover also features son Don Jr. and daughter Ivanka, which is beyond creepy.\n\nTrump also allegedly asked her to accompany him to his hotel room to have sex when they first met but beforehand, he showed her another magazine with him on the cover.\n\nSo apparently, that\u2019s the kink.

Independent voters back the Democrats 45-37 percent.\u2019\n\nAdditionally, a majority of voters want to see Democrats take the majority in the Senate.\n\n\u2018By a similar 52 \u2013 40 percent, voters want the Democrats to take control of the U.S. Senate this year. Independent voters want Democrats in control 47 \u2013 37 percent.\u2019\n\nWhat in the world has happened? In just a year, people are wanting Republicans out of Congress. Quinnipiac found that 78 percent of those polled disapprove of the job Congress is doing. Of that 78 percent, 88 percent were Democrats and 66 percent were Republicans.\n\nRepublicans can thank their own failures on delivering the promises they made to their voters. One of the first orders of business was to repeal and replace Obamacare, and they failed miserably. Worse yet, they failed multiple times.\n\nFurthermore, Republicans failed to deliver a decent candidate in the Alabama Senate race. They gave the people of Alabama such a bad candidate that Alabama actually put a Democrat in the Senate.\n\nThe only major success Republicans have pulled off is passing a tax reform bill and looking at poll results, it may be too late regardless.\n\nWith the possibility of a government shutdown, Republicans are losing ground and Democrats could actually reap the benefits in the 2018 mid-term elections.\n\nAdditionally only 40 percent of voters felt good about the direction America was headed.\n\n\u2018A total of 40 percent of American voters are \u201cvery satisfied\u201d or \u201csomewhat satisfied\u201d with the way things are going in the nation today, as 59 percent are \u201csomewhat dissatisfied\u201d or \u201cvery dissatisfied.\u201d\u2018\n\nThey noted this is actually considered to be the \u201chighest level of satisfaction\u201d since a 2005 poll. However, Tim Malloy, the assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll noted:\n\n\u2018It has been 13 years since Americans have felt this good about life in the U.S., but the numbers suggest there is a long way to go.\u2019\n\nNow, when asked who they would blame for a government shutdown, it was fairly split between Republicans and Democrats. Thirty-two percent would blame Republicans, 34 percent would blame Democrats, and 21 percent would blame Trump himself.\n\nOn the issues, Quinnipiac found 73 percent would support a DACA bill to address the issue of the Dreamers. Out of that 73 percent, Republicans were split with 49 percent supporting one and 40 percent opposing.\n\nOn the issue of the ongoing investigation into Russia\u2019s ties to the Trump campaign, 52 percent felt it was a legitimate investigation compared to 43 percent who felt it was a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nIf Democrats can maintain this momentum, there stands a very good chance that control of the House and Senate will shift from red to blue.

Or are you among the particular people who don\u2019t really finish the job? Be honest now.\n\nWhile clearing off your car may seem like a certain amount of vanity, it is really a functional issue. It helps you see better as you navigate the road. But that is not the only benefit you get from clearing your car of ice and snow. It also helps protect and lives of the other drivers on the road.\n\nIn the viral video we have for you below, you will see the shocking moment a block of ice lifts off a speeding SUV and smashes into the windshield of a car driving behind it.\n\nFortunately, the car that got hit has a dashboard camera running to help protect themselves from accidents like this. Because they have proof that it is the other car\u2019s fault, it will be easier for them to get the insurance company to pay them for the damage.\n\nAlthough the ice block accident happened about two years ago, it is still circulating through the internet. Because climate change is causing such cold, wintry weather this year, people are eager to remember how to stay safe on the road. And the reminder that ice can fly off a person\u2019s car is a good way to recall the facts.\n\nSince it was uploaded, the footage has been viewed more than three million times. And when you press play below you\u2019ll understand why its influence is so far-reaching.\n\nThe victim of the ice attack was Jeffrey Cote. He shared the video and uploaded the following description:\n\n\u201cAn ice sheet flew off the top of an SUV and destroyed my windshield, bent my wiper arm, and damaged my side mirror. Occurred at 8:45 am 12/30/15 on I-495S at Mile 112.8 Car: 2003 Saab 9-5 Aero Wagon,\u201d Cote wrote with complete accuracy. He wanted the situation to be documented correctly. \u201cIf I had braked harder, I could have avoided impact, but it initially appeared the piece was going to fall in front of me.\u201d\n\nWhen it was all said and done, the ice caused a lot of damage to his vehicle, damage that would require the car to be out of commission while it got fixed. And it happened because the SUV driver was too lazy to clean their vehicle correctly.\n\nBecause Cote saw it coming, he wishes that he had avoided it better. But hindsight is always 20-20, as the saying goes.\n\n\u201cThis dashcam video shows what can go wrong if you\u2019re lazy and you don\u2019t clear that huge block of snow and ice off of the roof of your car \u2013 it can fly off and crush the car behind you.\u201d\n\nNow that you have seen the damage that flying ice can cause make sure you go out and clean your car of ice and snow next time you\u2019re hit with a storm this winter.

The school district's appeal for rehearing was subsequently denied by the Beaumont court.\n\nAttorneys for the school district have argued that the lower court's ruling goes against previous federal court precedents, such as the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court's ruling in 2011 in the case of a cheerleader at Silsbee High School who refused to cheer for an athlete who she accused of sexually assaulting her.\n\nThe court reasoned in that case that cheerleaders acted as a \"mouthpiece through which [the school district] could disseminate speech \u2014 namely, support for its athletic teams.\"\n\n\"In federal court, a cheerleader who cheers at a game engages in government speech, but in state court, she engages in private speech,\" lawyer Thomas Brandt wrote in the appeal, according to the Beaumont Enterprise.\n\n\"This creates confusion for all Texas school districts,\" he said, adding that the banners \"were held by public school cheerleaders while they were cheering for the school's football team, while they were in uniform at a school-sponsored event, and while they were on the school's football field to which access was limited by the school.\"\n\nThe First Liberty Institute, a religious freedom law group that is defending the cheerleaders, decried the school district's appeal.\n\n\"The Court of Appeals correctly ruled that the Kountze cheerleaders have a right to have religious speech on their run-through banners \u2014 banners on which the cheerleaders painted messages they chose, with paint they paid for, on paper they purchased. Why is the school district continuing to fight against this decision and the cheerleaders?\" First Liberty Institute lawyer Hiram Sasser said in a statement shared with The Christian Post.\n\n\"When will the school district stop filing appeal after appeal and finally accept that the cheerleaders are free to have religious speech on their run through banners?\" he questioned. \"Hopefully the Texas Supreme Court will not even require the cheerleaders to respond and thus bring an end to the school district's scorched earth litigation tactics against the Kountze cheerleaders. Enough is enough.\"\n\nThe case dates back to 2012 when the Freedom From Religion Foundation, a national organization that advocates for strict adherence to separation of church and state, complained that religious messages on the run-through banners constituted a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.\n\nAccording to the Beaumont Enterprise, the school district's attorneys also argue that the case is now moot because all of the original cheerleaders involved in the case have since graduated or are no longer a part of the team.\n\nHowever, David Starnes, a lawyer who also represented the girls in the case, argues that the case is not moot because the mother of one of the students who didn't make the team in 2017 filed a grievance after her daughter didn't make the team. The mother claimed that her daughter didn't make the team in retaliation for suing the school district, according to the Beaumont Enterprise.\n\n\"It is remarkable that the lawyers for the Kountze School District are making the same, worn-out, rejected arguments, yet again,\" Starnes said in a statement to KFDM/Fox 4. \"Enough is enough. They are fully aware that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1969 that 'It can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.'\"\n\n\"Of course the Ninth Court of appeals simply followed the law and ruled in their favor,\" Starnes continued. \"It is inexplicable that the District's lawyers continue trying to suppress the cheerleaders' constitutionally-protected religious speech, when the well-reasoned opinion of the Ninth Court of Appeals simply follows the U.S. Supreme Court law written in 1969. To do otherwise, would lead to an absurd result. \"", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/school-district-appeals-texas-cheerleaders-bible-verse-case-to-state-supreme-court-214263/"}

By the time they get into their flimsy boats on the Libyan coastline, they have lived many, many dangerous lives. They would have left their increasingly unproductive fields in western and eastern Africa, fled wars in the Horn of Africa, in Sudan and in places as far as Afghanistan, and traveled great distances to get to what they see as the final leg of their journey.\n\nWhat they want is to make it to Europe, which since the early days of colonialism has broadcast itself as the land of milk and honey. Old colonial ideas and the wealth of Europe built from colonial labor beckons. It is a siren for the wretched of the earth. It has ended for many Africans in virtual concentration camps in Libya, where refugees that Europe does not want now linger \u2014 some sold into slavery.\n\nTo get to Libya, the migrants and refugees have to cross the Sahara Desert, which in Arabic is known, rightly, as the Greatest Desert (al-Sahara al-Kubra). It is vast, hot and dangerous. Old salt caravans \u2014 the Azalai \u2014 mostly managed by the Tuareg peoples, would run between Mali as well as Niger and Libya. They would carry gold, salt, weapons and captured human beings as objects of trade.\n\nThose old caravans still make their journey, moving from one water source to the next, the camels as exhausted as the Tuareg. Newer caravans have supplanted these older ones. Camels are not their mode of transport. They prefer buses, pickup trucks and jeeps to ferry humans and cocaine towards Europe, while guns and money comes southwards. These newer caravans drive along unmarked paths, heading between sand dunes, searching for old tire tracks that have been buried in disorienting sandstorms.\n\nSurviving the Sand\n\nThe Sahara is dangerous. The journey in a pickup truck could take three days, at best, or the refugees and cocaine mules could find themselves dying from dehydration, extremists, smugglers or the security forces in the region.\n\nThere are many people ready to prey on the travellers and on the smugglers, whose cars are routinely stolen. No proper account exists of dead refugees. This past June, the UN Refugees Agency reported the death of 44 migrants who died of dehydration and heat stroke when their truck broke down between the Nigerien cities of Agadez and Dirkou.\n\nThe UN had saved at least 600 migrants between April and June. \u201cSaving lives in the desert is becoming more urgent than ever,\u201d said Giuseppe Loprete, the Niger Chief of Mission for the International Organisation for Migration.\n\nTo prevent migrants from reaching the Mediterranean, France has asked five African countries (Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger) to join its G5 Sahel Initiative. The Sahel is the belt that runs across Africa below the Sahara Desert.\n\nThe European Union has also contributed to this project. The Europeans want to move their southern border from the northern edge of the Mediterranean Sea to the southern rim of the Sahara Desert. French military bases run across the Sahel, as the United States builds an enormous base in Agadez (Niger) from where it will fly drones to provide aerial support. The military has arrived in the Sahel to stop the flow of migrants.\n\nCocaine Trail\n\nAgadez, where the United States military is spending $100 million to build its drone base, sits at the crossroads of our contemporary crises. Refugees come to it in desperation, their land made miserable by trade policies that discriminate against small farmers and by desertification caused by carbon capitalism. As the United States government has made it difficult for cocaine to enter the U.S. from Central America, the cocaine mafia have moved its operations to this central belt of Africa.\n\nA leading politician in Niger, Cherif Ould Abidine, who died in 2016, was known as Mr. Cocaine. Billions of dollars of cocaine now moves through the Sahel into the Sahara and upwards to Europe. The pickup trucks that carry refugees and cocaine go past the town of Arlit, where French multinational corporations are harvesting uranium (Oxfam noted in 2013, \u201cOne of every three light bulbs in France is lit, thanks to Nigerien uranium\u201d). So here we have it: refugees, cocaine, uranium and a massive military enterprise.\n\nMen from Gambia and from Mali wait outside a smugglers\u2019 compound. His Toyota Hilux, the camel of this new trade, sits near the gate. The men are wearing sunglasses. This is their defense once they enter the desert. They are apprehensive. Their future, however grim, must be better than their present. These are gamblers. They are willing to take the chance. The engine fires up. They throw their modest belonging onto the truck. It is time for their azalai.\n\nVijay Prashad is the chief editor of LeftWord Books (leftword.com) and the director of Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research.

I want to make this happen,'\" said Rodriguez.\n\nRodriguez also spoke about the \"clarion call\" for border security coming from both the White House and the Republican-controlled Congress.\n\n\"The wall is a physical object created by man. 800,000 human beings created in the Image of God by God,\" noted Rodriguez.\n\n\"So if we have to build a wall in order to secure and save 800,000 lives, let's make that happen as expeditiously as possible ... let's build a wall, simultaneously saving 800,000 kids.\"\n\nAlso in attendance for the press conference were Bishop Harry Jackson, senior pastor of Hope Christian Church, and Congresswoman Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM), chairwoman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\n\nLast September, the Trump administration announced that they were rescinding the Obama-era DACA program, which temporarily protected immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally when they were children.\n\nIn a statement read to the press, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that DACA was being \"rescinded\" as it was viewed as an unlawful unilateral action on the part of the previous administration.\n\n\"This policy was implemented unilaterally to great controversy and legal concern after Congress rejected legislative proposals to extend similar benefits on numerous occasions to this same group of illegal aliens,\" stated Sessions.\n\n\"In other words, the executive branch, through DACA, deliberately sought to achieve what the legislative branch specifically refused to authorize on multiple occasions. Such an open-ended circumvention of immigration laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch.\"\n\nThe full rescinding of DACA was given a six-month delay so that Congress could pass legislation on behalf of those, commonly called Dreamers, threatened with deportation once the program was gone.\n\nEarlier this month, federal judge William Alsup of San Francisco issued a temporary block to the administration's ending of DACA, arguing that the Department of Homeland Security's \"decision to rescind DACA was based on a flawed legal premise.\"\n\n\"As a result, DACA recipients who failed to renew their status by last year's deadline will have a chance to submit renewal applications.

It's a wound to the Church. Sick pastors, who have lost authority and carry on with this double life. Jesus is stern with them. He not only tells people not to listen to them but also to not do what they do. What does He tell them? 'You're white sepulchers.' Beautiful in doctrine on the outside, but rotting within,\" Francis said in a strongly-worded homily at Casa Santa Marta on Jan. 9.\n\nThe pope warned that when pastors begin to lead double lives it is usually a symptom that their prayer life is weak and they have lost touch with the people they are supposed to be serving.\n\n\"This is the end of a pastor who is neither close to God in prayer nor close to the people in compassion,\" he said.\n\nIn November, Francis highlighted how Jesus warned his disciples about the scribes and Pharisees who \"tie up heavy burdens hard to carry and lay them on people's shoulders, but they will not lift a finger to move them.\"\n\n\"This attitude is a wicked exercise of authority,\" he said, noting that spiritual leaders should lead by good example, \"helping others practice what is right and due, supporting them in the trials that they encounter on the path of goodness.\"\n\nWhen authority is exercised badly, the pope explained, \"it becomes oppressive, it does not allow people to grow and it creates a climate of distrust and of hostility, and also brings corruption.\"\n\nThe pope's warning at the time came in light of a report that Indonesian bishop Hubertus Leteng had been accused by dozens of priests in the Diocese of Ruteng of having a mistress and misusing over $120,000 in church funds. He later resigned from his post.\n\nThe pontiff urged pastors who have lost their authority to not lose hope like the high priest Eli in the Bible.\n\nDespite the failure of his two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, to live a life of righteousness, Eli still allowed them to serve as priests in the Tabernacle which angered God and the people of Israel.\n\n\"I say to the pastors who are detached from God and from the people, 'Don't lose hope. There's always another possibility. It was enough for a man to look and approach a woman, listen to her and awaken the authority to bless and prophecy.\n\n\"Accordingly, a son was born to her. Authority. Authority, a gift from God. It only comes from Him. Jesus gives it to His own. Authority in speaking, which comes from closeness to God and to the people. They always go together.

It's just amazing to me and abortion saddens me, period,\" Watson explained. \"But it seems to be something that is really pushed on minorities and provided to minorities especially as something that they should do.

At the event, Watson called on those in attendance to make an impact within their own sphere of influence.\n\n\"This is the power of one.

It is just sad to hear, because obviously there is little to no opportunity for young people. There is little encouragement for them to stay,\" Cantu said.\n\nSeveral church leaders celebrated mass at Holy Family Parish in Gaza on Sunday, as part of the annual Holy Land Coordination, where bishops from around the world meet with Israeli and Palestinian groups in an effort to promote peace.\n\nArchbishop Stephen Brislin of Cape Town, South Africa, said it is understandable why many people are leaving Gaza, despite reconstruction work that's been ongoing since the 2014 conflict.\n\n\"The young people feel they must decide between staying in Gaza or leaving to find schools and jobs in other parts of the world,\" Brislin told CNS.\n\n\"This affects the Christian community. The young people who stay in Gaza are the real heroes. They are willing to sacrifice in order to create families and Christian life in Gaza.\"\n\nThe challenges are massive, however, as young people face nearly 70 percent unemployment in Gaza.\n\nStill, Brislin said it's imperative that the Christian community continues to exist in Gaza, which is known in the Bible as one of the places the Holy Family passed through on their way to Egypt.\n\n\"Basically, people are imprisoned. It can feel very claustrophobic ... for young people with a lot of dreams and hopes and potentials.

Saris said on Wednesday at a hearing in U.S. District Court in Boston.\n\n\"We don't want to put them on the ship unless someone\" can review their contention that deportation back to Indonesia is \"a really bad situation for them,\" she added, according to The Boston Globe.\n\nSaris was referencing a case in 1939 when an ocean liner filled with 937 passengers, mostly Jews, left Germany for America, but was turned away by government officials. Hundreds of those Jews were reporedly later killed during the Holocaust.\n\nSaris has ruled in favor of the Christians on a number of occasions against the Trump administration, and in November said that immigration officials do not have the right to carry out immediate deportations.\n\nThe believers fear that they will face persecution, torture, and possibly death if they are sent back home to the world's largest Muslim nation.\n\nMost of the Indonesians came to the U.S. in the late 1990s and 2000s, fleeing anti-Christian violence. Although many overstayed their visas, U.S. authorities allowed them to stay based on certain conditions, such as checking in regularly.\n\nThey have been caught up in the net of Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration, however, and in August immigration officials told them they only have 30 days to get a plane ticket and depart the country.\n\nAttorneys for the Christians are arguing that their clients deserve the right to at least challenge the deportation orders, and raise their fears of persecution with the Board of Immigration Appeals.\n\nThe Justice Department has argued that the Indonesians have not proven that they are likely to face persecution or torture if they are sent back home, however.\n\n\"Their assertion that 'all face a significant risk of persecution and torture if removed to Indonesia' is unsupported by facts that relate to any specific petitioner,\" DOJ lawyers have said.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who brokered the deal in 2009 that allowed the Christians to stay in seacoast communities in New Hampshire, has insisted that they do face significant religious persecution back home.\n\n\"Deporting these individuals will needlessly split families and communities, and put lives in danger. I'll continue to make every effort to prevent these deportations so that the Indonesian community can continue to live peacefully in New Hampshire,\" Shaheen said last year.\n\nMeldy Lumangkun, one Indonesian Christian, told ICE officials in Manchester that there is also concern for the children.\n\n\"We are afraid to go home.

Singer Abel Makkonen Tesfaye, popularly known as \"the Weeknd,\" has canceled his partnership with the company.\n\nThere has been intense global backlash over the advertising. At least two H&M outlets in South Africa were trashed by the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters party during anti-racism protests that forced the company to close all of its stores in that country on Saturday.\n\nA Fortune report said the company announced Annie Wu as their new global leader for diversity and inclusiveness on Tuesday. She was already the global manager for employee relations.\n\n\"The recent incident was entirely unintentional, but it demonstrates so clearly how big our responsibility is as a global brand,\" H&M said in a message on Instagram. \"Our commitment to addressing diversity and inclusiveness is genuine, therefore we have appointed a global leader, in this area, to drive our work forward.\"\n\nBryant charged, however, that despite the company's apology, it has no real commitment to diversity and inclusion.\n\n\"Don't walk away from H&M just for today. Shut the door,\" he told his supporters. \"Save your apology H&M.

By better understanding the other signs, and their basic traits, we can also understand the type of person we are dealing with.\n\nAnd if you weren\u2019t born yesterday, it\u2019s likely that you have met some pretty dishonest and fake people within your lifetime. Of course, these aren\u2019t the worst people in the world, but they can be just as toxic within your life. So which zodiac signs are the most genuine and honest, and which ones are completely on the other side of the scale? Well, I am glad you asked.\n\nIf any sign from the entire zodiac is known for their complete honesty, it is the Sagittarius. Actually, the Sagittarius believes in morality and is against lying so very much that they may even offend you with how honest they are. While it may come off as brutal, they truly only mean the best.\n\n2. Aries\n\nSimilar to the Sagittarius, the Aries is a sign of brutal honesty. If you do something stupid, they will tell you, with no holds barred. However, while the Sagittarius means well, the Aries is a little more offensive about it. But, don\u2019t take it too hard, as it is just a major aspect of their personality.\n\n3. Aquarius\n\nAquarius could possibly be considered one of the most genuine signs of the zodiac. Their honesty is rooted in their desire to be themselves, and due to this, they refuse to tell anything but the truth. Thankfully, in contrast to the Aries and Sagittarius, they are a bit more kind about it.\n\n4. Libra\n\nLibras are very passionate individuals with a high-level of morality. If they feel strongly about someone or something, they will become the most driven individuals in the zodiac. Because of this, they are also one of the most genuine.\n\nBecause of Capricorn\u2019s very strong self-discipline, they are known for coming through on their word. To the Capricorn, their word should mean something and they will stop and nothing to make sure that it remains as so.\n\n6. Cancer\n\nNot only do Cancers say what they feel, but they also are able to maintain deep emotional bonds with other people, which they feel are truly important to them on a major level. Because of this, the Cancer lives their life as ethically as possible.\n\n7. Scorpio\n\nWhile Scorpio is one of the most loyal signs of the zodiac, they are also known for their honesty. However, while they are loyal and honest, their passion for others can also cause them to come off as jealous or possessive.\n\n8. Leo\n\nLeos, similar to Capricorns regard themselves highly and have much self respect. While they won\u2019t outright tell a major lie, embellishing the truth is not beyond their scope of capability.\n\n9. Pisces\n\nAs an intuitive sign, Pisces also has a sense of exactly how much they can get away with or what is better to keep hidden from the general public. Similar to Leos, they won\u2019t tell an outright lie, but they will bend the truth a bit to protect themselves or others.\n\n10. Taurus\n\nThe Taurus is a sign that can be a bit split. While they will readily provide you with factual information, they may censor themselves from telling the entire truth, or hold back entire scenarios for their own benefit.\n\n11. Virgo\n\nVirgo and Gemini are tied for the most dishonest. While Virgo can be a stickler in many ways, their overactive imaginations can lead to various lies. Sometimes, they may not even intend to lie to you, however, their imaginations kick in and create scenarios that aren\u2019t entirely true.\n\n12. Gemini\n\nFinding themselves at the bottom of this list, it has been said that you can tell if a Gemini is lying by whether or not their mouth is moving. Furthermore, the Gemini will not only lie continuously, they may even lose track of their lies, leading to more and more lies until they are caught.\n\nFeatured image via Little Info Cue", "domain": "awarenessact.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://awarenessact.com/the-truly-genuine-and-honest-signs-of-the-zodiac-ranked-from-most-to-least/"}

It is weed killer, of course.\n\nGlyphosate has even been linked to cancer. In 2015, the World Health Organization declared the chemical as \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans\u201d. The observation was based on animal tests, test tube studies, and observational studies. Mice and rat studies showed that the chemical produced the growth of tumors after the ingestion of the chemical.\n\nA few of the cases were even linked to non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer that originates in white blood cells. This cancer cripples the immune system and will leave you for dead. Are we really okay will eating foods that are so likely to cause such a disease?

We share information almost daily about how to cure it and the things that cause it but could the cure to cancer really be this simple?\n\nAccording to Gregg Braden, an American author when it comes to cancer therapy our minds play a much bigger role than we would initially think. How we feel significantly affects our DNA. He suggests that through the power of collective thought we could have a positive effect in treating all sorts of diseases, not just cancer.\n\nRight off the bat, you may think this sounds like a load of bullshit and I could see why. However, this theory does not push that you need to be religious in order to do this, a matter of face you do not have to be religious at all for this to work. Braden believes there is a field that unites everything. This field he is referring to is one that has been scientifically proven and explained in the science journal Nature No. 332 back in 1996.\n\nNow many are still quite skeptical about this but the video below as you will see shows this theory in action. In the video, you can see plain as day cancer being eliminated in about three minutes or less. The whole process is demonstrated over an ultrasound screen and is quite interesting to watch.\n\nBraden says this works because of the strong electromagnetic radiation being produced during the video. He says that if you want to be able to do this yourself you will need to learn to focus and enhance your effects. This is something he claims lots of practice can show you how to do.

Sounds tasty doesn\u2019t? When one couple gathered some eggs from their hen, they came across a very large egg.

It turns out this is a normal egg with the yolk and white intact.\n\nApparently, there is a name for such a phenomenon and an egg inside an egg is known as a counter-peristalsis contraction, which means that the egg that had already gone through the hen\u2019s oviduct gets sucked back up before it has a chance to finish developing, thus allowing another egg to develop around it.\n\n\u201cSometimes, if you have another ovulation before the first egg is laid, you have a \u2018counter-peristalsis contraction,\u2019 which means the oviduct will contract upward, and the first egg will be moved back up,\u201d Poultry Science editor Gregory Bedecarats said. \u201cWhen you see a tiny egg incorporated in a larger one, it means the egg was still present in the shell gland and got sucked back up the oviduct to where the other egg was having its white deposited.\u201d\n\nThe result is a \u201cmega-egg.\u201d\n\nThe owner of the hen that laid this egg was worried that the hen didn\u2019t die when the egg was coming out.\n\nBecause all those who were present for the big \u201cmega-egg reveal\u201d were too scared to eat the egg, the wife used it as an ingredient in her hair conditioner.\n\nCommenters felt sorry for the hen that had to push the mega-egg out\u2026\n\n\u201cPoor chicken that had to push that monster out hahaha.\u201d\n\nAnd they certainly found the humor in the case of the massive egg\u2026\n\n\u201cWell, the question \u201cwhich came first: the chicken or the egg?\u201d should wait a little bit longer.\u201d\n\nEvidently, eggs aren\u2019t the only thing that comes in doubles\u2026\n\n\u201cI have seen that happen once before when my aunt had chickens.

There is really no time like the week of Thanksgiving to dabble in these types of thoughts, which is why you are about to be enlightened by the truth behind that classic pumpkin pie holiday dish. Believe it or not, it wasn\u2019t your grandmother who came up with the tasty dessert. While she may not like the fact that she is no longer deserving of the credit, rest assured, the original pumpkin pie was made far differently than the one that we know today.\n\nAnd it was invented by the pilgrims!\n\nToday, pumpkin pie looks like any other pie, brimming with a tasty filling and topped with sweet whipped cream. It\u2019s top is smooth, its crust is hearty and it simply looks delicious. But, when the pilgrims first made this holiday favorite, it looked a lot different than what we know today. Instead of a smooth pie exterior, the recipe of the past looked more like a pie, literally inside a pumpkin.\n\nIf you feel like getting in touch with history this Thanksgiving, you can try out the pilgrims\u2019 version of pumpkin pie\u2026\n\n-First, you are going to get a pie pumpkin. These aren\u2019t your average carving pumpkins, instead they are a little bit flatter, with grooves on the outside. They are also known as sugar pumpkins, and are smaller in shape than the monstrous pumpkins you\u2019d find at your typical pumpkin patch. Pie pumpkins are commonly found in the grocery store in the produce section or at farm stands. This small, round pumpkin is packed full of flesh that makes it a good choice for cooking. The pulp also has a better texture, is sweeter, and a lot less grainy.\n\n-Slice off the top of the pumpkin and clean out the inside, scooping diligently with your hand until it\u2019s free of the guts and seeds.\n\n-Set the pumpkin on a cookie sheet and cover with foil. You will then bake it at 400 degrees until it\u2019s tender. A fork should easily be able to cut through the outside. A 15 pound pumpkin takes two hours to reach tender status, so do the math and bake accordingly.\n\nNow, it\u2019s time to make the custard. For this, you will need\u2026\n\n\n\n-8 eggs\n\n-1 cup brown sugar\n\n-1 1/4 teaspoon pumpkin spice\n\n-2 cans of evaporated milk (24 ounces)\n\n-Whisk all custard ingredients together, until smooth and blended. It will be a liquid consistency.\n\n-Use a ladle to remove any excess liquid from the inside of the pumpkin\n\n-Pour the custard into the inside of the pumpkin.\n\n-Lower the oven to 350 degrees and bake the pumpkin for one hour or until the custard firms up.\n\nYour end result should look like your pie pumpkin on the outside. When you cut into it, you will surprise your guests with a tasty custard filling. It definitely looks more festive than the pumpkin pies that we\u2019ve been raised to know.\n\nMaybe you will bring back an old classic to your family\u2019s Thanksgiving table!", "domain": "awm.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://awm.com/ive-eaten-it-all-my-life-but-had-no-idea-this-is-how-it-was-supposed-to-be-made-video-2/"}

For those who cannot or choose not to provide valid documentation about their country of origin (a majority), they would have to pay back all the welfare benefits they received before even being considered for permanent status.\n\nBreitbart Migrants who have lived on state handouts will have their citizenship applications denied in a monumental move to prevent foreign welfare abusers from living in Switzerland and on taxpayer funds indefinitely.\n\nThe new regulations will make it impossible for asylum seekers and migrants who have lived off state handouts in the last three years to become citizens even if they have lived in Switzerland as permanent residents for the required time to make a citizenship application, Kronen Zeitung reports\n\nThe previous law allowed migrants to apply for citizenship as long as they were not on state benefits at the time of their application. Along with the welfare stipulation, the new act requires migrants to demonstrate a greater level of integration than before including making them prove they have a certain number of Swiss friends and acquaintances.\n\nLanguage requirements vary by canton with most expecting an intermediate level of language proficiency judged on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) at the B1 or B2 level.\n\nWhile Switzerland is not a member of the European Union, asylum seekers have attempted to flood into the country through the southern Italian border. While many have used Switzerland as a transit country to reach Germany, others have remained in the Alpine state.\n\nVarious cantons and cities in Switzerland have attempted to push back against the tide of migrants by making it less appealing for them to come to the country. Late last year, the city of Zurich voted to dramatically cut benefits to failed asylum seekers who were in so-called \u201cF-status\u201d in which they cannot be deported.\n\nAn estimated 5,300 failed asylum seekers live in the Z\u00fcrich canton with \u201cF Status\u201d meaning that whilst they have failed in their asylum claim, the government cannot deport them back to their home country because of potential dangers to them.\n\nFormerly, migrants with F status received around 900 Swiss Francs (\u00a3691) per month but now will receive only the emergency fund amount of 360 Swiss Francs (\u00a3276) each month.\n\nThe legislation has gone into effect as of January 1 and will urge migrants to obtain full-time employment as well as reimburse the nation for any welfare received during their stay. Those who meet this requirement will have the right to apply for Swiss citizenship, a privilege that countless migrants have sought in order to exempt them from extradition in the event that they are convicted of a deportable offense.\n\nThe law will also make permanent residence documents granted to asylum seekers and migrants invalid as long as they have lived on welfare benefits in the last 3 years. The previous legislation provided a loophole for welfare abusers who were not receiving state handouts only during the time of their application.\n\nMany of the migrants entering Switzerland have also come without any form of identification, making it even more difficult to process their asylum claim or deport those not approved for asylum status.\n\nSimonetta Sommaruga revealed late last year that the government is unaware of the true identity of nine out of 10 asylum seekers in the country, mainly because they discard any documents they had, and try to claim to be refugees from Syria, which they believe will give them priority status.

This precise incident did occur for staff at a Sydney pub, who had to admit they served a steak riddled with larvae to unsuspecting customers.\n\nThe unfortunate recipient was Stella Kim, who still gets ill when recounting the night of her anniversary. A special night turned sour to say the least.\n\nFor the Ranch Hotel, located on Sydney\u2019s north shore, the PR disaster relief is not going to be enough to save the face of the establishment.\n\nThe pub insists they are adamant about food safety, but also admit to letting these larvae sneak onto the meat before being served up.\n\nKim had picked the hotel as the romantic location to celebrate 1,000 days with her partner Sushil Lamichhane.\n\nBoth ordered steaks, but when they arrived it did not take long to notice the little critters.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe if this was real. It was horrible, unbelievable,\u201d said Kim to News.com.au. \u201cmaggots were crawling over and there was a lot of them. IT was like a rotten carcass.\u201d\n\nThe Facebook video gives a good enough idea of what it looked like for the couple, who lost their appetite for a few days afterward.\n\nThe Ranch Hotel is one of the most pre-eminent establishments in Australia. It is owned by Australian Leisure and Hospitality (ALH) Group, which is a collaboration between the Mathieson Family and Woolworths, a major retailer.\n\nThe pub issued a statement from management on their website shedding more light on the situation. Apparently of the 262 steaks, they sold that day, only one was returned for cleanliness reasons.\n\n\u201cOur investigation concluded that the incident was due to blowfly larva laid after the meal was cooked, as it is not possible for larvae to survive the cooking process,\u201d read the statement.\n\n\u201cAll our kitchen staff are experienced and accredited in food safety and The Ranch stands by its food safety record and processes.\u201d\n\nThe pub also reached out to apologize to Kim as well as report their own mishap to local government.\n\nThe rationale given by the Pub has not convinced Ms. Kim. \u201cThe Ranch has been saying this happened instantaneously and worms burst out somewhat like the Big Bang that created our universe,\u201d says Kim.\n\n\u201cIf someone is (an) expert in biology and thermodynamics, please review the video so that they are educated on food handling.\u201d\n\nThis echoes the attitude many customers of the pub have towards the rationale given by the pub \u2013 and like Kim, some of them may avoid The Ranch all-together in future because of it.\n\nHowever, another example of maggots in steak indicates The Ranch was correct in their assessment.\n\nIn July, a family in Melbourne found maggots in a steak they bought in the supermarket that emerged only after cooking.\n\nThe meat had a couple of weeks before it was past its use date, and was just kept in the fridge before barbequing to keep it fresh.\n\nAccording to the Skye Blackburn, an expert in entomology in the employ of food chain Aldi, has taken a closer look at the meat supplied to the family.\n\n\u201cIt is most likely that the eggs had been laid after this meat had been cooked, and the heat of the meat has accelerated the hatching of the eggs,\u201d says Blackburn.\n\nBlackburn went on to explain in more detail. \u201cHeat allows eggs the potential to hatch within minutes of being laid. Due to higher than average temperatures we\u2019re experiencing at the moment, it is common for the life cycle of insects to occur more quickly.\u201d", "domain": "awm.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://awm.com/couple-orders-steak-at-anniversary-dinner-when-it-gets-to-the-table-they-see-it-crawling-video/"}

But vegans who saw the image were furious. They began lashing out at the cops for posting the photo of the hearty breakfast.\n\nBut the North Wales Police Rural Crime Team had simply posted the photo to support the local farmers in response to the National Farmers Union (NFU) posted a \u201cfarmhouse breakfast\u201d campaign meeting.\n\nThe cops spared no expense when cooking their breakfast to support the farmers. It includes plump breakfast sausages, dozens of perfectly poached eggs, ham, baked beans and enough slices of toast for each officer.\n\nThe image was posted to Twitter, and most people were happy to see the rural police force supporting the farmers in the area.\n\nBut one woman named Diana, who claims to be a vegan, lashed out and wrote:\n\n\u201cSpeaking as a taxpayer, I\u2019d prefer them to be less selective when answering questions and perhaps not post breakfast pics that offend vegetarian/vegan followers \u2013 pretty thoughtless considering the job title they have.\u201d\n\nAlthough Diana thought she had a good argument, many other members of the community were quick to retaliate. Farmer Jono Dixon shared the following in response to Diana\u2019s post:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pathetic. The vegans are ruling the roost. They are nothing more than a menace. We as carnivores or vegetarians don\u2019t dictate about there preferred diet so its time they stopped trolling and whining about everyone\u2019s daily diets.\u201d\n\nAlthough people were eager to hear what Rural Crime Team leader Rob Taylor had to say in response to Diana\u2019s vegan outburst, he said his lack of response had nothing to do with the vegans who found the breakfast feast \u201coffensive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe regularly get 1m impressions each month, and in August alone we had 1.9m impressions,\u201d Crime Team leader Taylor said. \u201cWe just can\u2019t answer (all inquiries) anymore as it\u2019s a huge commitment. Over Christmas, we had too much general interaction with people from various walks of life bombarding our feed with questions, and we couldn\u2019t cope.\u201d\n\nBecause the rural cops care about the farmers in their area, they plan to continue to post to their Twitter page. They have about 15,000 followers and an extensive reach on social media. Most of their followers love them and support everything they do.\n\nAlthough the Rural Crime Team refused to admit that the vegans had won, since Christmas Day, they have not posted any more images showcasing the eggs and bacon they eat to start off their day of crime fighting.\n\nThey did share the following post:\n\n\u201cWe have considered all options, and from immediate effect, we will cease responding to comments and questions until further notice.\u201d\n\nReaders of Metro generally did not find the sausage \u201coffensive,\u201d but felt that way about the vegan post.\n\n\u201cPrevious generation: \u2018Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me.\u2019 Today\u2019s generation: \u2018Everything hurts.\u2019\u201d\n\nDo you think it is okay for the police to share an image of their breakfast if it includes meat?", "domain": "awm.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://awm.com/vegans-response-to-cop-sharing-photo-of-cooked-breakfast-to-support-local-farmers-goes-viral/"}

Do you think this is fair?\n\nAlthough the two McCormick ground black pepper tins appear to be the same size \u2013 which they are \u2013 the one of the left contains 8 ounces of product while the one of the right only contains 6 ounces. The smaller tin on the left, which houses the Watkins ground black pepper, houses 6 ounces of product.\n\nEven though McCormick and Watkins sell the same amount of product in their tins, McCormick uses a larger container to fool the customer into thinking they\u2019re getting more pepper.\n\nBecause of this deceit, Watkins has sued McCormick. They argue that McCormick is deceiving their customers by reducing the amount of pepper in their non-see-through containers while not changing the size of the tin. Although the product says 6 ounces on the bottom instead of 8 ounces, it is written in tiny font that only the most astute shopper would notice.\n\nAccording to the original Watkins PR release, \u201cMcCormick has been illegally \u201cslack filling\u201d (under-filling tins) its ground black pepper in tins in a manner that misleads retailers and consumers and is an illegal, deceptive marketing practice.\u201d\n\nWatkins has claimed the McCormick\u2019s deceitful marketing tactic had hurt sale of spices. When put side by side, the customer invariably assumes that the McCormick brand is selling more ground black pepper \u2013 but in truth, the containers hold the same amount.\n\nOn the other hand, McCormick says they have not falsely advertised their product. Why? Because the correct product weight is listed on the tin.\n\nBut now McCormick isn\u2019t just being sued by Watkins. They also face a class-action lawsuit from consumers who feel that they\u2019ve been tricked and swindled out of their ground pepper. Have you bought the new tin of McCormick ground black pepper without knowing?\n\nThis case currently makes its way through the federal courts. As consumers, don\u2019t trust any products you buy. Inspect them and make sure you\u2019re getting what you think you\u2019re getting because companies are all too eager to rip you off at any opportunity they can get.\n\n\u201cIntegrity in the marketplace is fundamental,\u201d said Mark Jacobs, CEO of Watkins, \u201cFor nearly 150 years Watkins has built its reputation with consumers as a premium high quality products company with impeccable honesty and business ethics. As America\u2019s first consumer products company to offer a money-back satisfaction guarantee in 1868, we stand behind the quality and value of our products, and believe the consumer always deserves full transparency to determine value.\u201d\n\nDo you think McCormick is deceiving you as a customer?", "domain": "awm.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://awm.com/it-might-not-seem-important-but-it-is-can-you-spot-the-difference-between-the-two-tins-8/"}

This profile sketch went viral on social media sites as people began to realize he is missing an ear and has a rather strange moustache \u2013 clearly something was up. Those responsible for the sketch insist only 1% of people will be able to decipher the animal in the picture within 2 minutes.\n\nAre you able to spot it? Do you think it\u2019s only part of an animal head rather than the whole thing? Did you spot it within two minutes? Doing these kinds of experiments are a fun way to keep your brain active and your eyes a flutter as the day rolls on.\n\nThe test is just like one of many optical illusions being shared around the internet these days. These optical illusions might be inspired by psychological testing material because it\u2019s true that psychologists do a fair amount of visual cue testing.\n\nHave you ever heard of the Rorschach test?\n\nIt\u2019s a psychological test in which a patient interprets what they see in different inkblots on paper. These interpretations are recorded and analyzed by the psychologist.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry, this face is not some kind of psychological assessment. It\u2019s merely an optical illusion meant to surprise people and expand their minds! Can a face really look like an animal when looked at in a different way? After seeing this face we know that it can.\n\nSince it\u2019s not a test, there is no pressure to try and get it in under two minutes. If you do get it, then you can count yourself in the 1% of people who have incredible skill at analyzing complex images. You would make a great forensic psychologist or computer programmer (if you are not already one!).\n\nAnd since it\u2019s all for fun, we will give you a hint to help you succeed (because we really want you to succeed!)\n\nPay special attention to the right side of the man\u2019s head. It is from this odd-shape that you should approach the image. Think of all the features of the face in relation to this starting point, and begin to see what two pieces match together.\n\nWe also suggest looking up animal images on Google to get an idea of the shape, size, and contours of animal heads you think might just be the one. The more you search, the closer you will come to understanding the cartoon-like design of the man\u2019s head.\n\nDon\u2019t worry about doing a little research on the side \u2013 no one said it was out of bounds.\n\nTake it as the starting point for interpreting the rest of the shapes \u2013 and if you\u2019re lucky, you will be part of the hallowed 1%!\n\nThink you have it down?

Then came Amazon's Alexa in 2014 and Google Assistant in 2016. These programs are designed to take commands by accurately recognizing the voice of the device owner.\n\nHowever, an exclusive report from The Intercept recently revealed that it was the NSA which had actually developed a seemingly effective voice-recognition system dating back to 2004. The report cited a classified NSA memo dated 2006 that listed the accomplishments of the agency's voice-identification system and provided some details on how it worked.\n\nLike many technological developments, NSA's reported voice-recognition system started with human work. According to the 2006 document, transcribers working on SIGINT (gathering intelligence by intercepting signals) were later able to identify subjects through \"his voice and by his unique way of speaking.\"\n\nLater, by applying mathematical formulas and algorithms, the process has reportedly performed \"surprisingly more robust and consistent than humans.\"\n\nThe Intercept added that while NSA had been using fingerprints and facial recognition methods to track down their targets, the agency also saw a number of successes with voiceprints - a collection of speech-related information that noted that every individual has distinct voice characteristics due to specific qualities such as the \"shape of the mouth\" and the \"length of the larynx.\"\n\nThe same report took note of pieces of information previously revealed by Edward Snowden that claimed the NSA had tools match a target's voice through an alleged database of intercepted voice and video calls even if they were using foreign languages, secret codes or phone numbers.\n\nMeanwhile, it is unknown whether the reported NSA voice-recognition tool has had an actual effect on consumers, especially now that voice-activated digital assistants have become a staple in newer smartphone models.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that programs like Alexa and Siri effectively work through the storage of vital biometric information from their users. It can be recalled that last year, Apple did reveal that governments had made requests to collect customer data for various reasons including cases of fraud and the suspected illegal use of their products and services. As the company claimed, these requests require search warrants but reports noted that these types of letters from governments often come with a gag order.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/nsa-has-been-running-a-voice-recognition-system-since-2004-says-report-214949/"}

Vice President Mike Pence addresses Chamber of Commerce ''Invest in America!'' summit in Washington U.S., on May 18, 2017.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence, who is on a four-day trip to the Middle East, met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi in Egypt and King Abdullah II in Jordan, and saw anger in the region over President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Pence assured allies of U.S. support for two-state solution if both sides agree.\n\nIn his meeting with the Egyptian president Saturday, which lasted for about two and a half hours, Pence was told Trump's decision can potentially complicate negotiations over a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAt a press conference later, Pence called it \"a disagreement between friends,\" according to the Los Angeles Times. He added that he assured Sisi that the Trump administration will back a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians if both parties agree. \"My perception was that he was encouraged by that message,\" he told reporters.\n\nThe two leaders also discussed how to deal with Americans imprisoned by Egypt and also about terrorism and North Korea's nuclear program.\n\nHowever, U.S. reporters and a Pence aide were initially not allowed to leave their van at the presidential palace in Cairo, according to the Journal. With the help of colleagues outside, Pence's aide was finally able to enter the palace. And only after Pence raised the issue directly with Sisi did the Egyptians later allow the press to take pictures and listen to brief remarks.\n\nIn Jordan, Pence and King Abdullah \"emphasized the strength of the strategic Jordanian U.S. relationship as well the role the U.S. plays in ensuring regional stability,\" according to the Jordanian embassy in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"They also discussed efforts to end the Syrian crisis as well as the importance of international cooperation in efforts to bring a political solution to this crisis. Both sides also discussed efforts to revive the Palestinian Israeli peace process and means to bring both sides back to the negotiation table,\" the embassy said in a statement.\n\nAbdullah had warned against declaring Jerusalem Israel's capital.\n\nPence's Middle East trip will end in Israel, where he will meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and address the Israeli legislature as well as visit the Western Wall.\n\nPence will not meet Palestinian leaders.\n\nThe office of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas had also said he would not meet with Pence during his visit to the West Bank \"because the U.S. has crossed red lines\" on Jerusalem.\n\nTrump announced last month that the U.S. will be beginning a process to move its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and officially recognize the city as Israel's capital. \"While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today, I am delivering,\" he said at the time.\n\nThe status of Jerusalem has been up for dispute for centuries, with the Romans, Crusaders, Ottomans and the British Empire among the factions fighting historical battles for control over the city.\n\nJerusalem contains numerous sacred sites claimed by Christians, Jews, and Muslims, and is where Jesus Christ preached, died, and was later resurrected.\n\nBritish rule over the area ended in 1948, which led to Jordan's invasion and occupation of the Old City, before Israel captured the land in the 1967 Middle East war. In 1980 Israel declared Jerusalem to be a \"complete and united\" city and capital of its country, to the protest of Arab countries in the region.\n\nPalestinians, on the other hand, see East Jerusalem as their capital. They live in the city as Israeli residents, receive access to services and vote in municipal elections.

Marriott Hotel in downtown Washington, several speakers stressed the importance for Christians to articulate a value for life at every stage. Particular emphasis was given to the unborn as conference attendees participated in the March for Life Friday, the largest annual pro-life gathering in the nation. The conference was sponsored by Focus on the Family and the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, the policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention.\n\n\"The overturning of Roe v. Wade is necessary for justice but the overturning of Roe v. Wade does not by itself constitute justice,\" said Moore, president of the ERLC in an interview with The Christian Post.\n\nOverturning the contentious 1973 case that legalized abortion nationwide would simply send the matter back to the states and culture, he pointed out.\n\n\"But we also have to be working at dealing with the root of the problem as well. It's a both/and not an either/or,\" he said, mentioning a feminist leader and abortion rights advocate whose words haunt him; this feminist leader once said that \"most Americans are pro-life with three exceptions: rape, incest, and my situation.\"\n\n\"When one looks around and sees the culture in American life of the self and of protection of self it inevitably leads to an abortion culture. We have to address that as well,\" Moore said, adding that \"this is not a four- or five-year project. This is going to have to be a 100-year project.\"\n\nMoore, who during the 2016 election was a vocal critic of then candidate Donald Trump, has since praised the president's moves toward protecting the unborn while urging the administration to take a different approach toward immigrants and refugees.\n\n\"I think there's a sense in which sometimes it is difficult to say political allies on one issue does not mean that a person is adopting completely everything that the movement articulates,\" Moore said when asked about Trump's favorable moves toward protecting the unborn but unfavorable rhetoric and posture toward refugees and immigrants.\n\n\"Politics is important but politics is not ultimate, and so we are not afraid of it but we don't idolize it either \u2014 that everything is not utopia or dystopia at any given moment.\"\n\nIn his remarks at the conference, the ERLC president noted that a culture that values life cannot simultaneously value hedonism and pornography. The pro-life witness will never flourish where women are not valued, he said.\n\n\"There was a time when churches were reluctant to talk about healthy sexuality but that has changed but not in ways that are altogether good,\" Moore told CP.\n\n\"I will often see Song of Solomon preached sort of as a how-to guide to better sex rather than getting at the deeper fabric of what human sexuality is. I also think we have to have moral credibility on issues of sexuality. If God has revealed something to us about sexuality, and He has, we have to speak consistently both about sin and about the offer of grace.\"\n\nChurches cannot do this while ignoring the ravages of the divorce culture and refusing to speak to the issues of abuse, he continued to explain, a topic that has been accentuated as credible allegations of sexual misconduct by top leaders in many industries have surfaced in recent months.\n\nMoore further recalled that he was once debating abortion with a pro-choice advocate who said, \"Well, if you all care about unborn children, why don't you adopt some children.\"\n\n\"And I said, 'I have so have many people that I know.' And the response was almost immediately 'Isn't it terrible that you religious people are adopting children and inculcating them into your worldview.'\"\n\n\"The idea, as [former Congressman] Barney Frank said years ago, 'pro-lifers begin at conception and ends at birth,' is not true. And at the local level in many ways the pro-life movement has demonstrated that better than anyone,\" Moore said.\n\nThe Evangelicals for Life conference also showcased the continuing growth and work of pro-life crisis pregnancy centers.\n\n\"When I look at the sorts of ministries, too numerous to even count, that are helping vulnerable women, I can think of countless ministries that deal with the full range of the human experience where they're not simply talking about abortion decision itself, but getting at the root of what's going on in that woman's life and loving her,\" Moore said.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/to-build-pro-life-culture-christians-must-address-culture-of-self-evangelical-214559/"}

Moses, King David and thousands of years of Jewish history would disagree. Israel and the Jews are part of the story of human civilization. Over 50% of the human race has a holy book that tells of the Jewish journey to Israel. That includes Mohammed\u2019s own copy of the Koran. Israel isn\u2019t a \u201ccolonial enterprise\u201d. Palestine is. Anyone who wants to find out where the name Israel comes from can open the Book of Genesis 32:29. The story even appears in Islamic hadiths. But where does \u201cPalestine\u201d really come from?\n\nPalestine isn\u2019t a Hebrew or Arabic word Palestine isn\u2019t a Hebrew or Arabic word. The Greeks used it to describe the area. And when the Romans and their Arab mercenaries repressed the indigenous Jewish population, they renamed it all Palestine. Palestine, after the Philistines: but why did the Greeks and Romans name the area after the Philistines? The Philistines were one of the Greek origin sea peoples who had originally invaded and colonized the area. The Jewish resistance to Philistine colonialism is chronicled in the histories of Samson, King Saul and King David. It was natural for the Greek and Roman colonies that the Jews of the Second Temple era clashed with to use \u201cPalestine\u201d, the name associated with earlier colonies, to refer to their new colonies. That latest phase of Greek colonialism led to an extended conflict between the Persian Empire and Greco-Roman civilization. The Romans made extended use of Arab mercenaries and rulers to secure their dominions. One such ruler was Herod, the son of an Idumean father and a Nabatean Arab mother, (according to the Greek historian Strabo they were both Arabic peoples), who repressed the Jews. The eventual decline and fall of the Roman and Persian empires made way for the Islamic conquests of the region. But the Islamic bandit hordes had no original ideas. Their religion was a hodgepodge of Judaism, Christianity, assorted pagan beliefs and Mohammed\u2019s violent fantasies. The rest of their culture they took wholesale from the Greeks. This game of historical Idiocracy ended with a collection of Arab colonists who call themselves \u201cPalestinians\u201d and claim to be descended from\u2026 somebody. In Germany, Abbas declared that, \u201cthe nation of Palestine, throughout its long history, has been a beacon of generosity, and our people are an extension of the 3,500-year-old Canaanite civilization.\u201d The Palestinian Authority that the unelected dictator runs was created in 1993. There was never any such independent country before that. And inquiring minds would love to know what an Islamic terrorist group and the Arab clans it oversees have in common with the Canaanite civilization. Fire, the wheel?\n\nAbbas also insisted that, \u201cMohammed the Prophet was a Palestinian\u201d But then, Abbas also insisted that, \u201cMohammed the Prophet was a Palestinian\u201d. According to Islamic tradition, Mohammed was an Adnanite Arab from Arabia. They claim descent from Ishmael and Abraham. That means they aren\u2019t Canaanites. And a number of the Arab clans who make up the \u201cPalestinians\u201d do have their origins in Arabia. For a brief, shining moment, Abbas was telling the truth. Previously, Abbas had also claimed that Jesus was a Palestinian. If you\u2019re keeping track, that means the Palestinians are Canaanites, Arabs and Jews. That certainly covers a lot of historical bases. But we\u2019re just getting started. \u201cThe Bible says, in these words, that the Palestinians existed before Abraham,\u201d Abbas also insisted. The Bible doesn\u2019t say anything in \u201cthese words\u201d, but people took it to mean that he was claiming that the Palestinians were actually the Philistines. But then he took credit for the invention of the \u201cCanaanite-Palestinian alphabet more than 6,000 years ago.\u201d There\u2019s no such alphabet. The Palestinian Authority and Muslims in Israel use the Arabic alphabet which does have its extremely distant origins in the Phoenician Proto-Canaanite alphabet. But so does Greek, Latin and the letters you\u2019re reading now. Like most of the \u201cPalestinian\u201d leader\u2019s claims, it\u2019s nonsense. Within a few years, Abbas claimed that the \u201cPalestinians\u201d are descended from the Canaanites, the Philistines, the Jews and the Arabs. Only the last one is true. The \u201cPalestinians\u201d were part of a wave of Arab and Islamic invaders whose incursions continued well into the modern era. There are some 10,000 \u201cAfro-Palestinians\u201d in Gaza. Some are African settlers who came in the 19th century. The anti-Israel left would have you believe that a Sudanese Muslim who settled in Israel in the late 19th century is an indigenous \u201cPalestinian\u201d, but a Jewish refugee from Egypt is a foreign \u201csettler\u201d.\n\nContinued below... The \u201cPalestinians\u201d are what they always were: a foreign Islamic Arab colony inside Israel The Arab Muslims who live in \u201948 and \u201967 Israel are made up of various clans from around the region. Abbas has referred to Jordan and Palestine as \u201cone people living in two states.\u201d Hamas interior minister Fathi Hammad had once asserted, \u201cPersonally, half my family is Egyptian. We are all like that. More than 30 families in the Gaza Strip are called Al-Masri (Egyptian). Brothers, half of the Palestinians are Egyptians and the other half are Saudis.\u201d The most famous Al-Masri is a billionaire who lives in a West Bank reproduction of an Italian villa named \u201cThe House of Palestine\u201d, and was recently detained by the Saudis. Munib Masri served as a Palestinian Authority minister, holds a legislative seat and accounts for a quarter of the \u201cPalestinian\u201d economy. The greenhouse in his villa was a gift from Napoleon III to his mistress. Masri, whose family name originated in Egypt, and claims to be a Palestinian, is actually a Saudi citizen who lives in an imported Italian villa. He made his money supplying the US military during Desert Storm. That\u2019s what a \u201cPalestinian\u201d looks like. The \u201cPalestinians\u201d are Egyptians, Saudis, Jordanians, Senegalese, Sudanese and a number of other Muslim invasive colonists. They are not Philistines, Canaanites or Jews. They\u2019re as indigenous as Al-Masri\u2019s \u201cHouse of Palestine\u201d made out of imported Italian marble and filled with European art. The \u201cPalestinians\u201d are what they always were: a foreign Islamic Arab colony inside Israel.\n\nContinued below... News from idealmedia.com The \u201cPalestinians\u201d are not the victims of colonialism. They are its perpetrators The Big Lie of Palestine is that the Islamic colonists are the indigenous population of Israel and that the Jews are colonizing Palestine. But an indigenous people can never colonize their own country. \u201cPalestine\u201d is a twisted colonial fiction. The name reflects Greek colonization of the region. And its use by the modern Islamic colonists shows their lack of any actual historical connection to Israel. After all the agonized wailing about the deeply meaningful \u201cPalestinian\u201d connection to \u201cPalestine\u201d, they still haven\u2019t come up with their own name for the place. One that they can properly pronounce. (There\u2019s no proper \u201cP\u201d in Arabic.) But Abbas keeps coming up with new lies about which ancient people the \u201cPalestinians\u201d are descended from this week. I can\u2019t wait until he claims to be Cherokee. The claim of the \u201cPalestinian\u201d colonists to Israel is a lie of Islamic imperialism. The Muslim powers of the region have funded the racist attacks by the PLO, Hamas and other Islamic terrorist groups on Jews. The \u201cPalestinians\u201d are not the victims of colonialism. They are its perpetrators. The fighting between Israel and Islamic terrorists is a struggle between imperialism and colonialism. The imperialists are not the oppressed Jewish minority that has been forced out of nearly everywhere else in the region. It\u2019s the Arab Islamic majority that represses minorities across the region. \u201cPalestine\u201d is a pathetic attempt to launder one imperial identity with another followed by shameless efforts to appropriate the identities of nearly every ancient people in the region. Including the Jews. The only way to end the conflict is to end the lies.", "domain": "canadafreepress.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://canadafreepress.com/print_friendly/the-big-palestine-lie"}

He is a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center and his articles appears at its Front Page Magazine site.\n\nMost Recent Articles by Daniel Greenfield:\n\nJan 24, 2018 \u2014 Daniel Greenfield\n\n\n\nPalestinian boss Mahmoud Abbas recently declared that Israel is \u201ca colonial enterprise that has nothing to do with Jewishness\u201d. Moses, King David and thousands of years of Jewish history would disagree. Israel and the Jews are part of the story of human civilization. Over 50% of the human race has a holy book that tells of the Jewish journey to Israel. That includes Mohammed\u2019s own copy of the Koran.\n\nIsrael isn\u2019t a \u201ccolonial enterprise\u201d. Palestine is.\n\nAnyone who wants to find out where the name Israel comes from can open the Book of Genesis 32:29. The story even appears in Islamic hadiths. But where does \u201cPalestine\u201d really come from?\n\nJan 21, 2018 \u2014 Daniel Greenfield\n\n\n\nThere are two statistics that explain the Democrat obsession with illegal immigration and open borders.\n\n97% of immigrants in the appropriate grouping identify themselves as Hispanic, but by the fourth generation that number falls to half. Only 7% of immigrants describe themselves as Americans, but 56% in the third generation call themselves Americans. Even the use of Spanish is slowly declining.\n\nIf a minority stops existing after a few generations, did it ever actually exist?\n\nJan 19, 2018 \u2014 Daniel Greenfield\n\n\n\nLast winter, the local media was touting Imam Abdullah Khadra as a victim of President Trump\u2019s travel ban. Khadra, a Syrian, was here on a religious worker visa and was applying for political asylum.\n\nThe refugee Imam living in North Carolina called Trump\u2019s move, \u201cabsolutely inhumane and ridiculous.\u201d\n\nJewish leftists agreed. Lucy Dinner, the clergywoman from Temple Beth Or in Raleigh, denounced \u201csingling out an entire group of people based on their faith.\u201d Lucy Dinner had previously signed a letter in support of anti-Israel activism by Eric and Jennifer Solomon. Eric Solomon was affiliated with the anti-Israel hate group, T\u2019ruah, and Jenny Solomon ran controversial educational programs at the NC Hillel.\n\nJan 18, 2018 \u2014 Daniel Greenfield\n\n\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s end year remarks to the New York Times acerbically summed up his relationship with the media. \u201cI\u2019m going to win another four years\u2026 because newspapers, television, all forms of media will tank if I\u2019m not there.\u201d The answering outburst of rage and contempt from the media burned all the hotter because the statement was not only intentionally provocative; it was also true.\n\nThe media has never been able to quit Trump. Its conviction that it can destroy him through coverage has repeatedly proven false. But that hasn\u2019t stopped the media from throwing more coverage at him. And its motive for the non-stop coverage has always been the selfish pursuit of ratings, clicks and sales.\n\nJan 14, 2018 \u2014 Daniel Greenfield\n\n\n\n(I wrote this article quite a few years ago. I feel that it\u2019s relevant now in light of the Oprah for President movement.)\n\nObama\u2019s political success was built on his ability to invoke values detached from belief systems. To break away symbols and ideals from religious and national value systems, and mix and match them into his own sound bites. Like the famous Hope poster, that mixed patriotic color schemes with socialist realism, or his own speeches which invoked the Founders in support of socialism.\n\nThe Obama wave was piggybacking on a culture where context had ceased to matter. Obama\u2019s image had more in common with the way hip hop artists sample songs, than with a symphony. His campaign was the perfect trailer to a movie that would never be released. It was the marriage of corporate advertising campaigns, pop culture, radical politics and Americana\u2014thrown together in a pot and boiled into one indecipherable mix that was appealing, and yet completely void of meaning.\n\nJan 13, 2018 \u2014 Daniel Greenfield\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re in the middle of a civil war.\n\nIt may not be a shooting war. For the most part. (Though don\u2019t tell that to some Republicans at a charity game practice who were targeted by a Bernie Sanders supporter.) But it\u2019s a war all the same.\n\nThe war is still being fought with paper and protests. But it\u2019s based on irreconcilable differences between parts of the country. Much like the ones that brought on the war between brothers.\n\nJan 12, 2018 \u2014 Daniel Greenfield\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Thatcher once famously observed that socialists \u201calways run out of other people\u2019s money.\u201d But what actually happens when socialism runs out of money?\n\nVenezuela, a once wealthy nation with black gold coming out of the ground, is a test case.\n\nThe socialist regime ran out of other people\u2019s money, and then out of money, years ago. The government met protests by its starving population with a 40% minimum wage hike. That\u2019s the usual socialist solution to what leftists call \u2018income inequality\u2019. The problem is that 40% of nothing is still zero.\n\nJan 10, 2018 \u2014 Daniel Greenfield\n\n\n\nIn October, 125 psychologists and assorted mental health professionals marched to New York\u2019s City Hall while wearing red tags warning, \u201cDANGER.\u201d Leading the march was Peter Fraenkel, author of Sync Your Relationship, Save Your Marriage, mournfully beating a drum in a solemn march. Fraenkel, a psychologist and \u201cprofessional drummer\u201d was able to combine his love of drums and hatred of Trump.\n\nThe \u2018Duty to Warn\u2019 march had begun at New York Law School where the experts demanded that Trump be removed from office based on their inability to understand the 25th Amendment. And then the mental health experts marched to the beat of Fraenkel\u2019s drum in what they insisted was a \u201cfunereal and dignified\u201d procession.\n\n\u201cPlease wear professional attire or dark clothing,\u201d the mental health experts were instructed. \u201cThere will be a slow drum beat, \u2018DANGER\u2019 tape, and flashing warning lights.\u201d\n\nJan 8, 2018 \u2014 Daniel Greenfield\n\n\u201cWe pay the Palestinians HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect,\u201d President Trump tweeted. \u201cWith the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?\u201d\n\nThe President of the United States has a very good point. But it\u2019s not as if the Islamic terrorists in the West Bank and Gazan territories of Israel have ever been willing to do more than occasionally talk peace before getting bored and stomping away from the table. And then stabbing a few children to death.\n\nThe United States has paid the PLO\u2019s Palestinian Authority billions to occasionally pretend to talk about peace. There isn\u2019t a dollar amount high enough to get the terrorists to actually agree to peace.\n\nJan 3, 2018 \u2014 Daniel Greenfield\n\n\n\nThe original civil war was fought by farmhands and factory workers, freed slaves and young boys turned soldiers; the new civil war is being fought by lawyers in blue or gray suits not with bullets, but with bullet points.\n\nFrom the Mueller investigation to Federal judges declaring that President Trump doesn\u2019t have the right to control immigration policy or command the military, from political sabotage at the DOJ by Obama appointees like Sally Yates to Patagonia\u2019s lawsuit over national monuments, the cold civil war set off by the left\u2019s rejection of the 2016 election results has been a paper war largely waged by lawyers.\n\n\u201cThe biggest threat to New Yorkers right now is the federal government,\u201d Attorney General Eric Schneiderman of New York recently declared. The radical leftist pol who had once vowed to do everything possible to elect Hillary Clinton was explaining his hundred lawsuits against the government on everything from net neutrality to the travel ban meant to keep out the Islamic terrorists running over tourists near Ground Zero and bombing commuters in the tunnels off Times Square.\n\nJan 2, 2018 \u2014 Daniel Greenfield\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher famously observed that socialism works until you run out of other people\u2019s money. Identity politics also works until you run out of other people.\n\nAnd then #MeToo becomes #NotMeToo.\n\nOther people\u2019s money can be borrowed against. That\u2019s why we have the national debt that we do. But identity politics has multiplied too abruptly and explosively to postpone the reckoning much longer. What were once simple categories of three races and two genders has mutated into an infinite alphabet of sexual identities, a Big Bang of ethnicities, national, cultural, racial and religious, each with its own microaggressions, that easily tops two hundred and shows no signs of slowing down its expansion.\n\nDec 30, 2017 \u2014 Daniel Greenfield\n\n\n\nSaleh Ali was one of 64,000 Syrian refugees living in the Netherlands. The vast majority, like Ali, are young men. And the largest number of these migrants spend their days idling in Amsterdam.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Saleh Ali took a walk to trendy Amstelveenseweg while wearing a keffiyah and waving a terrorist PLO flag. He stopped in front of a Jewish restaurant, shouted \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d and began smashing the windows. The Amsterdam police stood by and watched quizzically until he was done. Then when he entered the restaurant, they finally called him out and arrested him.\n\nAnd in two days he was back on the street.\n\nDec 27, 2017 \u2014 Daniel Greenfield\n\nYou might think that the biggest threat to New Yorkers is the string of Islamic terrorist attacks, including the recent Times Square suicide bombing and the Ground Zero adjacent Car Jihad. But New York\u2019s left-wing AG, who once vowed to give anti-Semitic lynch mob leader Al Sharpton a place in his office, knows better.\n\nSchneiderman remains undeterred in what he views as a significant role in protecting New Yorkers from Washington. \u201cWe try and protect New Yorkers from those who would do them harm,\u201d he told the Times. \u201cThe biggest threat to New Yorkers right now is the federal government, so we\u2019re responding to it.\u201d\n\nI love how in a brief matter of months, secessionist rhetoric has become so mainstreamed among Dems. The bosses of California and New York suddenly sound like militia leaders in Idaho.\u2014More\u2026\n\nDec 25, 2017 \u2014 Daniel Greenfield\n\n\n\n\u201cForemost,\u201d the NASA administrator described his marching orders from Obama, \u201che wanted me to find a way to reach out to the Muslim world.\u201d The great new mission of America\u2019s space agency would be to make Muslims \u201cfeel good about their historic contribution to science.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump has another mission for NASA.\n\nLooking over at former Senator Schmitt, the last living man to walk on the moon in the Apollo 17 mission forty-five years ago, President Trump said, \u201cToday, we pledge that he will not be the last.\u201d\n\nDec 21, 2017 \u2014 Daniel Greenfield\n\n\n\nAkayed Ullah, a Bangladeshi Muslim living in Brooklyn, really hated Christmas. He hated Christmas so much that he used Christmas tree lights (along with a battery and some wire) as a trigger for a pipe bomb. He filled the pipe bomb with screws so that when it went off, metal shrapnel would tear bloody holes through morning commuters in Manhattan.\n\nWearing a hooded jacket and a backpack to cover the pipe bomb strapped to his body, Ullah got on the F Train at the 18th Avenue elevated subway station off Little Bangladesh. Like the Duke Ellington song says, he switched over to the A Train at Jay Street. It was early morning, but there were plenty of people riding the train. Jay Street is a major transit hub. But Ullah was waiting to blow up somewhere else.\n\nHe got off in the crush at the 42nd-St. Port Authority station. Here a whole lot of people can be found rushing up and down crowded staircases and shoving their way through cramped corridors.\n\nDec 14, 2017 \u2014 Daniel Greenfield\n\nAmsterdam\u2019s HaCarmel restaurant sits between two other restaurants. The Jewish kosher eatery whose big blue sign boasts fish, meat and vegetarian options is sandwiched between a sidewalk caf\u00e9 with its inevitable Heineken umbrellas on one corner of Amstelveenseweg and an ice cream place on the other corner. There\u2019s an Italian restaurant across the street with some very nice front windows.\n\nIf the Muslim refugee had wanted to smash up any eatery, he had plenty of options. But he went to the Kosher restaurant. Inside were wooden chairs, white tablecloths and red roses. Outside came the guttural shriek of, \u201cAllahu Akbar.\u201d This was the battle cry with which Mohammed had inaugurated his massacre and enslavement of the Jews. The cuisine inside HaCarmel is Middle Eastern, but the attack showed why there are few Jews (or Christians) left in the Middle East outside Israel.\n\nThe Amsterdam cops had plenty of warning. The \u201cPalestinian\u201d was wearing a Keffiyah on his head, waving a large PLO flag in one hand and brandishing a club in the other while shouting, \u201cAllahu akbar.\u201d\n\nDec 12, 2017 \u2014 Daniel Greenfield\n\n\n\nHamas has announced that President Trump\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel has opened the \u201cgates of hell.\u201d Its Muslim Brotherhood parent has declared America an \u201cenemy state.\u201d\n\nThe Arab League boss warned that the Jerusalem move \u201cwill fuel extremism and result in violence.\u201d The Jordanian Foreign Minister claimed that it would \u201ctrigger anger\u201d and \u201cfuel tension.\u201d\n\n\u201cModerate\u201d Muslim leaders excel at threatening violence on behalf of the \u201cextremists\u201d.\n\nDec 9, 2017 \u2014 Daniel Greenfield\n\n\n\n\u201cEverybody f____g knew,\u201d a top Hollywood screenwriter wrote of Harvey Weinstein. \u201cEverybody knew\u201d about Matt Lauer at NBC, Variety reports, and it \u201cwasn\u2019t even considered a secret.\u201d \u201cEvery female in the press corps knew that, right, don\u2019t get in elevator with him,\u201d ABC\u2019s Cokie Roberts said of Rep. Conyers.\n\nEverybody knew.\n\nThe #MeToo sexual harassment scandals have hit CNN, MSNBC, CBS, NBC, ABC, NPR, PBS, Vox, New Republic, Mother Jones. Forget Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose. They were just the talent. Their big decisions were limited to which hairpiece looked best in all three mirrors and which na\u00efve intern to prey on this month. The heads of the men who actually make the news are rolling left and right.\n\nDec 6, 2017 \u2014 Daniel Greenfield\n\n\n\nHuma \u201cAbedin did not know that Clinton had a private server until about a year and a half ago when it became public knowledge.\u201d\n\nAbedin, Hillary\u2019s closest aide, was being interviewed at the FBI\u2019s Washington D.C. field office by two unnamed agents. Also present was Peter Strzok, the counterintelligence FBI figure embroiled in a scandal because of the pro-Hillary and anti-Trump texts exposed by his extramarital affair.\n\nThe field office is another one of those bland government buildings located near enough to the Mall for tourists who are going the wrong way to stumble on it, but not interesting enough for them to notice it. The building, like so many others, is part of the deeper architecture of the governing city that matters far more than the showy museums or even the White House and its adjacent Eisenhower Executive Office Building. The decisions that make the news happen in the White House and the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. But the decisions that really matter take place in more obscure places, like a bland government building.\n\nDec 5, 2017 \u2014 Daniel Greenfield\n\nIf we had anything faintly resembling an evenhanded justice system, Huma Abedin would be pleading guilty right about now. But of course we don\u2019t. And so a series of Trump associates are forced to plead guilty to lying to the FBI. While Hillary continues her Spite Across America tour. Did close Hillary associates like Cheryl Mills, Hillary\u2019s right-hand woman, and Huma Abedin lie to the FBI?\n\nAs evidence assembled by Chuck Ross at the Daily Caller suggests, it rather looks like it.\u2014More\u2026", "domain": "canadafreepress.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://canadafreepress.com/members/1/DanielGreenfield/90"}

Today it is estimated that this multi-billion dollar \u2018industry\u2019 is responsible for the enslavement and exploitation of approximately 20.9 million people around the world.\n\nDespite the fact that this is a massive problem, affecting both men and women young and old, many of us are still unaware of the depth of the problem that we are facing in today\u2019s society.\n\nThe term \u2018human trafficking\u2019 is often associated solely with sex slavery, however, that is only one of a number of situations that would fall under this umbrella. The Department of Homeland Security explains that human trafficking is \u201cmodern-day slavery and involves the use of force, fraud, or coercion to obtain some type of labor or commercial sex act.\u201d By this definition, human trafficking would include a young woman forced into prostitution, a child forced into unpaid labor or a man working at a commercial farming operation after his \u2018employer\u2019 stripped him of his passport, leaving him with no other recourse.\n\nIn recent history, world leaders have reaffirmed their dedication to cracking down on traffickers. Government leaders in the United Kingdom have developed plans to crackdown on the high rate of human trafficking in Nigeria, committing nearly $9.5 million USD to eradicate the problem at the root. Meanwhile, Egyptian law enforcement started 2018 with the detention of 75 people following a 14-month investigation by the Administrative Control Authority. The arrests included government officials, Egyptian citizens and foreigners.\n\nThe Egyptian raids raise an important point in the consideration of human trafficking cases \u2013 those involved are not always low-level criminals. In fact, many of those that have been arrested in association with these crimes are high-profile, professional individuals, government officials and business owners. There have been rumors that additional high-level arrests have been made, and media sources in the United States are even being given access to the information at this time in preparation for the story going public, however, U.S. officials are keeping quiet at this time so as to avoid the release of information that could harm their efforts or hinder the capture of those responsible.\n\nWithin the United States, individual state officials have been making advances in their efforts to crack down on this heinous crime. Recently state lawmakers in Wisconsin have expanded upon their existing laws following 82 arrests as part of a nationwide sting. The new proposed laws would expand upon the ability to subpoena internet providers for records by also allowing hotel internet records to be collected including the customer\u2019s name, address, phone number and the duration of their stay. Matt Joy, Director of the Human Trafficking Bureau and Internet Crimes against Children Task Force with the Wisconsin Department of Justice explains, \u201cWe started recognizing, as we built our human trafficking capacities over the last year, that this tool could be a great benefit to those who are engaged in human trafficking investigations.\u201d\n\nJanuary 2018 has officially been declared as \u2018National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month\u2019 by President Donald Trump. The official statement on the White House website states:\n\n\u201cDuring National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, we recommit ourselves to eradicating the evil of enslavement. Human trafficking is a modern form of the oldest and most barbaric type of exploitation. It has no place in our world. This month we do not simply reflect on this appalling reality. We also pledge to do all in our power to end the horrific practice of human trafficking that plagues innocent victims around the world.\u201d\n\n\ufeff\n\nImage via Odyssey", "domain": "awarenessact.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://awarenessact.com/rumors-circulate-that-high-level-arrests-have-begun-in-the-crackdown-on-human-trafficking/"}

It stayed all day on Sunday and began melting at around 5 pm.\u201d While children made snowmen and snow angels and took their makeshift sleds to ride down the dunes, Bouchetata, along with numerous other photographers, took out their cameras to capture the rare beauty.\n\nCheck out these stunning photos, straight from the Sahara Desert:", "domain": "awarenessact.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://awarenessact.com/for-the-second-time-in-over-30-years-snow-fell-in-the-sahara-desert/"}

Reflect over your past.\n\nReally think things over. Think about your past and where you want to be in the future. Really figure out what is holding you back.\n\nAccept your past as your past, and really try to stop giving it power. The more power you give it the worse it will feel.\n\n3. Get out in nature.\n\nSpend as much time in nature as you can. Get out there and feel the dirt. Let your feelings flow, cry if you need to cry.\n\n4. Take about it.\n\nTalk about things with someone who matters to you. Let things out and share the burden with someone who cares. This feeling will bring about so much peace.\n\n5. Believe in yourself.\n\nBelieve in who you are and who you can be. Stop letting your past define you! Accept yourself and your future self.\n\nBe more present, stop dwelling on the past. The past is not who you are. Be as in the moment as you can be.\n\nIf you cannot change it let go of it. There is no sense in holding onto something that serves no purpose in your life.

The home was registered as a homeschool.\n\n\"The lack of oversight of home schools is what allows people to hide abuse,\" Kathryn Brightbill, legislative policy analyst for the coalition told The Press-Enterprise. \"We believe that the various states should introduce legislation to have annual contact with mandated reporters.\"\n\nAnd a statement from the Board of Directors of the HomeSchool Association of California said they anticipate new legislation is on the horizon.\n\n\"We know that many homeschooling families are feeling nervous due to the recent abuse case which has been in the news,\" the directors said. \"We do suspect legislation may be forthcoming that might try to regulate private homeschoolers. We do not know what form that proposed legislation will take and it is a complicated endeavor that is likely to take some time. We assure you that HSC will have a hand in fighting or helping to define any bills that are proposed.\"\n\nIn an earlier statement, Debbie Schwarzer, the organization's legal team co-chair dismissed the idea of an annual inspection requirement for homeschooled children.\n\n\"I've seen articles that suggest that private homeschoolers should be required to present their children for an annual inspection by teachers and a doctor. It's an outrageous suggestion, one that amounts to suspecting all homeschooling parents of being unfit, of being capable of crimes against their children,\" Schwarzer wrote.\n\n\"Obviously the overwhelming majority of parents who choose to homeschool their children do so with the best interests of their children as their top priority. They should not be subjected to suspicion by the state and gross invasion of their privacy through unwarranted intrusion into their lives. The state and society should give them the same benefit of the doubt that all parents are given, of acting in their children's best interests until specific facts or circumstances suggest otherwise,\" she added.\n\nData cited by the Coalition for Responsible Home Education argues there is very little accountability for homeschooling parents across the nation.\n\nSome 11 states do not require parents to provide notice of homeschooling, 14 states do not require parents to provide instruction in any specific subject, 25 states do not require any form of academic assessments, parents in 39 states are not required to have a high school diploma, GED, or other qualifications and 48 states have no protections for at-risk homeschooled children.\n\n\"The current lack of accountability or oversight of homeschooling has negative consequences for thousands of homeschooled children. In some cases homeschooling serves to hide abuse, and in other cases parents shortchange their children educationally,\" the organization said.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Education, there were an estimated 1.8 million homeschooled students in the United States in 2012. This number showed an increase from 850,000 in 1999, when estimates were first reported.\n\nCalifornia law requires all children between 6 and 18 to be enrolled in public school unless their parents opt to make them attend a \"full-time, private day school\" or learn from a private tutor with a valid California teaching certificate, according to The Press Enterprise.\n\nAnyone who homeschools at least six students, like the Turpin family must file to form their own \"private school.\" The Turpins registered their home as a private school named Sandcastle Day School whose only students were their children.\n\nAuthorities who rescued the Christian couple's children said they had very little knowledge of the outside world and were poorly homeschooled.\n\nLast Thursday, David and Louise Turpin were charged with 12 criminal counts of torture, seven counts of abuse of a dependent adult, and 12 counts of false imprisonment that could keep them behind bars for life if they are convicted. David Turpin also faces one count of committing a lewd act by force or fear.

According to the British Asian Christian Association, one of Devi's uncles told a local newspaper that \"she could not have willingly quit her Hindu faith.\"\n\nBut BACA reported that Devi had become a Christian over two years ago, years after her husband converted to Christianity. She became sick just days after their marriage but was healed during a church service, BACA said. Two years later, however, the illness returned and she died on Jan. 15.\n\nWhen Kumar brought her body from Punjab state to Jammu and Kashmir to be buried, news of the burial spread and incited violence.\n\nHindu fanatics from extremist group Bajran Dal and a mob of over 300 people sought revenge the next day by smashing Sehal Christ Church and setting it on fire. Christians attending the church for prayer were beaten, with 12 seriously injured. Businesses that were owned by Christians were also damaged.\n\nMoreover, the mob exhumed the body of Devi and burned it, as part of a Hindu ritual, BACA reported.\n\nDevi's uncle, Joginder Singh, told UCANews that they were not aware Devi's husband was a Christian and that they found out about it last month \"when she told us over the phone that her husband took her to Christmas prayers at a church in Punjab. He must have coerced her to convert to Christianity.\"\n\nKumar was severely beaten and arrested, along with seven other Christians, by local police. None of the Hindus involved in the mob violence were arrested.\n\nWilliam Masih, a local Christian, told BACA that during the violence, local police just stood by and watched and that Christians, who are already marginalized, have become more fearful.\n\nState lawmaker Sheikh Abdul Rasheed has called for the arrest of the people who burned down Christian property, and decried the persecution of minorities across the country.\n\nAccording to BACA, the pastor of the church that was burned down has gone into hiding and Christians from that church are being forcibly reconverted back to Hinduism.\n\nWilson Chowdhry, chairman of the British Asian Christian Association, said in a statement, \"This attack on innocent Christians highlights the increasing hatred towards non-Hindus in an India that has become increasingly polarized under the Narendra Modi regime.\n\n\"Attacks on Christians are increasing with intensity and frequency and rarely result in convictions for the perpetrators.\"\n\nWhile few incidents of Christian persecution are reported from the state of Jammu and Kashmir, the incidence of attacks on Christians is alarmingly high in several other parts of the country. False allegations on Christians are also common across the country.\n\nChristian persecution has steeply risen since the Hindu rightwing Bharatiya Janata Party won the general election in 2014.\n\nThe first quarter of 2017 saw 248 incidents of persecution, and by the end of June, the number grew to 410, compared to a total of 441 incidents reported in all of 2016, a recent report by Open Doors revealed.\n\n\"When the Christians are beaten by the extremists, they receive injuries mostly on their heads or their vital body parts,\" a local partner of Open Doors said in the report. \"The assaulters do not care if the person dies in the attack. They know that they will not be punished because the government (and hence the judiciary) will take their side. In most of the cases the assaulters go unpunished.\"\n\nThe governing party in India is connected with a Hindu nationalist organization, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, whose founder, M.S. Golwalkar, has said: \"The non-Hindu people in Hindustan (referring to India) must either adopt the Hindu culture and language, must learn to respect and revere Hindu religion, must entertain no idea but the glorification of the Hindu religion, that is they must not only give up their attitude of intolerance and ingratitude toward this land and its age-long tradition but must also cultivate the positive attitude of love and devotion instead; in one word they must cease to be foreigners or may stay in the country wholly subordinated to the Hindu nation claiming nothing, deserving no privileges, far less any preferential treatment not even citizen's rights.\"", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/hindus-burn-down-church-in-india-alleging-forced-conversion-214611/"}

And followers of Jesus must be especially watchful that American national identity does not trump their identity in Christ, he says.\n\nAt Evangelicals for Life 2018 held at the JW Marriott hotel last week, World Vision President Richard Stearns sat down with The Christian Post for an interview about the importance of valuing life at every stage, a recurring theme throughout the two-day conference that coincided with the March for Life, the largest annual pro-life gathering in the nation.\n\n\"Some of the same people that value the unborn as precious lives don't want refugees to seek asylum in our country or may want to build a wall to keep out immigrants that might come across illegally,\" Stearns lamented.\n\nPeople tend to put different price tags on different lives and all of us tend to look at the world with our own filters and lenses and values systems, he continued. And although the phrase \"consistently pro-life\" has become clich\u00e9 \"you can't just value the unborn, you have to value the elderly, you have to value the immigrant, you have to value the disabled, you have to value people you don't agree with, people of other religions,\" he said.\n\n\"The most powerful witness Christians have for the truth of the Gospel is unconditional love, especially for the least of these, the widow, the orphan, the stranger.\"\n\nWhen Christians love the unlovable unconditionally and sacrificially, \"the world steps back and takes notice and says 'Wow, who are these people? How do we explain their unconditional love? They are doing things that we would never expect them to do and they value life.'\"\n\nStearns further expressed concern the current political climate, urging Christians to resist the temptation to pledge unquestioning allegiance to a particular party or movement.\n\n\"Here's what I think is happening in our culture, our identity as Americans, our national identity, is trumping our religious identity,\" he said. \"But our identity in Christ should be at the very, very top of our value system and it should inform everything else.\"\n\n\"God does not put a price tag on Americans and say they are worth more than Syrians. We're the ones that are doing that. We are the ones that are playing with the price tags. And I think we have mixed up our national identity and our politics with our faith to a point where some can no longer tell the difference between all of those domains in their life.\"\n\nThe World Vision president noted that lately he has taken to saying that far too often people, whether their views lean to the right or left, spend too much time considering what is politically correct when they ought to be concerned about being biblically correct.\n\n\"If we're biblically correct about refugees we would see God loves those refugees. These are people in desperate situations, that have lost loved ones, have fled their homes, that have nothing. These are the people Jesus talked about when He spoke 'For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink,\" Stearns said, citing Matthew 25:35.\n\n\"We should have no other response but to say, 'How can we help these people?'\"\n\nWhile it is important for Christians to be politically engaged, whenever the Church gets consumed with politics it sullies the Church, not the politicians, Stearns said.\n\nEarlier this month it was announced that Stearns will be retiring, having been the longest serving leader at World Vision in the organization's history. CP asked him what he is most proud of and heartened by during his tenure.\n\n\"Most of our constituents, our child sponsors, are surprised to hear that in the last 25 years more people have been lifted out of extreme poverty than at any time in history,\" he recounted.\n\nAn estimated 2.8 billion lacked access to clean water in 1990 and today it's less than 700 million, he noted. Likewise, maternal mortality in childbirth has been halved, world hunger has been reduced, adult literacy has climbed substantially.\n\n\"The world is changing in profound ways for the better and almost every indicator of poverty is going in the right direction.\"\n\nAnd these encouraging developments in the past few decades are bigger than putting a man on the moon and ought to be celebrated much more, he said.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/dont-let-political-identity-trump-your-identity-in-christ-world-vision-president-says-214689/"}

In Dec. 2016, the Larsens filed suit against a state law that would compel them to film same-sex wedding ceremonies despite their religious objections.\n\nA Christian couple who were told by Minnesota officials that they must film same-sex weddings despite their religious objections have appealed to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nCarl and Angel Larsen of Telescope Media Group appealed a lower court decision from last year which said they had to film same-sex weddings or face legal penalties.\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom, a conservative law firm representing the Larsens, filed an opening brief last Friday arguing that Minnesota law violates the couple's constitutional rights.\n\n\"The Larsens serve all people. They just cannot convey all messages. Because of their religious beliefs, they cannot celebrate any vision of marriage other than one between one man and one woman,\" read the brief.\n\nExpand | Collapse\n\n\"At the same time, the Larsens' faith requires them to use their talents to express messages that honor God. They want to do this by producing wedding films, publishing them online, and posting a statement explaining their religious views. But these plans are on hold because Minnesota will punish them if they post their statement or create wedding films consistent with their faith while declining to create wedding films promoting contrary views.\"\n\nADF Senior Counsel Jeremy Tedesco said in a statement released Monday that the state \"shouldn't threaten artists with fines and jail simply for living in accordance with their beliefs in the artistic marketplace.\"\n\n\"Americans should have the freedom to disagree on significant matters of conscience, which is why everyone, regardless of their view of marriage, should support the Larsens,\" added Tedesco.\n\n\"Government is supposed to be freedom's greatest protector, not its greatest threat. That's why we are asking the 8th Circuit to reverse the district court's decision.\"\n\nIn December 2016, the Larsens filed suit against the Minnesota Human Rights Act's ban on sexual orientation discrimination, stating that the measure would force them to film same-sex weddings.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge John Tunheim ruled against the Larsens last September, arguing, among other things, that the law is \"neutral\" in its application and does not force businesses to convey a government message.\n\nJudge Tunheim also concluded that while the law \"does incidentally require wedding videographers to make videos they might not want to make,\" these concerns are \"immaterial.\"\n\n\"First, speech-for-hire is commonly understood to reflect the views of the customer,\" wrote Tunheim. \"Thus, when a person views a wedding video, there is little danger that they would naturally attribute the video's messages to the videographer.\"\n\n\"Second, the Larsens can easily disclaim personal sponsorship of the messages depicted in the wedding videos they create for clients. For example, the Larsens could post language on their website stating that while they follow applicable law, and thus serve couples regardless of protected status, they are opposed to same-sex marriage.\"", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/christian-filmmakers-ask-appeals-court-to-stop-minnesota-from-forcing-them-to-film-gay-weddings-214833/"}

Shortly after Litzinger stepped down, the mother learned that she was not the only victim of the unwanted advances and more than a dozen women had similar stories to share.\n\nDoe charged in the lawsuit that Litzinger exploited his position as lead pastor to \"cultivate an atmosphere within Church for Life, through which he could satisfy his sexual fetishes.\"\n\nIn pre-marital classes, she alleged that the pastor would try and \"prepare the young women for their husbands and their wedding night,\" advising the women on how to masturbate, have an orgasm and explore their bodies, in order to be \"prepared and willing to do whatever their husbands wanted.\"\n\nHe would also share photos with Doe of himself and Cindy, covered in bed, with a note saying \"just had a great session\" and urged her to be similarly open with him about her sex life.

I believe that God was giving us a second chance. We\u2019ve been given a second chance, and Christians, we\u2019ve got to stand up and we\u2019ve got to get it right.\u201d\n\nGraham, son of 98-year-old retired evangelist Billy Graham, said in December he didn\u2019t believe it was the Russians who intervened in Trump\u2019s election but God.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any scientific information,\u201d Graham reportedly told a crowd at Trump\u2019s final \u201cthank you\u201d rally in Mobile, Ala. \u201cI don\u2019t have a stack of emails to read to you, but I have an opinion: I believe it was God. God showed up. He answered the prayers of hundreds of thousands of people across this land who had been praying for this country.\u201d\n\nGraham recently came under criticism for defending President Trump\u2019s executive order barring citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States for 90 days and suspending the admission of all refugees for 120 days subsequently blocked by federal courts.\n\nThe Baptist Churches of Puerto Rico responded by withdrawing endorsement for Graham\u2019s Feb. 10-12 Festival of Hope evangelistic rally in San Juan, terming the preacher\u2019s endorsement of Trump\u2019s anti-immigration stance \u201ccontrary to the values of the Kingdom.\u201d\n\nGraham continued to defend the Trump travel ban on social media, posting Feb. 11 on Facebook that as head of a humanitarian organization working in more than 100 countries, including most on the banned list, \u201cI feel I have something to say about this issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are working to help thousands of refugees every day in different countries,\u201d Graham described the work of Samaritan\u2019s Purse. \u201cLike the Good Samaritan Jesus told about in the Bible, we help those who have been hurt along life\u2019s road. But that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t need to make the borders of our own country secure.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be na\u00efve,\u201d Graham said. \u201cJust because we give medical care to ISIS fighters doesn\u2019t mean I would want to allow any one of them to immigrate to the United States. That would be crazy.\u201d\n\nGraham said taking time to vet who is being allowed to enter America isn\u2019t too much to ask.\n\n\u201cWe need to know who they are,\u201d he said. \u201cGod does tell us to help the stranger and those in need; but God doesn\u2019t tell us to expose our cities, homes and lives to hostile people.\u201d\n\nStarnes began his journalistic career in newspapers. In 2000 he landed a job as staff writer for Baptist Press and later moved to assistant editor.\n\nBaptist Press fired him in 2003 after he interviewed Secretary of Education Rod Paige and quoted him as saying he personally preferred private Christian education over public schools. After a controversy that nearly cost the secretary his job, Paige claimed that Starnes quoted him out of context.\n\nSeven years later his former employer welcomed Starnes back as keynote speaker at the 2010 Baptist Press Collegiate Journalism Conference.\n\nAfter leaving Baptist Press Starnes turned briefly to public relations as director of university communications at Baptist-affiliated Union University in Jackson, Tenn. He switched to radio, moving to California before eventually landing in New York as overnight anchor for Fox News Radio.\n\nToday Starnes is heard daily on hundreds of radio stations around the nation. He writes a column, hosts a digital show for FoxNews.com and appears regularly on Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network.\n\nStarnes describes himself as \u201ca gun toting, chicken eating son of a Baptist\u201d with a penchant for finding stories about conservative Christians who feel discriminated against in America\u2019s culture wars.\n\nCritics attribute his appeal to Fox\u2019s key demographic of older, white Christian conservatives to his use of over-the-top rhetoric and indifference toward checking the facts in his stories.\n\nPrevious stories:\n\nBaptists withdraw support for Franklin Graham rally in Puerto Rico\n\nFranklin Graham says God uses \u2018extreme vetting,\u2019 welcomes confirmation of attorney general", "domain": "baptistnews.com", "label": 0, "url": "https://baptistnews.com/article/fox-pundit-credits-god-franklin-graham-for-electing-trump/"}

Two of the letter signers identify as CBWC pastors. One of them, Pastor Tim Dickau of Grandview Calvary Baptist Church, signed a previous open letter last summer criticizing Graham as \u201ca polarizing figure\u201d whose \u201cungracious and bigoted remarks have the potential to generate serious negative impact on the Christian witness in Vancouver.\u201d\n\nThe religious leaders said they worked behind the scenes for nine months hoping to persuade the planning committee for the March 3-5 Festival of Hope to find a more suitable speaker. They intended to release their letter Feb. 21 but agreed to postpone it to give Graham time to reply in writing.\n\nThey said Graham responded Feb. 23, promising to avoid controversial statements while in Vancouver but not retracting harmful comments made in the past. They encouraged Graham to also release his reply to the public.\n\nThe faith leaders said they bear no ill will toward the Festival of Hope committee but \u201csimply believe it is a mistake to think Franklin Graham\u2019s political stances are immaterial to his presenting the gospel.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month leaders in the Baptist Churches of Puerto Rico withdrew their support for Graham\u2019s Feb. 10-12 Festival of Hope evangelistic rally in San Juan, terming Graham\u2019s endorsement of Trump\u2019s immigration policies \u201ccontrary to the values of the Kingdom.\u201d\n\nGraham shows no sign of toning down his political views. On Feb. 27 he commented on Facebook about a news story on George W. Bush\u2019s daughter Barbara planning to speak at a fundraiser for Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood is the #1 abortion provider in the United States,\u201d Graham said. \u201cRaising funds for this organization is like raising money to fund a Nazi death camp \u2014 like Auschwitz, except for innocent babies in their mother\u2019s wombs! Reports say they perform over 300,000 abortions per year. And this is the organization whose employees were caught on video trying to sell baby body parts over wine.

As of 2011 the region numbered 112 churches with more than 25,000 members.\n\nThe region\u2019s leaders said they do not intend to undermine the Festival of Hope but issued their statement in order \u201cto affirm our testimony in favor of the poor, marginalized and foreigners, among others.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet us continue in prayer so that the gospel of Jesus can be proclaimed and lived in all our earth,\u201d the Baptist leaders said.\n\nIt isn\u2019t the first time that Graham\u2019s outspoken views on controversial issues such as homosexuality, Islam and immigration have caused a stumbling block for an evangelistic event. Last fall five pastors in Canada \u2014 two of them Baptists \u2014 said publicly they would not be supporting Graham\u2019s March 2017 Festival of Hope crusade in Vancouver, labeling him a poor witness for the gospel.\n\nIn addition to his role with the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, Graham runs Samaritan\u2019s Purse, an international relief agency with programs including Operation Christmas Child, an annual event that recruits volunteers in churches and other organizations to fill shoeboxes with Christmas gifts for impoverished children in more than 150 countries and territories around the world.\n\nA Baptist News Global columnist recently suggested moderate Baptist churches that participate in Operation Christmas Child unwittingly give Graham a platform to spout his political views.\n\n\u201cDo you really want to send a dose of hatred along with that shoebox of Christmas trinkets?\u201d Mark Wingfield, associate pastor of Wilshire Baptist Church in Dallas, wrote Jan. 28. \u201cDoes handing out Christmas gifts counterbalance Graham\u2019s declaration that many of those who receive them would not be welcome in America?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are other \u2014 and better \u2014 ways to support refugees and children in need around the world,\u201d said Wingfield, a member of the Baptist News Global board of directors. \u201cIn reality, sending a shoebox of odds and ends is less effective than providing food and clothing and shelter and education.\n\n\u201cIf you are outraged by Franklin Graham\u2019s misrepresentation of Christian doctrine, channel your support somewhere else, like World Vision or any of the reputable denomination-based relief agencies,\u201d Wingfield said.\n\nThe Charlotte Observer reported in 2015 that between his two jobs Graham received compensation totaling more than $880,000 in 2013. That made him the highest-paid CEO of any international relief agency based in the United States, but it was less than the $1.2 million he received in 2008.\n\nLast year the IRS reclassified the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association as an \u201cassociation of churches\u201d so that the charity is no longer required to file a financial disclosure form that includes top salaries of executives. The sister organization Samaritan\u2019s Purse also requested reclassification for the same reasons but reportedly did not receive an immediate response.\n\nPrevious stories:\n\nPastors oppose Franklin Graham crusade in Canada\n\nBWA criticizes Muslim travel ban", "domain": "baptistnews.com", "label": 0, "url": "https://baptistnews.com/article/baptists-withdraw-support-for-franklin-graham-rally-in-puerto-rico/"}

Brown for an incredible 'Gospel Worship Experience' you do not want to miss!\"\n\nA post shared by Tye Tribbett (@bowtyetrib) on Jan 17, 2018 at 11:00am PST\n\nIn his Instagram video, Tribbett said TBN would be airing the gospel music show after other networks canceled theirs. Last year, Tribbett's BET gospel music variety show \"Joyful Noise\" was canceled after just one season.\n\n\"While other networks are taking gospel and worship off of their networks we're partnering with TBN to keep worship alive and well on mainstream mediums. The first taping is Jan. 29 at the Holy Land in Orlando Florida,\" he said. \"Get here, it starts at 6 p.m. We got Kiki, Anthony Brown, Travis Greene, Tasha Cobbs Leonard. You do not want to miss this night of worship and praise to our living God.\"\n\nJust before he starred in \"Joyful Noise,\" Tribbett spoke to The Christian Post about his desire to make gospel music relevant.\n\n\"My thing was to really make Jesus, gospel and music as cool and relevant as it really is. I want to bring that back in a way that will bring family together, not just youth,\" the boisterous musician told CP in 2016. \"I want to bring families together so they will be inspired because we're going to face some dark days, especially in America. We're going to find strength in knowing all things work together for good, and I want the show to be a reinforcement of that truth.\"", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/tye-tribbett-is-teaming-up-tbn-new-gospel-music-show-214454/"}

Tebow is currently a part of New York Mets' Class A affiliate team, the Fireflies.\n\nThe former NFL quarterback played for the Mets' minor league system all of 2017, batting .226 with eight home runs and 52 RBIs in 126 games. He kicked off the season in Columbia, South Carolina, in the South Atlantic League but was promoted to the Florida State League to play for Class A St. Lucie in late June.\n\nThe 30-year-old came out the gate swinging when he first joined St. Lucie. He batted .317 over his first 25 games and had a 12-game hitting streak while playing outfield and as a designated hitter. According to ESPN, out of 93 qualified hitters in the South Atlantic League at the time, Tebow landed at No. 85 as was still promoted to high A ball.\n\nNow, the Mets inviting Tebow to big league camp once again guarantees that he will be in the lineup and actually play in the games for spring training.\n\nMany have criticized the Heisman Trophy winner's ability to play baseball, some even claiming that he only has a position in baseball because he can help sell t-shirts, jerseys and fill the stadium seats. However, Tebow continues to defy the odds by being an example for others who wish to live out their dreams.\n\nTebow has said that playing major league baseball has always been a childhood dream of his and although numbers like his wouldn't normally garner a major-league invite, his age has pushed the Mets to accelerate his progress.\n\nAt the 2017 SABR conference in New York last year, Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson told fans that they enjoy having Tebow a part of the Mets family.\n\n\"We signed him because he is a good guy, partly because of his celebrity, partly because this is an entertainment business,\" Alderson told attendees according to a report. \"My attitude is 'why not?'\"\n\nFireflies President John Katz told reporters during a press conference last season that Tebow has greatly impacted the clubhouse.\n\n\"His contributions, both on the field and in our community, have made a tremendous impact on our team, the City of Columbia and the entire South Atlantic League,\" Katz said. \"We wish Tim the best as he continues his journey to Citi Field.\"\n\nBecause of his celebrity status, Tebow helped push the Fireflies' average attendance up nearly 40 percent over a year ago. Tebow maintained that he's not thinking about the naysayers.\n\n\"It's not something that I have to answer,\" he said at that press conference. \"I just try to go out there and try to work.

Mueller III or his staff\u2026.\n\nA copy of all guidance memoranda and communications by which the Justice Management Division will review the Special Counsel\u2019s Office\u2019s \u201cStatement of Expenditures\u201d\u2026\n\nA copy of each document scoping, regulating, or governing the Special Counsel\u2019s Office appointed under the leadership of Mueller III\u2026\n\nThe Justice Department has thus far ignored Judicial Watch\u2019s requests for documents about its management of the Mueller operation.\n\nThe Justice Department also sent Judicial Watch a copy of a previously published document showing expenditures by the Special Counsel\u2019s Office from May 17, 2017, to September 30, 2017. The total was $3,213,695, nearly a million dollars per month.\n\nOn July 7, 2017, The Washington Post reported that Special counsel Mueller submitted a proposed budget to the Justice Department, \u201cbut officials declined to make the document public and committed only to releasing reports of the team\u2019s expenditures every six months.\u201d\n\nJudicial Watch is pursuing numerous additional FOIA lawsuits related to the surveillance, unmasking, and illegal leaking targeting President Trump and his associates during the FBI\u2019s investigation of potential Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\u201cSpecial Counsel Mueller\u2019s operation is not above the law. The American people have a right to know how much taxpayer money is planned for his massive investigation,\u201d said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. \u201cNo one else in DC seems to be providing oversight of the Mueller operation, so once again it is up to the citizen\u2019s group Judicial Watch to fight for accountability.\u201d\n\n\u2014More..", "domain": "canadafreepress.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://canadafreepress.com/print_friendly/judicial-watch-justice-department-refuses-to-release-muellers-budget-propos"}

Many individuals have been working towards reaching a level of spiritual awakening and enlightenment that will allow them to rise above the negativity and hate that exists in the world around us, however, this is a battle in going against the current, surrounded by the struggles and hurt of the masses.\n\nGood news \u2013 we have reached an incredible time, an opportunity for true ascension. This occurs during a phenomenon called an \u2018Event Horizon,\u2019 a time when the energy and light from the Galactic Central Sun and the energy from the core of the Earth, the heart of our planet, meet upon the planet\u2019s surface. This causes a big wave or flash \u2013 both of light and divine energy, spreading out across the planet reaching all living entities.\n\nTo better understand this, you must realize the difference between the sun as we know it, the provider of light and warmth on our planet, and the galactic central sun. A source of spiritual energy, the galactic central sun is an object located in the Sagittarius constellation.\n\nFrom a scientific stance, an event horizon can be defined as \u2018a boundary in spacetime beyond which events cannot affect an outside observer.\u2019 In other words, the event horizon is the \u2018point of no return.\u2019 From a spiritual perspective, the phenomenon is similar, this is a point in our spiritual existence at which you can no longer turn back, a line in the sand marking a significant shift. Those coming up to this shift cannot see it or life beyond it, however, and those who have been delivered through the ascension cannot return to their lives before it.\n\nAs this energy spreads across the planet it will bring with it great joy, love, and peace. Reaching into even the darkest of corners and forgotten places on the planet, it will drive out negativity and hate replacing it with its healing light. This is a major shift that has never before been seen here on Earth, one that will be felt by each and every one of us whether we believe in its existence or not. It\u2019s power, however, will be powered and intensified by the positivity of those of us here on the planet. For this reason, it is important that we understand it\u2019s full powers and prepare for it to come.\n\nThe early stages of spiritual ascension are not always comfortable, often involving symptoms such as headaches, body aches, and pains, bursts of energy and mood swings. This is the time in which your body, mind, and soul are working through the energy shift, adjusting to the new, higher frequencies. Try to remain patient with yourself and practice self-care, ensuring that you are getting enough rest to allow your body to work through this somewhat challenging time.\n\nIn order to help boost the positive reach of this phenomenon, we need to begin by practice regular ascension meditation. This may be as simple as a 30 min meditation daily, focusing on the overall betterment of humanity. This means envisioning true, unconditional love surrounding and embracing our planet, and everyone on it. For others, ascension meditation is slightly more structured, but still with the same end goal of welcoming, encouraging and empowering the positive energies that will bring humanity through the ascension process. The more that we share this message and band together, practicing regular ascension meditation and empowering the coming energies, the more incredible this shift will be for humanity.\n\nTry this guided ascension meditation:", "domain": "awarenessact.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://awarenessact.com/event-horizon-when-the-energy-and-light-from-the-galactic-central-sun-resonate-on-planet-earth/"}

Weighing, on average, a mere 3 pounds, the human brain acts as \u2018command central\u2019 for our entire bodies, determining how we act, react, how we feel, interpreting our senses and telling our muscles how to move and function. Containing approximately 100 billion neurons or nerve cells, it can process information as slowly as 0.5m/sec or as fast as 120m/sec, a feat that many of us take for granted!\n\nAs Brett Wingeier, Ph.D., an engineer, neuroscientists and the co-founder of Halo Neuroscience explains, \u201cyour brain is constantly working \u2013 to sense, process, think, move, and even dream.\u201d By understanding how the neurons connect, which electrical impulses carry messages to various organs in the body and which area of the brain is associated with our various senses we can begin to wrap our head around its incredible function, but what about the topics of intelligence, problem-solving and critical thinking skills?\n\nExperts say that you can actually strengthen your brain\u2019s function in a similar way to an athlete strengthening their muscles working out. By reading, doing puzzles and challenging our ability to solve various problems we can keep our brain active and working in its optimal condition. The internet is packed with amazing examples of critical thinking and problem-solving riddles, each pushing us to think outside the box and expand our mental capacity.\n\nHere are 22 incredible thought experiments to challenge your mind:\n\n#1 \u2013 Recently featured in an episode of Dr. Who, the Bootstrap Paradox was named after a time travel story written by Robert A. Heinlein called \u2018By His Bootstraps.\u2019 This poses the idea that if an object or piece of information is sent back it in time it will become trapped in an infinite loop, never actually having a noticeable origin.\n\nFor example, if the Doctor in Dr. Who goes back in time and gives a young Beethoven a copy of his famous Sonatas, and he publishes them, who actually composed these works?\n\n#2 \u2013 Roman poet and philosopher Titus Lucretius Carus posed the following question which continues to leave many scratching their heads today:\n\n\u201cIf atoms in our brain always act predictably, how can we have free will?\u201d\n\n#3 \u2013 Popularized by John Maynard Keynes, a renowned economist, the \u2018Paradox of Thrift\u2019 introduces an interesting and complex problem that underlies our current economic system. It proposes that during difficult economic times everyone should save their money as it is the responsible thing to do, avoiding spending on things that we do not need. However, if each of us starts saving all of our money and cutting our unnecessary spending then that will cause the aggregate demand to drop, and as the impact of that shift takes investments will give lower return and income will also decline meaning that we will, ultimately, have fewer savings.\n\n#4 \u2013 The following paradox was based on a true story. Known as the \u2018Paradox of the Court,\u2019 it tells the famous conundrum of Protagoras and his pupil Euathlus. Consider this one seriously and try applying it to a more modern setting!\n\n\u201cJohn taught law to Bill with the condition that Bill would pay the tuition fee after he had won his first case. Long after Bill finished his lessons, he did not get any case \u2013 either on purpose so that he never had to pay for the lessons or simply because no one hired him. John then sued Bill in small claims court for the tuition fee.\n\nJohn: If I win the suit, then by verdict Bill will have to pay me; however, if Bill wins, he will also have to pay me because our agreement says he will pay me when he\u2019s won his first case. As such, it would be wise for the court to simply make Bill pay me.\n\nBill: If I win the suit, then by verdict I needn\u2019t pay John. If John wins the case, then I still won\u2019t have to pay him because I haven\u2019t won any cases. As such, it would be wise for the court to throw out his suit.\n\nYou\u2019re the judge; what do you do?\u201d\n\n#5 \u2013 Classical philosopher and poet Epidmenides once wrote \u2018all Cretans are liars.\u2019 While this may seem like a simple phrase it was the birth of a new paradox, Epidmenides\u2019 Paradox. You see, Epidmenides himself was a Cretan, therefore he is stating that he too is a liar. However, if he is a liar, then his statement that \u2018all Cretans are liars\u2019 must also be a lie meaning that all Cretans tell the truth. This would then state that Epidmenides must tell the truth\u2026 A circular pattern of thinking leaves one trying to determine the phrase \u2018all Cretans are liars\u2019 can be both true and false at the same time.\n\n#6 \u2013 Zeno was a Greek philosopher in around 500 B.C.E. who proposed a number of interesting thought experiments and paradoxes, calling many areas of common thinking and beliefs into question. One of these areas was that of motion and its existence or lack thereof according to what he proposes as logical thinking. One of his famous \u2018Paradoxes of Motion,\u2019 the paradox of the arrow states this:\n\n\u201cFor motion to occur, an object must move from one place in space/time to another. Using an arrow as a reference, if an observer were able to stop time, you would notice that the arrow was not moving in that instant. The arrow had to be either moving to where it is, or moving to where it isn\u2019t, yet in any given instant the arrow is motionless. If in any instant no motion is occurring, then no motion can occur in any moment, and therefore motion cannot happen.\u201d\n\n#7 \u2013 Introduced by the Muslim philosopher Avicenna, the \u2018Floating Man Problem\u2019 questions our real existence in relation to our thoughts, memories, and experiences. This poses the question, what truly defines existence? It asks:\n\n\u201cImagine a man is created in total sensory deprivation. He cannot see, hear, taste, smell, or touch. Can he know that he exists?\u201d\n\nWhile Avicenna himself assumed the answer would be yes, pointing to the existence of the human soul, this question has continued to circulate among philosophers and not all shared his conclusion.\n\n#8 \u2013 In an effort to point out how different legal consequences can follow a homicide case depending on the twists that the situation may take, Don Harper Mills, the president of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences introduced the fictional murder case of Ronald Opus. Here is the original case in its entirety. If you were responsible for persecuting this case, what would your conclusion be?\n\n\u201cOn March 23, 1994, a medical examiner viewed the body of Ronald Opus and concluded that he died from a gunshot wound of the head caused by a shotgun. Investigation to that point had revealed that the decedent had jumped from the top of a ten-story building with the intent to commit suicide. (He left a note indicating his despondency.) As he passed the 9th floor on the way down, his life was interrupted by a shotgun blast through a window, killing him instantly. Neither the shooter nor the decedent was aware that a safety net had been erected at the 8th-floor level to protect some window washers, and that the decedent would most likely not have been able to complete his intent to commit suicide because of this.\n\nOrdinarily, a person who starts into motion the events with a suicide intent ultimately commits suicide even though the mechanism might not be what they intended. That he was shot on the way to certain death nine stories below probably would not change his mode of death from suicide to homicide, but the fact that his suicide intent would not have been achieved under any circumstance caused the medical examiner to feel that he had homicide on his hands.\n\nFurther investigation led to the discovery that the room on the 9th floor from whence the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by an elderly man and his wife. He was threatening her with the shotgun because of an interspousal spat and became so upset that he could not hold the shotgun straight. Therefore, when he pulled the trigger, he completely missed his wife, and the pellets went through the window, striking the decedent.\n\nWhen one intends to kill subject A but kills subject B in the attempt, one is guilty of the murder of subject B. The old man was confronted with this conclusion, but both he and his wife were adamant in stating that neither knew that the shotgun was loaded. It was the longtime habit of the old man to threaten his wife with an unloaded shotgun. He had no intent to murder her; therefore, the killing of the decedent appeared then to be accident. That is, the gun had been accidentally loaded.\n\nBut further investigation turned up a witness that their son was seen loading the shotgun approximately six weeks prior to the fatal accident. That investigation showed that the mother (the old lady) had cut off her son\u2019s financial support, and her son, knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun threateningly, loaded the gun with the expectation that the father would shoot his mother. The case now becomes one of murder on the part of the son for the death of Ronald Opus.\n\nNow comes the exquisite twist. Further investigation revealed that the son, Ronald Opus himself, had become increasingly despondent over the failure of his attempt to get his mother murdered. This led him to jump off the ten-story building on March 23, only to be killed by a shotgun blast through a 9th story window.\n\nThe medical examiner closed the case as a suicide.\u201d\n\n#9 \u2013 Here\u2019s one that will really get you thinking. While the exact origin of this picture is unknown, it has circulated a number of social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, and Google+. This one may have you stumped for a bit! How would you answer this riddle?\n\n#10 \u2013 In 1982 philosopher Frank Jackson came up with a thought experiment known as \u2018What Did Mary Know?\u2019 this as used to argue the association between consciousness and non-physical knowledge. Is it possible that there are some \u2018facts\u2019 in life that escape a real physical explanation?\n\n\u201cImagine a girl called Mary. She is a brilliant neuroscientist and a world expert on color vision. But because she grew up entirely in a black and white room, she has never actually seen any colors. Many black and white books and TV programmes have taught her all there is to know about color vision. Mary knows facts like the structure of our eyes and the exact wavelengths of light that stimulate our retinas when we look at a light blue sky.\n\nOne day, Mary escapes her monochrome room, and she walks through the grey city streets. She sees a red apple for the first time.\n\nWhat changes upon Mary\u2019s encounter with the red apple? Has Mary learnt anything new about the color red upon seeing the color for the first time?\u201d\n\n#11 \u2013 The Barn-Pole Paradox is one of a number of similar special relativity problems that use various props to make the same point. Approaching a situation from multiple points of view, it poses an interesting question that many find difficult to answer. The problem goes like this:\n\n\u201cThese are the props. You own a barn, 40 m long, with automatic doors at either end, that can be opened and closed simultaneously be a switch. You also have a pole, 80m long, which of course won\u2019t fit in the barn.\n\nNow someone takes the pole and tries to run (at nearly the speed of light) through the barn with the pole horizontal. Special Relativity (SR) says that a moving object is contracted in the direction of motion: this is called the Lorentz Contraction. So, if the pole is set in motion lengthwise, then it will contract in the reference frame of a stationary observer.\n\nYou are that observer, sitting on the barn roof. You see the pole coming towards you, and it has contracted to a bit less than 40m in your reference frame.\n\nSo, as the pole passes through the barn, there is an instant when it is completely within the barn. At that instant you close both doors simultaneously, with your switch. Of course, you open them again pretty quickly, but at least momentarily you had the contracted pole shut up in your barn. The runner emerges from the far door unscathed.\n\nBut consider the problem form the point of view of the runner. She will regard the pole as stationary, and the barn as approaching at high speed. In this reference frame, the pole is still 80m long, and the barn is less than 20m long. Surely the runner is in trouble if the doors close while she is inside. The pole is sure to get caught.\n\nWell, does the pole get caught in the door or doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n#12 \u2013 Greek philosopher Socrates was once quoted saying, \u201cI know one thing; that I know nothing.\u201d While his intention was to highlight that the more we know, the more we don\u2019t know, with the acquisition of more knowledge only leading us to more unanswered questions, the whole concept can leave you thinking for hours. Based on what you currently \u2018know\u2019 today, what do you not know? What will you not know tomorrow?\n\n#13 \u2013 The \u2018Ship of Theseus\u2019 or \u2018Theseus\u2019s Paradox\u2019 is a thought experiment most notably recorded by Plutarch in the last first century. The original paradox stated:\n\n\u201cThe ship wherein Theseus and the youth of Athens returned from Crete had thirty oars, and was preserved by the Athenians down even to the time of Demetrius Phalereus, for they took away the old planks as they decayed, putting in new and stronger timber in their places, in so much that this ship became a standing example among the philosophers, for the logical question of things that grow; one side holding that the ship remained the same, and the other contending that it was not the same.\u201d\n\nModern takes on this paradox include a sock where the holes are replaced with patches, or \u2018grandfather\u2019s axe\u2019 which, over time, has had both the handle and the head replaced. Is it still considered the original axe, or is it now a new object?\n\n#14 \u2013 Irish scientist William Molyneux posed this question in 1688 and it still has many of us thinking today!\n\n\u201cIf a man who is born blind learns to distinguish between a sphere and a cube by touching them, and one day regains his sight, would he be able to tell which of the objects placed in front of him is a sphere and a cube by only looking at them?\u201d What do you think?\n\n#15 \u2013 Olbers\u2019 Paradox was named after German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers. Also known as the \u2018Dark Night Sky Paradox\u2019 it argues that the darkness of the night sky conflicts with the stated fact that there is an infinite number of stars in the universe. By this theory of the infinite stars, any line of sight from Earth must, ultimately, end at the surface of a star, which would, by definition, be bright. So why is the sky that we observe dark?\n\n#16 \u2013 A story first used by American philosopher Edmund L. Gettier in his discussions about the concept of \u2018justified true belief,\u2019 this is sure to leave you wondering!\n\n\u201cA near-sighted farmer anxiously asked the milkman whether he\u2019d seen a cow on his rounds because his cow was missing. The milkman pointed further down the road and told the farmer, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, she\u2019s over there in that field.\u201d The farmer squinted and saw a black and white shape near some trees in the middle of the field and thanked the milkman in relief. Meanwhile, as the milkman passed the field he took another look and notice that the cow was actually hidden by high grass; what he\u2019d pointed out to the farmer were black and white sheets hanging in a tree. Even though the cow was in the field, was the milkman correct when he\u2019d said he knew it was there?\u201d\n\n#17 \u2013 While discussing the topic of personal identity, British philosopher Derek Parfit introduced what has now come to be known as the \u2018Teletransporter Thought Experiment.\u2019 It asked this \u2013 if you were to use a teleporter in order to travel to Mars, and this specific device mapped out every particle within your body, creating an exact replica of yourself on Mars while destroying the original here on Earth, maintaining your memories along with the memories, and others have no doubt in meeting you that this is you\u2026 From a \u2018first-person perspective\u2019 having used the teleporter, would you continue to exist or are you actually dead? An interesting thought with the growing interest in new forms of space travel in our future!\n\n#18 \u2013 Consider this question first asked by Archytas in 5th Century BC: \u201cIf I arrived at the outermost edge of the heaven (universe), could I extend my hand or staff into what is outside or not?\u201d This raises a seriously interesting question\u2026 What exactly is the Universe expanding into? Is it a void or nothingness? If so, wouldn\u2019t that void also be part of our Universe?\n\n#19 \u2013 Have you ever stopped to consider the existence of \u2018intention\u2019 and what it truly means? This is what as called into question by moral and political philosopher Gregory S. Kavka in \u2018The Toxin Puzzle,\u2019 first introduced in 1983. It states that:\n\n\u201cAn eccentric billionaire places before you a vial of toxin that, if you drink it, will make you painfully ill for a day, but will not threaten your life or have any lasting effects. The billionaire will pay you one million dollars tomorrow morning if, at midnight tonight, you intend to drink the toxin tomorrow afternoon. He emphasizes that you need not drink the toxin to receive the money; in fact, the money will already be in your bank account hours before the time for drinking it arrives, if you succeed. All you have to do is. . . intend at midnight tonight to drink the stuff tomorrow afternoon. You are perfectly free to change your mind after receiving the money and not drink the toxin.\u201d\n\nThe question remains; however, can you actually intend to drink the toxin if you know that you intend to change your mind at a later time? Or does intending to change your mind negate your claim to intend to drink it?\n\n#20 \u2013 The crocodile dilemma, also known as crocodile sophism, is a paradox that dates back to ancient Greece. It is believed to be logically impossible, however, it is sure to get you thinking! The paradox goes like this:\n\n\u201cA crocodile has captured a little boy. Being the reasonable crocodile that he is, the croc promises the little boy\u2019s father that he will release the kid only if the father can predict what the crocodile will do next. The father of the boy says, \u201cYou will not give my son back.\u201d Now the croc is in a bind. If the feather was correct in his statement, the croc keeps the kid. But if the croc keeps the kid, the croc is not keeping his promise to return the boy. But once the croc returns the boy, the father\u2019s prediction is no longer correct. What should the crocodile do?\u201d\n\n#21 \u2013 Referred to as \u2018The Trolley Problem,\u2019 this ethical dilemma has stumped people for generations. Sometimes told with a trolley, other times told with a train, the question is raised, will you personally take a life to save the lives of many?\n\n\u201cThere is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person on the side track. You have two options: (1) Do nothing, and the trolley kills the five people on the main track. (2) Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.

Mueller is doing anything but slowing down his Russia investigation. There is no immediate end in sight as Mueller continues to investigate possible Trump campaign collusion with Russian officials. It could be well into 2018 before Mueller and his team complete their investigation.\n\nTrump\u2019s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his business partner, Rick Gates, were the first ones indicted and charged with tax fraud and money laundering. Mueller also indicted former White House foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos and former national security adviser Michael Flynn on charges of lying to the FBI. Both pled guilty to the charges.\n\nNow, Corey Lewandowski, who was Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager until he was fired in June 2016, is set to testify before Congress about Russia election meddling. According to the New York Post:\n\n\u2018President Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski revealed on Sunday that he is expected to appear this week before a House panel probing Russian involvement in the 2016 election. \u2018Lewandowski said his appearance before the House Intelligence Committee either on Wednesday or Thursday is voluntary and will take place behind closed doors.\u2019\n\nLewandowski said:\n\n\u2018I\u2019m happy to do it\u200b. I didn\u2019t collude or cooperate or coordinate with any Russian, Russian agency, Russian government or anybody else, to try and impact this election.\u200b I\u2019ll be happy to come out and set the record straight about my lack of involvement with any type of foreign entity\u200b.\u200b\u2019\n\nAlso, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is expected to testify before the same House panel this week. Trump and Bannon have been feuding since author Michael Wolff released his new tell-all book titled \u201cFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House.\u201d At one point, Bannon describes Trump as \u201cacting like a nine-year old.\u201d\n\nLewandowski said he hasn\u2019t actually been contacted by Mueller yet, but said he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to be interviewed. He said:\n\n\u2018So, let\u2019s come to a resolution. If you need to talk to people who were involved in the campaign to bring that to a resolution, let\u2019s do that\u200b. \u200bBut it\u2019s time to bring this investigation to a close.\u2019\n\nTrump maintains that Mueller wouldn\u2019t be likely to interview him since there was \u201cno collusion.\u201d However, Mueller has reached out the president\u2019s lawyers and it\u2019s very possible. Lewandowski said that he would urge Trump to tell the truth. He said:\n\n\u200b\u2019There\u2019s no question to me, that if he were to sit down and tell that team exactly what took place, and I was there for it, they will come to the same conclusion that everybody else has already come to, which is there is no collusion\u200b.\u2019\n\nLewandowski is also in hot water for accusations by singer Joy Villa that he assaulted her at a Trump hotel party.\n\nAccording to USA Today:\n\n\u2018Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told USA TODAY that he believes the House panel still has \u201cmany months of work ahead of us.\u201d He added, however, that he\u2019s worried that Republicans on the committee may be trying to rush the investigation to a \u201cpremature\u201d close because of pressure from the White House to bring it to an end.\u2019\n\nLet\u2019s grab the popcorn and see what happens in the coming months.\n\nThis is how Twitter responded:\n\nFeatured image by Taylor Hill/Getty Images", "domain": "bipartisanreport.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://bipartisanreport.com/2018/01/14/n-y-post-drops-lewandowski-testimony-bombshell-that-has-trump-sweating-bullets/"}

And while it may save you a lot of money, flying coach is hardly ever a pleasant experience \u2013 unless of course the flight is hardly booked and you end up with an entire row to yourself. But if you\u2019re on a full flight, then you have to squeeze into your tiny seat with two people you might not know breathing heavy and sneezing on either side of you.\n\nWhile boarding most planes, coach passengers have to walk past the first class passengers as they sip champagne and get pampered in their leather seats. It\u2019s easy to feel jealous of their privilege. And because the airline only provides exceptional service to the first class passengers, those in coach get the short end of the stick. With crusty peanuts and sloppy servings of soda, coach has nothing going for it besides saving you some cash.\n\nIn the same vein, service men and women may be given special treatment while boarding the plane \u2013 but if they didn\u2019t pay for it, they don\u2019t get first class treatment.\n\nBut on a recent flight, Jessica Titus, a coach passenger, noticed a man from the first-class section approach a female servicewoman who was walking through \u201chis\u201d section of the plane. He sneered at her then followed her back to coach with his eyes.\n\nBefore she could get any further, he stood up and physically blocked her way. This tactic, employed by abusive husbands and boyfriends, shocked the service woman. And she immediately put up her defense.\n\nHowever, the aggressive stranger had an alternative motive. And it was nothing as it seemed. Instead, he offered to trade his first class seat for her coach one. He wanted the Army servicewoman to be treated like royalty because she had served America in his stead and he wanted to show her his appreciation for that.\n\nAlthough she hadn\u2019t the money to purchase a first class ticket, the rich man thought she \u201cdeserved\u201d to sit in first class more than he did. That\u2019s why he stood up and trade seats with her in front of everyone.\n\nTitus explained the story in a Love What Matters post on Facebook:\n\n\u201cOn my flight Tuesday, I walked down the jetway behind a woman in uniform (Army). A man stood up from his 1st class seat and said, \u2018Sorry ma\u2019am, I\u2019m in your seat.\u2019 \u2018What does your ticket say?\u2019 He asked. She replied, \u2018What? No \u2013 I\u2019m 31 B.\u2019 He walked away, leaving her with his first class seat and then took her middle seat in coach.\u201d\n\nIn response, Titus wanted to give the generous man a treat for honoring the servicewoman when no one else would. She wrote a short note and then attached a small bill to it to help get him a drink or snack. But the do-gooder refused to take her money.\n\n\u201cSpoiler alert, he refused my offer. Do good. Recognize good. Make the world better.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think about this first class passenger\u2019s kindness toward our service men and women?", "domain": "awm.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://awm.com/first-class-passenger-sees-a-soldier-walking-up-the-aisle-denies-her-access-to-her-seat-3/"}

She lost her job and lost her home. Despite the hardship, Dionna has refused to give up on her future. She is a trainee nurse.\n\nThe mother and son duo received a big break when they finally qualified for government housing. It gave Dionna a chance to put down some roots so she could grow and strengthen her family. But the state housing only came with two chairs and an air mattress.\n\nBecause Dionna has been working hard to provide for Daeyrs, the non-profit organization \u201cHumble Design\u201d took notice. So, they decided to do something generous for the struggling mother. They came in and completely redid their home with new furniture and d\u00e9cor.\n\nAnd as they were giving Daeyrs a tour of what they did to their house, the young boy burst into tears of relief. After struggling all his life, he now had his own bed and a real home to live in with his beloved mother.\n\nThe Michigan state housing came after years of struggle. And during Christmas, Daeyrs had one simple wish. He wanted his own bed to sleep in at night.\n\nHumble Home heard about the pair after the social worker handling their case referred them to the organization.\n\nAs a result, Humble Home completely redecorated their home with d\u00e9cor and comfortable furniture. Until the day he got his bed, Daeyrs was sleeping on the floor in blankets.\n\nHumble Design completely surprised Daeyrs with the makeover. And at the video, he calls himself \u201cthe man of the house\u201d because he now has is own furnished bedroom.\n\nDuring the film, the boy bursts into tears of relief and joy when he sees his remade room for the first time. It is no longer just an empty room with four walls. He now has a bed, furniture, toys, and cushions. Humble Design even gave Daeyrs an art set that he has dreamed of having.\n\nThe video was filmed on December 20.\n\nHumble Design\u2019s lead designer and founder Treger Strasberg said, \u201cThey moved into this house but didn\u2019t have any furniture and were sleeping on the floor. We were referred to Daeyrs and his mother by a social worker, and our first order of business was to ask them exactly what they would like in their house to make it feel like a home. Seeing how much having a bed and his own room meant to Daeyrs, it really made me realize what\u2019s important in life and grateful for everything I have. He was so excited to have his own room, but also so overwhelmed by what having this really means for him after all he\u2019s been through \u2013 to have a place to stay and just be a normal kid with no worries.\u201d\n\nSee the heartwarming moment now!", "domain": "awm.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://awm.com/homeless-8-year-old-is-given-a-bed-for-christmas-his-reaction-will-have-you-crying-video/"}

But he is not just the richest man at this moment in history. He is the richest person who has ever lived. As of 2017 he and seven other billionaires had a collective net worth equal to that of the poorest 3.6 billion people on earth.\n\nThese figures have been in the news of late but without much useful analysis. The corporate media refuse to state what is obvious. Namely that inequality is worse around the world precisely because these super rich people demand it.\n\nWhile pundits and politicians go on breathlessly about oligarchs in Russia, they seldom take a look at the wealthiest in their own back yard and the control they exert over the lives of millions of people. When Amazon announced it would choose a site for its new headquarters cities across the country began a furious race to the bottom. Amazon is not alone in the thievery department. Major corporations like Walmart always request and receive public property and public funds in order to do business.\n\n\u201cBoston offering $75 million to Amazon while Houston is willing to part with $268 million.\u201d\n\nSome 235 cities have put themselves in the running for this dubious venture. Chicago is willing to give Amazon $1.3 billion in payroll taxes that prospective employees would ordinarily pay that city. If Chicago wins this booby prize Amazon employees would pay taxes to their employer and not to the government. This is truly cutting out the middle man and makes real the rule of, by, and for the wealthiest.\n\nThe potential for public outrage isn\u2019t lost on unprincipled politicians. Some cities now refuse to reveal how much they plan to give away. But the news to date is disheartening with Boston offering $75 million while Houston is willing to part with $268 million. Amazon says it will hire 50,000 people but their business model already pays employees so little that many of them qualify for public assistance, despite being employed.\n\nThe United States is as much of an oligarchy as countries it usually disparages but it is far more dishonest about its true nature. All talk of democracy is a lie as the rich get richer, by an additional $1 trillion in 2017, and wield more and more power over the lives of everyone else.\n\n\u201cChicago is willing to give Amazon $1.3 billion in payroll taxes that prospective employees would ordinarily pay that city.\u201d\n\nThe Bezos juggernaut is not restricted to theft of public money. He is also the sole owner of the Washington Post, one of the most influential newspapers in the country. Bezos owns a newspaper that is an organ of the ruling elite and he also has a $600 million contract to provide the Central Intelligence Agency with cloud computing services.\n\nThe Washington Post was the force behind Propaganda or Not, an effort to destroy left wing voices like those at Black Agenda Report. Under the guise of fighting Russia and so-called fake news the Bezos owned Post began the censorship campaign that has put the left\u2019s presence on the internet in such jeopardy.\n\nPoliticians outdo one another giving away public resources to the richest man on the planet who also owns a major newspaper and services the surveillance state. If it can be said that any one person rules the world Bezos would be obvious choice. No one in Chicago, Boston, Houston or any of the other cities giving away the store ever voted for Jeff Bezos. All talk of democracy is a sham as long as the richest people take from the rest of humanity.\n\nThe effort to make government an irrelevance is thoroughly bipartisan. Republicans and Democrats alike are willing to turn over government coffers to Bezos and his ilk and the rights of the people be damned.\n\n\u201cThe Bezos owned Post began the censorship campaign that has put the left\u2019s presence on the internet in such jeopardy.\u201d\n\nWhoever wins this tarnished brass ring ought to be consigned to political defeat. The mayor, aldermen, city council members or whoever else brings disaster to their locality should be punished for aiding and abetting the theft. If these cities can give to the richest man who ever lived, they can surely use public money to help their residents right now. But they will never do that because they are all bought off and compromised. They are either cynical or afraid to go against the real rulers of the country.\n\nBezos may look like the villain in a James Bond movie but there is nothing funny about him. He is deadly serious and so are his intentions. In a Bezos run world every worker will be impoverished, every level of government will subsidize corporations, and anyone who speaks out will be discredited and under surveillance.\n\nThe last thing any city needs is a new Amazon headquarters. We need an end to billionaire rule in this country and around the world. That will be the salvation of the people, not more sweat shops run by wealthy people who steal from everyone else.\n\nMargaret Kimberley\u2019s Freedom Rider column appears weekly in BAR, and is widely reprinted elsewhere.

The announcement was made by Red's CEO and founder, Jim Jannard, who also revealed the additional new specs for Hydrogen One.\n\nAccording to Jannard, the 5.7-inch screen of the Hydrogen One will boast of two modes: A regular 2D mode and a 4-View (4V) holographic mode, also known as the brand's version of 3D. For Jannard, though, the holographic mode is better than a 3D images even without the accompanying 3D glasses as proven by those who have already experienced 4V in person, who, according to the Red CEO, reacted with \"gasps, swears or just grins.\"\n\nWhile the 4V format of the Hydrogen One is new, Jannard suggests that it will get support from different social media sites. Furthermore, the Red CEO also revealed that his company will establish a \"Hydrogen Network,\" which will be a platform for the new format.\n\n\"This will be the one place to find all 4V content online. From major studios and other content providers to creating your own channel,\" Jannard said.\n\nAlthough it can't be denied that its holographic ability is the major selling point of Hydrogen One, it is not the only thing it boasts of. Apart from a body that is made of either aluminum or titanium, Hydrogen One also packs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835X processor and comes with a dual SIM slot, 4,500mAh battery, USB-C port, built-in speakers capable of playing multi-channel spacial audio, stackable modules that connect via pogo pins for power and data, expandable storage via a MicroSD slot, and a headphone jack.\n\nWhile all its specs and features are nothing short of impressive, Hydrogen One can only prove that it is worth its $1,200 price tag when it is finally dropped on the market this summer.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/hydrogen-one-news-reds-first-ever-smartphone-to-arrive-in-summer-boasts-of-holographic-display-214907/"}

Hargan stated that the new division was part of the Trump administration's overall effort to advance religious liberty protections.\n\n\"President Trump promised the American people that his administration would vigorously uphold the rights of conscience and religious freedom. That promise is being kept today,\" stated Hargan in a statement released Thursday.\n\n\"The Founding Fathers knew that a nation that respects conscience rights is more diverse and more free, and OCR's new division will help make that vision a reality.\"\n\nSince taking office, President Donald Trump has sought measures to broaden religious exemptions to HHS policies, like the Obama era contraception mandate.\n\nLast October, the administration passed two new rules allowing for both for-profit and non-profit entities to get exemptions from the Affordable Care Act law requiring employers to provide birth control coverage.\n\n\"The Republican president signed an executive order in May asking for rules that would allow religious groups to deny their employees insurance coverage for services they oppose on religious grounds,\" reported Reuters last year.\n\n\"The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Friday moved to broaden those narrow religious exemptions to include an exception 'on the basis of moral conviction' for non-profit and for-profit companies.\"\n\nThe new division has come under fire from some liberal organizations, who claim that the initiative will be used to advance discrimination.\n\n\"This is the use of religion to hurt people because you disapprove of who they are,\" said Harper Jean Tobin of the National Center for Transgender Equality, as quoted by Politico.\n\n\"Any rule that grants a license to discriminate would be a disgrace and a mockery of the principal of religious freedom we all cherish.\"\n\nOthers, including Ryan T. Anderson of the Heritage Foundation, have argued that this negative portrayal of the new division and its conscience protections are inaccurate.\n\n\"I don't know of a single example of a doctor who 'refuses' to 'treat transgender patients.'

He now has \u201cdeep reservations\u201d about use of the term \u201cBlack misleadership class,\u201d because \u201cit implies that there is or ought to be a class of good and righteous black leaders.\u201d The term is \u201csloppy and imprecise,\u201d Dixon writes, adding (I hope) sarcastically:\n\n\u201cMaybe the good ones are supposed to be the \u2018real\u2019 blacks and the bad ones unreal. Maybe the difference [is] having or lacking character, table manners, home training or \u2018real\u2019 blackness, or even some kind of black magic.\u201d\n\nThis is all quite cute, but bears no connection to the way the term \u201cBlack misleadership class\u201d has been deployed by every one of BAR\u2019s editors, including Dixon, since the publication\u2019s inaugural issue in October, 2006 -- and by Dixon, Margaret Kimberley and myself in our previous duties at The Black Commentator. It is as if Bruce imagines that he has been in the company of narrow Black cultural nationalists all these years, and has finally broken loose from such mysticism. He appears to believe that his colleagues -- and, apparently, his former self -- have been guided by perceptions of Black leaders\u2019 \u201cauthentic or inauthentic blackness,\u201d rather than their \u201cclass allegiance.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is as if Bruce imagines that he has been in the company of narrow Black cultural nationalists all these years, and has finally broken loose from such mysticism.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a broad brush, and inflicted on the wrong people. The language of Black \u201cauthenticity\u201d seldom appears in Black Agenda Report, and virtually never from the pens of its editors. During Barack Obama\u2019s first presidential campaign, his boosters, mainly in the corporate media, claimed that Obama\u2019s Black detractors were obsessed with the idea that he lacks \u201cauthentic\u201d Blackness. However, BAR\u2019s problem with Obama has always been that he is a corporate warmonger \u2013 an \u201cauthentic\u201d toady for the ruling class. Our critique of Obama has consistently focused on the class that he serves. But Bruce seems to remember things differently.\n\nI have so deeply embraced the \u201cBlack misleadership class\u201d terminology, I thought I coined it, myself. But, a thorough Google search of both BAR and The Black Commentator provides no evidence of my authorship. Instead, the first use of \u201cBlack misleaderhip class\u201d by anyone appears in the March 17, 2005, issue of The Black Commentator \u2013 then under my editorship -- in an article by James Warren, titled \u201cThirty-Seven Years of Non-Struggle Misleadership.\u201d Warren, who described himself as having \u201cbeen active in the Black and Labor movement for over 35 years,\u201d refers variously to a Black \u201cmisleadership class\u201d and \u201cBlack mis-leadership\u201d as standing in the way of \u201cour most prized possession\u2026the ordinary working class men and women waking up as if from a deep sleep.\u201d\n\nThe next reference to the term appears in the title of Bruce Dixon\u2019s February 9, 2006, piece, \u201cFailure of the Black Misleadership Class.\u201d However, \u201cmisleadership\u201d does not appear in the rest of the body of the work. Instead, Dixon uses the term \u201cblack leadership\u201d 17 times, without the prefix \u201cmis.\u201d Three months later, on May 11, 2006, Dixon refers to the \u201cblack misleadership class,\u201d and later \u201cthe black business leadership class,\u201d in an article titled \u201cThe Black Stake in the Internet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first use of 'Black misleaderhip class' by anyone appears in the March 17, 2005, issue of The Black Commentator, in an article by James Warren.\u201d\n\nIn an article titled \u201cThe Black Caucus\u2019 Fatal FOX News Embrace,\u201d that has disappeared from the archives of Black Agenda Report but was picked up by Common Dreams on June 6, 2007, Leutisha Stills refers to \u201cthe groveling mentality of a Black misleadership class that watches African Americans get their asses kicked every day of the year by Rupert Murdoch and the entirety of corporate media\u2026.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t show up in Google using the BMC term until October 9, 2010 when I condemn \u201ca misleadership class that sells out the people at every turn\u201d in a video of a speech to the Black Is Back Coalition.\n\nBAR editors Marsha Coleman-Adebayo, Ajamu Baraka, and Margaret Kimberley have all used the term, in articles posted on March 12, 2015, September 14, 2017, and January 18, 2017, respectively. Coleman-Adebayo blasted the \u201cBlack mis-leadership class\u201d for orchestrating an elaborate kabuki theatre in the city of Selma, Alabama\u201d; Baraka excoriated the \u201cblack mis-leadership class\u201d for fully participating in \u201cthe process to deliver the people\u2019s resources to the ruling elite\u201d; and Kimberley denounced Atlanta Congressman John Lewis for exemplifying \u201ceverything that is wrong with the Congressional Black Caucus, the Democratic Party and the black misleadership class.\u201d\n\nNellie Bailey, an editor and co-host of the weekly Black Agenda Radio program, is a consistent user of the term. Indeed, until Bruce Dixon\u2019s recantation of December 21, all of BAR\u2019s editors cited the sins and crimes of the \u201cBlack misleadership class\u201d \u2013 with Dixon and me blasting the BMC most often.\n\nBrother Dixon now prefers to substitute \u201cpolitical\u201d for \u201cmisleader.\u201d He writes that the \u201cblack political class\u201d (Dixon does not capitalize \u201cBlack\u201d -- I do) \u201chappens to be a class to which most of us don\u2019t belong.\u201d But he is the one guilty of \u201csloppy\u201d and \u201cimprecise\u201d usage. Bruce and I and the rest of the activist/writers/analysts at BAR do belong to the broad Black political class. He is restricting membership in the political classes to elected officials and, presumably, lobbyists, corporate media commentators and business friendly civic organization \u201cspokespersons\u201d that carry the rulers\u2019 political water. Grassroots political activists are written out of Dixon\u2019s definition of \u201cpolitics\u201d -- even those who dedicate most of their waking hours to \u201cpeople\u2019s\u201d causes. Most Black preachers and academics (except those whom media award the title \u201cpublic intellectual\u201d) would be excluded, too. The bourgeoisie certainly prefer the narrowest definition of political class, restricted to those who speak for Power.\n\n\u201cGrassroots political activists are written out of Dixon\u2019s definition of \u2018politics.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor those of us who don\u2019t work for the rulers, \u201cpolitical class\u201d winds up being of little use, much like the term \u201cthe chattering classes.\u201d We all chatter. The question is: Who is chattering to whom, about what, and in whose interests?\n\n\u201cBlack Misleadership class\u201d is not a \u2018scientific\u201d term. It is weaponized political terminology, with specific meaning based on Black historical and current political realities. Most often, in our usage at BAR, the term refers to those Black political forces that emerged at the end of the Sixties, eager to join the corporate and duopoly political (mostly Democrat) ranks, and to sell out the interests of the overwhelmingly working class Black masses in the process. It is both an actual and aspirational class, which ultimately sees its interests as tied to those of U.S. imperialism and its ruling circles. It seeks representation in the halls of corporate power, and dreads social transformation, which would upset the class\u2019s carefully cultivated relationships with Power.\n\nWe know who these people are, based on their political behaviors. Our job, as conscious \u201cpolitical\u201d people, is to expose their treachery -- so that the Black masses will reject their \u201cmisleadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cUntil Bruce Dixon\u2019s recantation of December 21, all of BAR\u2019s editors cited the sins and crimes of the 'Black misleadership class.'\u201d\n\nThe following is excerpted from an article of mine that has disappeared from BAR\u2019s archives, but which was picked up by the August 31, 2014 Greanville Post, titled, \u201cBlack Folks are Going Nowhere Until We Discard the Black Misleadership Class.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe current Black Misleadership Class voluntarily joined the enemy camp -- calling it \u2018progress\u2019 -- as soon as the constraints of official apartheid were lifted. They exploited the political and business opportunities made possible by a people\u2019s mass movement in order to advance their own selfish agendas and, in the process, made a pact with Power to assist in the debasement and incarceration of millions of their brothers and sisters. In the case of Black elected officials, their culpability is direct and hands-on. The professional \u2018interlocutors\u2019 between African Americans and Power, from the local butt-kissing preacher to marquis power-brokers like Al Sharpton, serve as the Mass Black Incarceration State\u2019s firemen\u2026.\u201d\n\nStudents of Black history will immediately recognize the role played by these Black \u201cfiremen\u201d: they are the \u201cHouse Negroes\u201d that Malcolm X inveighed against; the aspiring or professional \u201ctype of Negro\u201d who, when the master\u2019s house started burning down, \u201cwould fight harder to put the master\u2019s house out than the master himself would.\u201d -- Malcolm X, Wayne State University, January 23, 1963.\n\nMalcolm struggled on behalf of the \u201cfield Negro,\u201d the working class masses. \u201cHouse Negro\u201d and \u201cField Negro\u201d were not scientific terms; they were political weapons that resonated among the Black masses. They had sharp, cutting edges, designed to rebuke and isolate the internal enemy, and to discourage other Black people from collaborating with the ruling class.\n\nOur mission today is no different.\n\nThey are the 'House Negroes' that Malcolm X inveighed against.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, in a speech marking the first national conference of Students Against Mass Incarceration, at Howard University, I explained why BAR makes \u201cfull use\u201d of the term, \u201cBlack misleadership class\u201d:\n\n\u201cSome folks might think we mainly use it as an insult. And we DO.\n\n\u201cWe believe that denunciation and shaming of those behaviors and politics that are destructive to our people is a good and useful thing to do.\n\n\u201cWhen people who claim to be Black leaders aid in the destruction of our people, they deserve to be insulted -- \u201cbuked and scorned,' as we used to say.\n\n\u201cSo, of course we mean to insult these people that we call the Black Misleadership Class\u2026.\n\n\u201cThey wanted to put their own upwardly mobile faces in high government and corporate places. That meant preserving the system -- not tearing it down.\n\n\u201cThey wanted to celebrate their own upward mobility, not agitate for social transformation. So, after 1968, they helped shut the Movement down.\n\n\u201cIn order to consolidate their own political power, and curry corporate favor, the Black Misleadership Class directed Black people\u2019s energies toward the narrowest electoral politics and the crassest materialism. Their modus operandi is to treat the masses of Black people as cheerleaders for the upward strivings of a few.\n\n\u201cThe ultimate expression of that madness, is that the Black Misleadership Class poured all of its energies into protecting a symbol of ultra-upward Black mobility -- Barack Obama -- while the bottom fell out for the Black masses.\n\n\u201cThis is the same class that has historically been far more ashamed over Mass Black Incarceration, than outraged. They resent those Blacks who have been caught up in the criminal justice system, because they mess up the petty bourgeois picture of Black America that they like to paint.\n\n\u201cThey have no use for the rest of us, except as props in their for-profit productions.\n\n\u201cSo, damn right, we like to insult the Black Misleadership Class. It\u2019s part of our political work. They need to be insulted.\n\n\u201cWe need a Movement, not just to deal with our external enemies, but also our internal ones. Because they are killing us, from the inside out.\u201d\n\nBrother Dixon may be willing to give up a perfectly good weapon, but I am not.\n\nDown with the Black misleadership class!

There will be famines, pestilences and earthquakes in various places.\"\n\nStill, the evangelist said that God might spare America destructive judgment if Christians start turning toward repentance, such as the Jews did in Joel 2.\n\n\"God tells them, 'If you will return to Me and rend your hearts, not your garments, who knows but that I will return to you and leave behind a blessing?' So if America \u2014 and I don't mean America as a whole because I wouldn't expect America as a whole to repent of her sin \u2014 but if Christians would come back to the cross, and if we would rend our hearts,\" she suggested, calling on people to live unto God.\n\nThis isn't Lotz's first warning. She spoke out against what she called the serious divisions in America on a number of occasions in 2017.\n\n\"The atmosphere in our world is explosive. Toxic. Dark. Dangerous to the extreme. And at this very moment when our nation should be standing together against wickedness and lawlessness, we are seriously divided,\" Lotz wrote on Facebook in August.\n\n\"It's time to 'inquire of the Lord.' Now! It's time to humble ourselves and pray and seek God's face and turn from our wicked ways, so He will hear from heaven and forgive our sin and heal our land. (2 Chronicles 7:14),\" she urged.\n\nThe evangelist further warned in September that God may be hiding Himself from the U.S. because of its \"national sins.\"\n\n\"Our nation is in a mess. Why? Could it be because America is losing God's blessing? And His favor? Could our sin be provoking His judgment? Judgment that is not necessarily in the form of a nuclear dirty bomb, or in another ISIS attack, or in an economic collapse,\" she wrote in an op-ed piece for HelloChristian.com.\n\n\"But in a Romans 1 judgment that is described as 'the wrath of God being revealed against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness' ... and God is backing out of our national life and turning us over to ourselves.\"", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/anne-graham-lotz-nuclear-strike-earthquake-could-be-coming-to-unrepentant-america-214269/"}

That is what we are looking at here.\"\n\nHestrin explained that the children, ranging in ages from 2 to 29, were starved so much their growth was stunted. It is alleged that the Turpins would buy food like apple pies and leave them uneaten on a counter to taunt the children who were frequently tied up with rope. They would then be hogtied when they tried to escape.\n\nAccording to CBS, their 29-year-old sibling weighed just 82 pounds, and a 12 year old weighed as much as an average 7 year old.\n\nAfter being beaten and choked in chains for months at a time, the children began planning their escape two years ago and on Sunday, their moment of deliverance came. Their 17-year-old sister armed with an inactive cell phone escaped through a window and dialed 911 leading authorities to the home.\n\nWhat police subsequently saw was shocking, Hestrin explained, according to CBS.\n\n\"One of the reasons for the punishments were if the children were found to wash their hands above the wrist area, they were accused of playing in the water, and they would be chained up,\" Hestrin said, noting the siblings were allowed to shower no more than once a year.\n\nIn more than four years, he said, none of the children had been to a doctor and they had never seen a dentist. They had very little knowledge of the outside world and were poorly homeschooled.\n\nJust one of the older siblings attended classes at a local college and he was strictly supervised by his mother.\n\nThe siblings were reportedly forced to sleep during the day and stay up at night. Their parents would also buy them new toys but never let them take the toys out of the box.\n\nHestrin said the only entertainment the children had was writing in journals and authorities had recovered hundreds of journals which are being checked for evidence of how the siblings lived.\n\n\"I think those journals are going to be strong evidence of what occurred in that home,\" Hestrin said.\n\nOn Thursday, David and Louise Turpin were charged with 12 criminal counts of torture, seven counts of abuse of a dependent adult, and 12 counts of false imprisonment that could keep them behind bars for life if they are convicted. David Turpin also faces one count of committing a lewd act by force or fear.

To label them 's***hole countries' from the seat of power and privilege because they are poor and weak is to stand against Jesus who loved this world so much that he came into it to save it rather than just condemn it as it deserves (John 3:16-17).\"\n\nOlson's criticism stems from the much-reported on comments attributed to Trump during an Oval Office meeting on immigration last week, when the president is said to have referred to Haiti, El Salvador, and African nations as \"s***hole countries.\"\n\nWhat is more, Trump said America should take in more immigrants from European countries like Norway instead.\n\nThe precise wording and context of Trump's reported remarks have been widely debated. Trump has denied saying those words and some lawmakers who were at the meeting say the president did not make those exact remarks. But others, including Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin, affirmed that the controversial comment was made.\n\nMembers on Trump's evangelical council have been divided over the alleged remarks.\n\nMegachurch pastor Jentezen Franklin, who leads the Free Chapel Church, was one of those who criticized the language used, stating:\n\n\"I don't agree with what the president said this week. It was wrong what he said. I say that respectfully. There's no nations that are trash and I'm putting it kind what he said. There's no people in those nations that are worthless and trash.\"\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, stated that calling other countries \"s***holes\" is \"wrong, inappropriate, and hurtful.\"\n\n\"Why? Because when God looks at these nations, He sees His children,\" Rodriguez said.\n\n\"Every single person is created in the image of God. Without exception.\"\n\nCouncil spokesman Johnnie Moore, meanwhile, expressed doubts on the veracity of the claims, arguing that they are \"absolutely suspect and politicized.\"\n\nOlson, who in his blog noted that he has been an evangelical his entire life, pointed out that Jesus Christ himself was a \"citizen of a 's***hole country' if there ever was one,\" clarifying that that is what Trump's labeling would argue.\n\n\"In fact, however, we evangelicals believe the whole world is a 's***hole country' compared with the glory from which Jesus came when he was born in Bethlehem,\" he wrote.\n\nOlson said that he is unwilling to give up the \"evangelical\" label even as it becomes increasingly difficult to hold on to, with many in society associating it automatically with support for Trump.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/theologian-calls-on-trump-backing-evangelicals-to-admit-theyve-been-wrong-after-shole-remarks-214419/"}

She said, 'Having quiet time,'\" Newbell said, as she tried to mimic her assistant's cheerful voice.\n\n\"I thought Christians were crazy and I thought, 'If you are about to take that Bible and say something with it, I am going to take that Bible and smack you,'\" she continued. \"That's where I was, which is so hard for people to think of if you know me now because the Lord did amazing work.\"\n\nNewbell explained that by the end of the night, she was crying, confessing her sins, and telling her assistant her life story.\n\nDespite the powerful experience that night, Newbell said that she did not give her life to Christ that night because she had a boyfriend that she \"did not want to give up at that time.\"\n\nIt was at the age of 22, Newbell stated, that she was \"humbled\" after suffering from two broken engagements to be married.\n\n\"I remember going to her church and hearing that hymn 'Rock of Ages.' There is a line \u2014 'Wash me Saviour or I'll die,'\" she recalled. \"I knew at that moment that I needed a savior. My life was transformed immediately. The Lord radically transformed my life.\"\n\nNewbell told the audience that Ephesians 2 sums up her testimony.\n\n\"At the beginning it says, 'I was dead following the prince of the power of the air, following the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience. We all live there too in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body in mind, children of wrath.' That was me,\" she told the crowd. \"Verse 4, 'But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which He loved us even when we were dead in our tresspasses made us alive together with Christ.' By grace, I was saved. It was grace that I wasn't looking for, grace that I didn't know that I needed. God miraculously saved me.\n\n\"God takes dead people and gives them resurrection life. That's what He did. He took a dead girl and gave her resurrection life. God radically transformed everything about me, all of me. He transformed my heart and He also transformed my mind. He transformed my worldview.\"\n\nNewbell said that she began to understand that she too, was created in God's image and that realization changed how she viewed \"all people.\"\n\n\"That moment when I started to understand that image of God and that God placed value and dignity into people, that meant that Psalm 139:13 wasn't just something religious people read and talked about but was true that God knit together babies in a mother's womb,\" she asserted. \"That meant that those with disabilities are important and valuable to the Lord and therefore, important and valuable to me.\"\n\nAs she learned more about what was important to the Lord, she began to understand that her views on things like abortion and end-of-life \"didn't fit\" with her new faith.\n\n\"What it meant and what I was learning was that all life mattered to the Lord, all life. From the womb until the day we face Jesus it matters to God. Therefore, it matters to me and it matters to us,\" she proclaimed.\n\nNewbell, who is now an author and director of community outreach for the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, explained that she eventually realized that the kind of love her father was teaching her to have for other people before he passed away when she was 19 was not his idea, but God's idea.\n\n\"When I became a Christian at the age of 22, the Lord became my Father,\" Newbell said. \"I understood what it meant to be fatherless. The Lord helped me see that my desire for equality and the dignity of people made in His image ... was His desire.\"\n\nAlthough two broken engagements were part of what ultimately led Newbell to Christ when she was 22, Newbell explained that her boyfriend that she chose over God when she was 19, Thern Newbell, ended up accepting Christ. The Newbells have been married for 15 years and have two kids.\n\n\"God takes dead people and gives them resurrection life. He reconciled us first to Himself and then to each other,\" she explained. \"Here is what I want you to know. My testimony is radical, if you knew me when I was 19 and in my 20s and how opposed I was to things of the Lord. There are people who are walking around right now who need Jesus. If God can transform my heart and I am speaking here and I work for the ERLC, it's radical and it's ridiculous. He can do that for and with anyone.\"\n\nThe Evangelicals for Life conference kicked off Thursday and is being hosted by the ERLC. Newbell's testimony was delivered just before the March for Life.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/former-pro-choice-atheist-tells-evangelicals-for-life-how-god-transformed-her-214428/"}

Despite the fact that the memo has yet to be publicly released and the contents remain unknown, media figures such as Sean Hannity have attacked left-leaning government officials for their overreach and abuse of power, calling for Mueller to end his \u201cwitch hunt\u201d investigation.\n\nHowever, as Trump advocates provide little evidence to back up their claims, the reality of collusion and meddling of Russian officials in the 2016 elections becomes more apparent by the day. One aspect of Russian interference has been seen through the establishment of social media accounts as a means of spreading propaganda to influence the outcome of the presidential elections. On Friday, online platform Twitter stated that they had identified and suspended 1,062 accounts on their site, which they found to be directly related to the Internet Research Agency, a well-known Russian-linked content distributor.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. is tweeting the same hashtag as Russia-linked Twitter accounts. Coincidence? https://t.co/6uroraKF45 \u2014 Renato Mariotti (@renato_mariotti) January 19, 2018\n\nThe new suspensions by Twitter brought the grand total of Internet Research Agency-linked accounts to 3,814, comprising of 175,993 tweets that were published during the presidential race. Aside from the individual accounts that were used to disseminate propaganda during the elections, Twitter stated that they identified another 13,512 Russia-linked bot accounts, all of which published tweets and promoted information that directly influenced the outcome of the 2016 election campaigns.\n\nIn their attempt to identify these issues and maintain transparency with platform users, Twitter announced an outreach that would inform individuals of the Russian-linked content they may have viewed. In doing so, Twitter outlined in a statement that,\n\n\u2018Consistent with our commitment to transparency, we are emailing notifications to 677,775 people in the United States who followed one of these accounts or retweeted or liked a Tweet from these accounts during the election period. Because we have already suspended these accounts, the relevant content on Twitter is no longer publicly available.\u2019\n\nTwitter\u2019s statement goes on to depict various images and posts that were published by the Kremlin-linked accounts, in order to provide context for the content that was distributed. Since learning of the gaps within their platform, and the ability of foreign agents to capitalize on such openings, Twitter said that it is working to ensure that these kinds of manipulative strategies can no longer take place.\n\nThe discovery of new Russian-linked accounts comes just days after Twitter representatives testified in front of the Senate Commerce Committee, which took place earlier this week. The focus of the hearing itself was targeted towards the use of Twitter byextremists in promoting propaganda and garnering support for their detrimental causes, but also touched on the various shortcomings within the platform that allowed Russian influence to become a factor in the election process.\n\nI've been tough with Twitter on this, but I'm encouraged to see the company beginning to take responsibility and notify its users of Russia's influence campaign on its platform. https://t.co/abAdbHWatI \u2014 Mark Warner (@MarkWarner) January 19, 2018\n\nLawmakers grilled Twitter for the gaps in their software, questioning whether their platform is causing the U.S. democracy to become more susceptible to attacks. Nevertheless, as Twitter continues to crackdown on the misuse of their platform, more evidence surrounding the Russia investigation is coming to light.\n\nFeatured Image by Getty Images", "domain": "bipartisanreport.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://bipartisanreport.com/2018/01/19/gop-conspiracy-movement-about-the-memo-just-got-derailed-humiliated/"}

However, as Trump has shown since his ventures into the political field, there is no limit to the surprises he has in store.\n\nHis most recent controversy came during a closed door meeting, wherein he referred to various impoverished countries as \u201csh*thole countries\u201d, and asking why the United States accepts immigrants from these nations to begin with. One specific country that was mentioned among them was that of Haiti, which has been stricken with an array of natural disasters that left devastation in their wake. Yet, as activists have shown time and time again since Trump\u2019s taking of power, such speech and ignorant remarks will not go unanswered.\n\nOn Friday, hundreds of Haitian natives and Haitian-Americans organized in front of Trump Tower in New York, protesting their distaste of the president\u2019s hateful comments. Although Trump himself was not in New York during the time of the protest, the chants and slogans of these Haitian individuals was heard around the country. According to the New York Daily News,\n\n\u2018Hundreds of Haitians marched from the Brooklyn Bridge to Trump Tower Friday in protest of the President\u2019s derogatory comments about their homeland. Waving Haitian flags and dancing to the beat of drums and horns, the number of demonstrators multiplied as they streamed into Midtown.\u2019\n\nToday, the Haitian community marched across the Brooklyn Bridge to protest Trump's racist remarks about immigrants. Also, I was there, and it was my first time walking across the bridge after living in Brooklyn for a year! https://t.co/3HEdJrchpG pic.twitter.com/XODcHlalyU \u2014 Paul Stremple (@paulstremple) January 20, 2018\n\nTrump\u2019s latest comments not only infuriated the migrants from the countries in question, as well as lawmakers on the other side of the aisle, but also many members of his own party. Almost immediately after the news broke of what the president said, numerous GOP representatives spoke against the nature of his rhetoric, outlining that the things that came out of his mouth was not indicative of the American way.\n\nRep. Mia Love (R-U.T.), herself a Haitian-American, was outraged at the inability of the president to understand the circumstances and external forces at play, and the inherent struggles that such migrants have to deal with on a daily basis.\n\nThose who were also involved in the meeting also mentioned Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who was reportedly seated close to the president in the meeting, as criticizing Trump immediately after the comments were made, fighting back against the uninformed remarks.\n\nTrump continues to deny making the remarks, despite the fact that a wide array of individuals sitting in on the meeting, both Republican and Democrat, affirmed the accuracy of the distasteful comments. As Trump continues to marginalize minority groups in the country, it is evident that an even greater number of his own base are turning against him as well.\n\nNever said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said \u201ctake them out.\u201d Made up by Dems. I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians. Probably should record future meetings \u2013 unfortunately, no trust! \u2014 Donald J.

People cannot find one of the lady\u2019s legs! And it is driving a lot of people crazy.\n\nBrain teasers are all the rage right now. And since you\u2019re sitting at your computer or looking at your phone, then you\u2019re in just the right place to play with this image. While these six women are all in the image, all their limbs appear not to be.\n\nThis viral image came into popularity after it was posted to Reddit a while back. And now it is making a resurgence.\n\nThe girls in the photo were the original ones to notice the case of the missing legs. If you take a close look, you\u2019ll only see five pairs of legs while there are six women in the image.\n\nThe women themselves were surprised to see the phantom legs missing. Where did they go? And how could they not appear in the image?\n\nJust so you know, and there are no questions from you, each of these six women have two arms and two legs each. So that is not the reason there are only five pairs of legs in the picture.\n\nSo which woman is the culprit? It\u2019s the one who is the third from the left. She appears to be entirely without legs. You see it, right?\n\nYou should also know something special about this picture. The six women in the image did not purposely pose this way to make it an optical illusion image. This happened by accident and was completely random. And that makes it all the more unsettling. It was just a perfectly executed image that was to go on to become one of the best viral pictures ever.\n\nWhen the image as posted to Reddit, it went viral almost immediately. The comment section exploded with questions, and others tried to provide answers. But it is still confusing, and people just don\u2019t know where that missing pair of legs went.\n\nSome people believe the legs were hiding in plain sight. Perhaps the women third from the left has her legs spread wide, and the other two women on either side of her have their legs up and over them.\n\nThis image was so perplexing some internet gurus took it upon themselves to figure out the truth.

And no place is as fun for a dog to go than the forest or the park.

They get some exercise, and the owners get to see their best friends having some fun.\n\nWhen dogs get off the leash, they love to run around and have fun.

The March for Life is a movement born out of love. You love your families, you love your neighbors, you love our nation, and you love every child, born and unborn, because you believe that every life is sacred, that every child is a precious gift from God.\n\n\"Because of you, tens of thousands of Americans have been born and reached their full God-given potential.\"\n\nExpand | Collapse (Screenshot: March for Life) Tens of thousands of people gather at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., for the 45th Annual March for Life, Jan. 19, 2018.\n\nDuring his remarks, Trump touted his pro-life efforts as president, including the reinstituting of the Mexico City Policy, which bans the government funding of abortions overseas, and reversing an Obama-era policy that made it hard for state governments to defund Planned Parenthood. Most recently, his administration issued a new proposal to protect conscience rights of medical professionals.\n\nNoting that the United States is one of seven countries that allows elective abortions after 20 weeks, Trump also denounced such abortions as \"wrong\" and that \"it has to change.\"\n\n\"We are protecting the sanctity of life and the family as the foundation of our society, but this movement can only succeed with the heart, the soul, and the prayer of the people,\" added Trump, who called life \"the greatest miracle of all.\"\n\nHe ended, \"We are with you all the way.\"\n\nVice President Mike Pence, who spoke in person at the 2017 March for Life, gave introductory remarks wherein he called Trump \"the most pro-life president in American history.\"\n\n\"From preventing taxpayer dollars from funding abortion overseas to empowering states to respect life in Title X, to nominating judges who will uphold our God-given liberties enshrined in the Constitution of the United States, this president has been a tireless defender of life and conscience in America,\" stated Pence.\n\n\"And know, as you march for life, that your compassion, your persistence, your activism and your prayers are saving lives. And this pro-life generation should never doubt we are with you, this president stands with you, and He who said 'Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you,' is with you as well.\"\n\nTrump's remarks came as part of the 45th anniversary March for Life, the large annual rally at the District of Columbia held on or around the anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court decision, Roe v. Wade.\n\nThis year's theme for the March for Life was \"Love Saves Lives,\" which March for Life President Jeanne Mancini stated last October was the fundamental premise of the pro-life movement.\n\n\"Choosing life is not always easy, but it is the loving, empowering, and self-sacrificial option. Love is universally attractive because it is directed towards others,\" stated Mancini.\n\n\"Love is what we all strive for because deep-down we are all drawn to give of ourselves in this way.

The Home Office is simply incorrect to claim that non-religious people seeking asylum don't get the same protection in law as religious people do.\"\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said in response to the story: \"The U.K. has a proud history of granting asylum to those who need our protection and each claim is carefully considered on its individual merits.\"\n\nChristians converts from Islam, who also face heavy persecution in their own countries, have complained in similar cases of being rejected asylum in the U.K. for failing to answer questions on the Bible.\n\nOne Iranian convert to Christianity, identified as Mohammed, said in 2016 that his failure to answer Bible trivia does not mean he does not believe in the faith.\n\n\"One question they asked me was very strange \u2014 what color was the cover of the Bible,\" he said. \"I knew there were different colors.

Fallon) People protest Donald Trump's travel ban from Muslim majority countries at the International terminal at Los Angeles International Airport in Los Angeles, California, January 28, 2017.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to decide the legality of President Trump's latest temporary travel ban targeting six Muslim-majority countries.\n\nThe Supreme Court is due to hear arguments in April and issue a ruling by the end of June on whether the policy violates federal immigration law or the U.S. Constitution's prohibition on religious discrimination. Trump's policy, announced in September, blocks entry into the United States of most people from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.\n\nThe legal fight involves the third version of a contentious policy Trump first sought to implement a week after taking office in January 2017.\n\nThe Supreme Court, which is handling a series of closely watched cases, signaled on Dec. 4 it was likely to uphold the ban when, on a 7-2 vote, it let it go into full effect while legal challenges by the state of Hawaii and others continued. Lower courts had partially blocked the ban.\n\nThe president has said the policy is needed to protect the United States from terrorism by Islamic militants.\n\nThose challenging the policy have argued it was motivated by Trump's enmity toward Muslims, pressing that point in court with some success by citing statements he made as a candidate and as president.\n\nAs a candidate, Trump promised \"a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\" As president, he has rescinded protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants who were brought into the country illegally as children and sought to ramp up deportations.\n\nImmigration arrests have tripled since January 2017 to an average of 142 people a day, though actual deportations are down from the rate under Trump's Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.\n\n\"We have always known this case would ultimately be decided by the United States Supreme Court. This will be an important day for justice and the rule of law. We look forward to the court hearing the case,\" said Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin, a Democrat.\n\nA Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nThe ACLU pursued a separate legal challenge in Maryland that is now before the Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n\"The Supreme Court can and should put a definitive end to President Trump's attempt to undermine the constitutional guarantee of religious equality and the basic principles of our immigration laws, including their prohibition of national origin discrimination,\" ACLU lawyer Omar Jadwat said.\n\n'THE NATION'S INTEREST'\n\nThe case represents a high-profile test of presidential powers. In court papers, U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco, arguing for the Trump administration, said the president has \"broad authority to suspend or restrict the entry of aliens outside the United States when he deems it in the nation's interest.\"\n\nThe latest ban was introduced on Sept. 24 after what Francisco called an \"extensive, worldwide review\" to determine which foreign governments provide information required by the United States to vet those seeking entry. The countries on the list are those that do not share that information or present \"other heightened risk factors,\" Francisco said.\n\nHawaii's lead lawyer Neal Katyal said in court papers that the president has only limited authority to exclude entry of people from other countries.\n\nUnder a U.S. law called the Immigration and Nationality Act, a president can restrict entry only of those deemed a potential threat or in certain emergency situations. The law also prohibits discrimination on the basis of nationality.\n\nThe law does not \"surrender to the president a boundless authority to set the rules of entry and override the immigration laws at will,\" Katyal said in court papers.\n\nTrump's ban also covers people from North Korea and certain government officials from Venezuela, but lower courts had already allowed those provisions to go into effect.\n\nAlthough lower courts have ruled against Trump over this three travel bans, the Supreme Court has given him a friendlier reception.\n\nIn a series of emergency actions, it has issued decisions at least in part favorable to Trump without ever resolving the legal merit of the policies.\n\nThe justices in June revived parts of Trump's second ban he signed in March.\n\nThere are some exceptions to Trump's most recent ban. Certain people from each targeted country can apply for a visa for tourism, business or education purposes, and any applicant can ask for an individual waiver.\n\nFor people from the eight Muslim-majority countries named in any of Trump's three bans, there was a 41 percent drop in visas granted to enter the United States last year compared to before the bans were announced, government data showed.\n\nCourts in Seattle and Maryland ruled the current ban unlawful, prompting the administration to appeal. Before the Supreme Court's December order, the lower courts had allowed the ban to go into effect for those with no close relatives in the United States or \"formal, documented\" relationships with U.S.-based entities such as universities and resettlement agencies.\n\nReporting by Lawrence Hurley.

The family-friendly movie centers around country music star Liam Page (Alex Roe) who returns home after leaving the love of his life, Josie Preston, (Jessica Rothe) at the altar with an unborn child that he knew nothing about.\n\nAfter eight years of pursuing a lifestyle of fame and fortune, Liam returns to his small Louisiana hometown to face his former fianc\u00e9, his pastor-father, and the daughter he never knew about.\n\nShowcasing faith-based elements in \"Forever My Girl\" was a different experience for producers Mickey Liddell and Pete Shilaimon who previously worked on the 2016 historical biblical drama \"Risen.\"\n\nAlthough Christian values are woven into almost every scene, producer Liddell spoke to The Christian Post about being intentional with the subtleties of the Christian messages.\n\n\"I think the idea of Jesus in this situation in this hometown, you can feel it without hitting people over the head. You feel peace, forgiveness, all of the things,\" he said. \"To me I would love people to have more feeling when they leave than say, 'John 3:16' or whatever. It's hard to take that into an entertaining movie.\n\n\"The themes here are Christian in the way that they really feel with family.\"\n\nThey may not be overt, but some faith-based messages like the importance of forgiveness are clear in scenes like Pastor Brian (John Benjamin Hickey) preaching on the topic to his congregation. The pastor is able to share a number of sermons throughout the film, but the three-dimensional character also deals with relatable struggles when he leaves the pulpit that Liddell hopes can touch audiences in a deeper way.\n\n\"We were trying to make sure that even with the church and the pastor that he was three-dimensional and real and wasn't someone on the pulpit that said these things and then left without struggles of his own. Obviously, he had struggles,\" Liddell told CP. \"The most powerful [parts of] spiritual films to me are the messages. I can't tell you exactly what they said but I know that feeling.\"\n\nEven though Roe plays Liam in the film, the actor mentioned the pastor as one of the movie's characters that best exemplifies what it means to be human.\n\n\"He's the town pastor in the movie and he's got all of these words for his congregation, these words to help them out and these words of inspiration,\" the actor said in a roundtable discussion with CP. \"I've spoken to a pastor since who has said that it's difficult to be the pastor at home. It is a really humanizing aspect of that character.\"\n\nUnlike the countless romance films that have come before it, \"Forever My Girl\" doesn't tell the story of a woman trying to win the affections of a man. After Josie was jilted at the altar by Liam, her life did not stop or revolve around him.\n\nFor Rothe, the actress who portrays Josie in the film, based on the Heidi McLaughlin book of the same name, the leading female character represents strength for women.\n\n\"It's actually one of the things that makes this film so unique as a rom-com or romantic film, however you want to look at it. Often times it's the woman chasing the man trying to prove that she's good enough, or worth enough,\" she said. \"I was so drawn to this character because that is a lesson I know that I have to continually learn not only to have inner strength and know your own worth, but to trust that people see that. I think it's very important for young women, young people and older people as well, to know that love is important, but it's also important to find a partner who respects you and loves you the way you deserve to be treated.\"\n\nFaith, family, forgiveness and love are all central themes in the movie, but country music serves as the heartbeat that ties everything together. More than just a second thought featured as a film score, country music artists Jackson Odell and Brett Boyett wrote songs to complement Liam's journey.\n\nFor months, British actor Roe studied the genre and culture that resulted in him singing, playing guitar and speaking with an accent that would fit right into the country music industry. Roe explained how the film's themes pair well with those found in country music.\n\n\"I think that, in my research anyway, country music seems to be grounded in people staying true to their roots, being homegrown and being honest storytellers. Both the country fans really admire that in the artists they follow, and the artists admire that in their following,\" the actor told CP. \"I think that this being a story of coming home in some way and retracing those roots, that's a really important highlight in the country music scene, the country music fans, and the country music artists.\"\n\n\"Forever My Girl\" is in theaters Friday.

It's not.\"\n\nA Christian mother and three of her daughters in Nigeria's in Kano state recently faced various forms of abuse for their refusal to convert to Islam and follow in the footsteps of the father, who became a Muslim for a government position.\n\n\"They summoned me and demanded I withdraw my daughter from the Christian school, bring her back to the village, and hand her over to them. Since I was helpless, I did as instructed by them and brought my daughter back to them,\" the mother said, according to Morning Star News.\n\nThe mother and oldest daughter were arrested in March 2017, but local Christian leaders managed to bail them out.\n\nTwo of her other young daughters, aged six and 15, have also been harassed for their faith.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/nigerian-student-arrested-christian-university-converting-from-islam-to-christianity-214533/"}

It seems they are working to create awareness on a whole new level.\n\nThe new docuseries \u2018Rotten\u2018 reveals tons and tons of heartbreaking and unsavory truths about the food supply chain. The things in the episodes of this series shape the meals that end up on our dinner table. Whether you are aware or not you can be, we should all take the time to check out this revealing series. Our food supply system is broke, inhumane, and overwhelmed with fraud.\n\nThis new series is essentially a true crime series. It will contain many stories some of which you may be aware of and others you most certainly will not be. This series has been produced by Zero Point Zero which is a company behind many of Anthony Bourdain\u2019s ventures. As you may know last year Netflix brought us \u2018Wasted\u2019 which was a documentary about food waste and if you have not yet I also suggest that you check it out as well.\n\nIndieWire reported as follows in regards to this new series:\n\nThese stories aren\u2019t restricted merely to one section of America or the globe, incorporating stories and interests ranging from the California Central Valley to the peanut farms of Georgia, from rice fields in China to meat processing plants in Brazil. Uniting these disparate corners of the globe under the banner of a single food not only underlines the commonalities between various cuisines, it puts a hole in the theory that international trade can be \u201csolved\u201d by strong posturing or tough talk. If an hour-long installment can barely scratch the surface of the intricacies of the global honey trade, it puts the challenges of a shifting global landscape in further relief.\n\nBut regardless of where this food is coming from, another common theme of \u201cRotten\u201d is that literal and figurative appetites are becoming less sustainable by the year. The series doesn\u2019t get too mired in a sea of statistics, but through shots of massive storerooms and quick global map graphics, \u201cRotten\u201d is as concerned with the challenges and consequences of volume as many of these industry food producers are.\n\nWasted was full of things that most people are not quite aware of. I am hoping that Rotten follows down the same path that Wasted did and really pushes more people to become aware. You can check Rotten out for yourself on Netflix now as it was released just the other day. I have been unable to take my eyes off of it, to say the least. The first installment is titled \u201cLawyers, Guns, and Honey,\u201d it intends to explore the new global honey business and easily one of the largest food fraud investigations and prosecutions in history.

What if you could use turmeric to cure cancer?\n\nFor those who do not know, turmeric is a yellow curry spice that is used in lots of Indian cuisines. That being said, it also has a history of being used in traditional Chinese medicine. It is commonly used to treat everything from liver disease to sprained muscles.\n\nCurcumin is a derivative of turmeric and makes up the pigment that gives turmeric its color and it is also something that has been researched quite extensively. Curcumin is useful for just about every single kind of cancer. It promotes healthy cell function and destroys cancer cells.\n\nCurcumin has the ability to modulate genetic activity and expression. It seems to use a number of mechanisms to convince the cancer cells to essentially kill themselves. It is believed that because of how many different ways this works against cancer that resistance to it is not as possible as it is with some chemotherapy treatments.\n\nAmong the most exciting benefits of turmeric is its potent anti-cancer activity.18,19 Curcumin actually has the most evidence-based literature20 supporting its use against cancer of any other nutrient, including vitamin D! As noted by Dr. William LaValley\u2014one of the leading natural medicine cancer physicians whom I\u2019ve previously interviewed on this topic\u2014curcumin is unique in that it appears to be universally useful for just about every type of cancer. This is odd, considering the fact that cancer consists of a wide variety of different molecular pathologies. One reason for this universal anti-cancer proclivity is curcumin\u2019s ability to affect multiple molecular targets, via multiple pathways.\n\nOnce it gets into a cell, it affects more than 100 different molecular pathways. And, as explained by Dr. LaValley, whether the curcumin molecule causes an increase in activity of a particular molecular target, or decrease/inhibition of activity, studies repeatedly show that the end result is a potent anti-cancer activity. Moreover, curcumin is non-toxic, and does not adversely affect healthy cells, suggesting it selectively targets cancer cells\u2014all of which are clear benefits in cancer treatment. Research has even shown that it works synergistically with certain chemotherapy drugs, enhancing the elimination of cancer cells.\n\nWhat do you think about all of this?

He says social media is tearing society apart. He says bad actors can now manipulate large swaths of people to do anything they want them to. The goal was to get people hooked and that was exactly what happened.\n\nThat being said, he has not been the only person to speak out. Former Google engineer Tristan Harris even went so far as to tell 60 Minutes that companies like Google have a whole playbook of techniques to keep people as glued to their apps as possible. There are clear downsides to the social media age we are currently in.\n\nThe more you know the more you can do to work against it. While you don\u2019t have to delete your Facebook and swear off of cell phones, you should be cutting back and noting these things so that you can be on the lookout for them. To hear some of these people speak please check out the video below. They seem to have quite a lot to say and deserve to be heard.\n\n\ufeff\n\nImage via Bad Chix", "domain": "awarenessact.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://awarenessact.com/the-dark-side-of-social-media-as-revealed-by-former-high-ranking-officials/"}

Earlier today, after much debate and deliberation, the two parties found a deal that seemed feasible to each, allowing the government to resume operations.\n\nHowever, as has been the case with the majority of recent initiatives, President Donald Trump has yet again attempted to mislead the general public in a recent tweet published earlier tonight. In doing so, Trump proclaimed a victory for Republicans in the negotiations, overtly stating that the Democrats caved to the GOP and his administration.\n\nBig win for Republicans as Democrats cave on Shutdown. Now I want a big win for everyone, including Republicans, Democrats and DACA, but especially for our Great Military and Border Security. Should be able to get there. See you at the negotiating table! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 23, 2018\n\nYet, the lack of context and perspective that the president consistently fails to provide is evident in this tweet, as anybody who actually did research into the agreement would understand that no such \u201cbig win\u201d was had. The deal to end the government shutdown was agreed to only after the Republicans conceded a major immigration-related issue to the Democrats. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, along with other ranking Republican members, agreed that the vote on DACA, when it comes to the Senate, will not need to be signed off by Trump, significantly decreasing the president\u2019s influence or leverage over the forthcoming immigration policy.\n\nI expect @SenateMajLdr to fulfill his commitment to the Senate & abide by this agreement. If he does not honor our agreement, he will have breached the trust of not only the Democratic Senators but the members of his own party as well. \u2014 Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) January 22, 2018\n\nThe GOP Majority now has 17 days to prevent #Dreamers from being deported. In every possible way, urge your Senators to vote yes on our bipartisan compromise to #ProtectDreamers when it comes to the floor. \u2014 Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) January 22, 2018\n\nIf the GOP fails to remain steadfast in their commitment to find a bipartisan solution to the DACA and other immigration-related issues, the Democrats have another failsafe in the February 8th vote that, again, is needed to keep the government funded. Despite the fact that President Trump believes the deal to be a sign of weakness by the Democrats, and a victory for Republicans, the reality is that any win, for either side, has yet to inherently be had. Considering the fact that both sides need to come to an agreement on immigration by February 8th, and Democrats committing to protect DACA recipients, it is likely that the bipartisan policy will pass without the requirement of Trump\u2019s approval.\n\nSo, contrary to his tweet, perhaps President Trump will not be seeing anybody at the negotiation table.\n\nFeatured Image by Getty Images", "domain": "bipartisanreport.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://bipartisanreport.com/2018/01/23/trump-flies-into-shutdown-victory-rant-at-midnight-like-a-childish-old-drunk/"}

When presented with clear facts about his failures, he becomes more impassioned to espouse his own prowess on little-to-no evidence. Well, it is clear that those surrounding Trump are similar in their misunderstanding of reality, and it has become evident that the apple, truly, does not fall too far from the tree.\n\nAs each day passes, Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s similarity to his father in lacking any shred of realism is made apparent. Earlier today, Trump Jr. posted a meme on Twitter, implying some form of a win that the administration achieved, despite not providing any context as to what he was talking about.\n\nPerhaps Trump Jr. doesn\u2019t yet understand what a \u201cwin\u201d actually consists of. It is likely that he was referring to the reopening of government operations after the three-day shutdown, which, in reality, Democrats claim to have worked in their favor. Or maybe he is referring to the reactions of large corporations, such as Apple and Walmart, in pledging that they will provide greater benefits for American workers and increase their investments back to the United States after the passing of the GOP tax bill. Well, given that Trump Jr. rubs elbows and considers himself among these corporate elites, he fails to understand the many deceptions and lies that these \u201cpledges\u201d often amount to, and the fact that there is no accountability if they decide to go back on their word.\n\nMany on Twitter were quick to criticize Trump Jr.\u2019s laughable attempt to claim a win for the administration, making a mockery of his irrelevant post:\n\nactually he hasn't won a single meaningful thing since he took office.

Not only is it fun to take a look at they can also reportedly improve your cognitive abilities. And with the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s for thousands of Americans, this is a great alternative. Below we\u2019re sharing a puzzle that asks you to find 6 hidden words in the picture. Can you do it? Give it a shot because if you can, you\u2019re more observant than 90% of American adults who tried to figure out this puzzle\u2026\n\nIn the image below, you\u2019ll see a cartoon drawing of two children playing in their family living room. The boy is building what appears to be a fort while his sister is running to join him. The family cat watches contentedly from the side as the kids joyfully play.\n\nIn the image, six words are hidden in plain sight. Are you able to find them all?\n\nScroll down to the bottom if you\u2019re eager to get started and test your brain power. But if you\u2019re interested in learning more about how puzzles like this boost your cognitive abilities, stick with us. We have some compelling information to share\u2026\n\nWant more tips to make you smarter? Here you go!\n\nWhile games and puzzles are a great way to keep your brain engaged on a productive activity, they are not the only way to keep your mind sharp as you get older.\n\nAccording to cognitive neuroscientist Sandra Bond Chapman Ph.D. in her blog on Psychology Today, you can improve your brain health with a few other simple tricks.\n\nFirst, stop multitasking. Research proves that your brain can only do one thing at a time. When you shift between tasks you\u2019re weakening your brain power. Your mind needs to adapt to the new task before it can efficiently complete it. Multitasking, distractions, and notifications, make it harder for our brains to do their job. Multitasking \u201cactually overloads and fatigues the brain, making it less efficient,\u201d Dr. Chapman said.\n\nDr. Chapman also went on to suggest that cutting ties from technology altogether goes a long way in improving your cognitive abilities. Even if you just turn off your phone or tablet for 30 minutes, you can reap the benefits. Quiet can really help your brain get deeper into a task.\n\nThe cognitive neuroscientist also suggest in her blog on Psychology Today, that you should focus on thinking deeper. Instead of \u201csurface-level, uninspired thinking \u2026 challenge your mind to think in themes, which will strengthen connections between different areas of our brain\u2026 Our brains become quickly jaded by routine so push past the predictable to better your brain health across the lifespan.\u201d\n\nKeeping your brain sharp is important for you. Nothing is more demoralizing than the thought of losing your mental sharpness as you age. While puzzles can help a little bit, try to eliminate multitasking, disconnect from technology every day, and think deeper for optimal brain health.\n\nPlease SHARE THIS PUZZLE with your friends and family on Facebook today!", "domain": "awm.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://awm.com/so-far-no-one-we-asked-could-find-all-6-hidden-words-in-this-image-do-you-think-you-can-try-here-9/"}

Dean Fisher and 11 other Republicans this week introduced House File 2031, which would direct the state Department of Education to prepare material and teacher training for a high school elective course that focuses on the Hebrew Scriptures and the Bible's New Testament.\n\n\"Basically, I want to give students the opportunity to study the Bible from the perspective of its impact on history and culture,\" Des Moines Register quoted Fisher as saying.\n\n\"Beyond its literary and cultural significance, which is significant, the Bible is also an essential thread of the American consciousness, and without it, American unity is unraveling,\" Drew Zahn, spokesman for The Family Leader, was quoted as saying.\n\nHowever, some parents are reportedly concerned.\n\n\"We have that separation of church and state that was intentionally put in there as a first amendment and so it to me it wasn't even something that's lawful.

Faber stated that \"Supreme Court jurisprudence has by no means established an absolute bar to the Bible being taught and studied in the public school system.\"\n\nArizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas are among the states that have similar laws allowing Bible courses to be taught in public schools.\n\nIn June last year, Kentucky's Republican Christian Gov. Matt Bevin signed a bill allowing public schools to teach a course on the Bible.\n\n\"The idea that we would not want this to be an option for people in school, that would be crazy. I don't know why every state would not embrace this, why we as a nation would not embrace this,\" Bevin said at the time.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/iowa-may-be-next-state-offer-bible-classes-public-schools-214526/"}

In an attempt to remedy the situation, the company reportedly issued a statement that asked retailers to put the gamers' needs first.\n\nNvidia's Boris B\u00f6hles told the German publication ComputerBase (translated by Wccftech): \"For NVIDIA, gamers come first. All activities related to our GeForce product line are targeted at our main audience. To ensure that GeForce gamers continue to have good GeForce graphics card availability in the current situation, we recommend that our trading partners make the appropriate arrangements to meet gamers' needs as usual.\"\n\nGamers may recall that Nvidia usually limits the purchase of graphics cards via its official online store to two units per customer, and this is likely the selling recommendation that the company implied.\n\nHowever, the company cannot control the units being sold to buyers unless the purchase is made through its website.\n\nWhile the company appeared to have not directly referred to cryptocurrency miners, reports have linked Nvidia's appeal to retailers to this angle.\n\nIt can be recalled in 2017, Motherboard reported that the months-long graphics cards drought could be linked to crypto miners who might be hoarding the hardware. It was learned that graphics cards were a great tool for a faster generation of digital currencies like Ethereum and Zcash. And with the rising prices of cryptocurrencies seen last year, Nvidia could have realized that one of the possible reasons for the supply shortage is the overbuying of its products by miners.\n\nApart from the difficulty of looking for a graphics card, gamers desperate to upgrade their rig were also met with prices that were practically double the original cost. For example, the cheapest price for a GeForce GTX 1070 Ti on Newegg is $899.99 -- a huge spike from its base price of $449 through Nvidia.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/nvidia-graphics-card-supply-shortage-company-asks-retailers-to-prioritize-gamers-214798/"}

Ultimately, Liam will nail down the details of their custody agreement. It remains to be seen what Liam's proposal will be, but spoilers tease that his alternative solution won't give Steffy her happily ever after.\n\nThere are speculations that Liam's proposal will involve a compromise, wherein Liam will urge his wife to agree to an annulment before they go any further. Considering what Steffy has done to him, it's possible that Liam will want them to start from scratch as they raise their child together. While he's ready to keep an open mind about their being parents at this point, the story's different when it comes to their being husband and wife.\n\nElsewhere in the episode, Brooke (Katherine Kelly Lang) will confront Bill (Don Diamont) about his betrayal and guts to prey on Steffy's weakness.

His numbers also suggest that he can hit a reasonable amount of those shots.\n\nPachulia and McGee are not quite as effective away from the rim.\n\nKeep in mind too that O'Quinn has put up those shooting numbers with the Knicks. It seems safe to assume that his shooting will improve if he ends up going to the Warriors since he will likely receive more open looks playing alongside Curry, Thompson and Durant.\n\nThe Warriors probably do not need O'Quinn to have a good shot at winning the title this year, but adding him can certainly make them even more formidable.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/nba-trade-rumors-why-the-golden-state-warriors-may-be-interested-in-adding-kyle-oquinn-215048/"}

The sixth book in his \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" novel series has been in development for years, and it should have been released a couple of years ago. However, Martin has only been giving fans vague spoilers about it.\n\nWith fans clueless about when to expect the book to arrive and what to expect from it, they are forced to come up with their own theories about the highly anticipated book. Back in 2011, Martin revealed that he was already working on \"The Winds of Winter,\" so many expected it to arrive sometime in 2015 even without the author giving an exact release date for it.\n\nLast July, Martin addressed rumors that he had already stopped working on the book. He took to his official blog to tell his supporters that it was still in the works, although he still did not mention an exact release date. \"I am still working on it, I am still months away (how many? Good question), I still have good days and bad days, and that's all I care to say,\" he wrote.\n\nLast year, reports surfaced claiming that Martin might release his book in September this year as a surprise to his fans on his 70th birthday.

Shortly after posting the listing, the bookstore deleted the entry and replaced it with \"The Winds of Winter by George R.R. Martin (fingers crossed!),\" removing the date.

While you can\u2019t believe everything you see on the internet, you also can\u2019t just assume everything is fine and dandy. It\u2019s good to question things from time to time, like 4chan users did just a couple days ago!\n\nAs many people may know, a couple days ago Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson airport suffered from a paralyzing power outage of over eleven hours. Being the world\u2019s busiest airport, Hartsfield Jackson was thrown into a complete frenzy when planes were grounded and delayed just after midnight when the power began to flicker away! The power outage left thousands of people stranded in dark terminals and planes sitting idle. All in all, over 1,000 flights were cancelled due to the power disaster. According to officials, the power outage was a result of a fire in a Georgia underground electricity facility. Mayor Kasim Reed said that the fire damaged two substations serving the airport\u2019s redundant system which additionally cut out the backup supply.\n\nAlthough officials report there being a fire, some 4chan users have a different idea as to why the blackout happened. While social media forums tend to get a bit exaggerated when it comes to conspiracies, these users have a compelling theory for the blackout.\n\nWhile the mayor ordered for the grounding of all planes flying out of the Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson airport, the 4chan users claim that there was one plane that was able to leave the airport. They even hypothesize that the entire blackout was designed to hide something. The plane, 4X-ICB, is a cargo plane that landed in Atlanta from New Mexico at 1:00PM, only moments after the power outage began. At 6:27PM the plane mysteriously left the airport. According to Squawker,\n\n\u201cThe cargo plane in question is owned by Cal Cargo Airlines. A Jewish owned company based out of Israel who specializes in the transportation of nonstandard cargo such as, live animals and dangerous goods.\n\nThe company\u2019s leadership also has clear connections to the Israeli government. This includes its Vice Chairman Muli Ravini, who previously served as Assistant to the Director General at the Ministry of Finance in Israel\n\nSo to sum this up so far. An unprecedented power outage occurs at the busiest airport in the world. Despite the airport having backup generators for just this occasion that mysteriously somehow went out at the same time. Minutes before the blackout, a cargo plane from Mexico City arrives at the airport. Due to a special customs arrangement, it is not boarded by security or customs officials. Then approximately 5 hours later, despite all flight having been ordered grounded by both the cities mayor and the FAA, the flight leaves for its next destination.\u201d\n\nCal Airlines interestingly runs another side business titled LACHS. The company does offloading and loading cargo planes at the Atlanta airport. On their website they even more so, brag about their abilities to load and unload planes without a customs agent present. This is extremely interesting and you cannot deny that some things do not add up. Like for example, how does the world\u2019s largest and busiest airport have an eleven hour power failure? Not to mention that the mayor ordered all planes be grounded, yet plane 4X-ICB was able to mysteriously sneak off from the airport? What do you think?

They were working on the investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. 2016 presidential election at the time that they sent their texts.\n\nThen, Page left, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller removed Strzok from the team. Ironically, this move brought them to the attention of 45.\n\nThe NY Daily News reported that the president tweeted:\n\n\u2018In one of the biggest stories in a long time, the FBI says it is now missing five months worth of lovers Strzok \u2013 Page texts, perhaps 50,000, all in prime time. Wow!\u2019\n\nThen, the president tweeted:\n\n\u2018Where are the 50,000 important text messages between FBI lovers Lisa Page and Peter Strzok? Blaming Samsung!\u2019\n\nAfter an extended rant, Trump settled on the South Korean mega-corporation, Samsung, to blame. The Justice Department claimed that the FBI had 50,000 messages on its servers. Last month, the Justice Department released hundreds of the couple\u2019s texts when they were in the midst of their affair.\n\nWhen Mueller discovered that the two had been communicating about Donald Trump in their texts, he removed them from the Russia probe. Many of those texts included negative comments about Trump while the presidential campaign was in full force.\n\nAfter Trump found out about the released texts, he called them a \u201ctreasonous act.\u201d\n\nStrzok had been the lead counterintelligence officer and was also investigated the missing Hillary Clinton emails. The two FBI people did not limit their negative comments to Trump. They also criticized Clinton and other presidential candidates.\n\nThe FBI gave the legislators more texts, but told the lawmakers that a system glitch meant that texts between December 2016 and May 2017 were not stored correctly.\n\nAssistant AG Stephen Boyd reported to Congress how many Samsung 5 mobile devices failed. The NY Daily News reported that he said:\n\n\u2018(To) capture or store text messages due to misconfiguration issues related to rollouts, provisioning and software upgrades that conflicted with the FBI\u2019s collection capabilities.\u2019\n\nSome of the Republicans publicly accused the FBI of deleting them on purpose. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) released the texts that remained available from Strzok and Page on Tuesday. During a Milwaukee radio show, Johnson said that he doubted Mueller\u2019s investigation would find collusion between Moscow and the Trump campaign.\n\nStrzok said:\n\n\u2018You and I both know the odds are nothing. If I thought it was likely, I\u2019d be there no question. I hesitate in part because of my gut sense and concern there\u2019s no big there there.\u2019\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Inspector General\u2019s office will investigate what happened to the missing texts.\n\nTrump tweeted:\n\n\u2018Even Crazy Jim Acosta of Fake News CNN agrees: \u201cTrump World and WH sources dancing in end zone: Trump wins again\u2026Schumer and Dems caved\u2026gambled and lost.\u2019 Thank you for your honesty Jim!\u2019\n\nThe president\u2019s divisive language inspired a Michigan man to phone CNN headquarters and threaten a mass killing, because the network was \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nFeatured Image via Getty Images.", "domain": "bipartisanreport.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://bipartisanreport.com/2018/01/24/trump-goes-on-belligerent-tirade-against-samsung-like-an-unemployed-bored-loser/"}

Hawaii explained on his Twitter account that he couldn\u2019t afford the excess baggage fee after being homeless in Iceland for a week.\n\nThe Icelandic news site Mbl. reported that the airline excluded Hawaii from the flight due to a rude attitude, calling airport security after he refused to leave the airline\u2019s desk.\n\nHawaii posted a video to his Twitter account in which airport security can been heard asking if the police need to be called, as he continues to ask why he cannot board his flight.\n\nHawaii later tweeted that upon the arrival of the police, he was arrested, maced, and held down because of his refusal to leave. Hawaii claims he retained a polite demeanor throughout the entire incident.\n\nHawaii was returned to the airport to catch a flight he booked through EasyJet for the following day, after detailing his version of events at a local police station.\n\nThough he made it through check-in and security, once at the gate, Hawaii says he was once again denied boarding because of the previous day\u2019s incident. According to a message Hawaii received from EasyJet, the captain of his second flight was made aware of the incident and made the call to offload Hawaii from his flight.\n\nIn response, Hawaii posted to Twitter: \u201cAnd AGAIN! Refused from 2 flights in 2 days for no valid reason.\u201d\n\nHawaii was then stuck in Iceland with neither money nor his luggage, which had previously returned to the UK without him, reported Mlb. Ultimately, Hawaii was able to return home on a flight with a Norwegian airline.\n\nSpeaking about the incident, Hawaii said: \u201cI waited in the queue politely with other passengers and once I made it to the desk I was still refused my boarding pass.\n\n\u201cSecurity were called. At this point I started to film. Security tried to slap my phone out my hand.\n\n\u201cI moved. Continued to film and explain that I was well within my rights. Police were called. I spoke to two police officers and explained my story.\u201d\n\nBoth British Airways and EasyJet refunded Hawaii\u2019s flight costs after he opened up communication with the airlines about his experiences. According to Hawaii\u2019s tweets, he believes his refusal from the flights may have been a result of racial profiling.\n\nBritish Airways refute that their actions were racially motivated. A spokesperson for the airline said: \u201cThe decision to deny boarding was absolutely not based on race.

If there\u2019s anything all the die-hard fans will remind you to never forget while playing, it\u2019s to never throw your money away purchasing vowels.\n\nUnfortunately for last night\u2019s winner Lisa, she didn\u2019t get the memo, or at least didn\u2019t manage to follow through on this basic principle. To the surprise and disappointment of experienced viewers, she went against standard strategy and wasted her money on a useless vowel, undoubtedly leaving many watching shaking their heads.\n\nWith the last puzzle filled in to \u201cPEPPE_ _NI PINEAPPLE PI_ _ A\u201d, the solution already seemed clear to most who were tuning in. Despite the answer staring her in the face, Lisa played it safe and bought an \u201cR\u201d to be double-extra-sure the first word was, in fact, the popular type of cured meat and pizza topping. With the prospect of owning a new Mini Cooper obscuring her focus and possibly blurring her vision, Lisa spent $250 on an \u201cO,\u201d then immediately finished the puzzle. With only one other vowel to choose from, Lisa seemed to overlook the absence of the word \u201cpepperuni\u201d in the English language, and threw away her cash on the unnecessary vowel, while many palms met many faces.\n\nThough she did end up solving the \u2013 mostly complete \u2013 puzzle, and winning her slick new car, fans found it hard to watch someone thoughtlessly torch $250: well, that is a lot of gas money.\n\nWhile most can imagine and empathize with the anxieties of being on live television, some seasoned fans were not impressed. On Twitter, \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d viewers dragged out their criticisms of Lisa\u2019s vowel blunder, but she probably isn\u2019t minding the heat behind the wheel of her new Mini.\n\nWith the show\u2019s long history, there have been no shortage of cringe-worthy moments. In March of last year, contestant Kevin reimagined the plot of Tennessee Williams\u2019 famous play, when he incorrectly \u2013 and crudely \u2013 guessed \u201cK\u201d as his final letter in an attempt to complete the phrase: \u201cA STREETCAR NA_ED DESIRE,\u201d much to the amusement of social media users.\n\n\u201cWheel Of Fortune\u201d strategists often wince at overzealous vowel-buying, as many puzzles can be correctly solved without all the vowels being purchased. That being said, if you can manage to make in on the show and win a new car, no one can be too critical of your methods.\n\nTo any hopeful \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d contestants reading, hopefully you can learn from Lisa\u2019s mistake and avoid buying any vowels you don\u2019t need, but if you do happen to crack under pressure, you may want to avoid social media for a few days, or at least the #WheelOfFortune hashtag.\n\n(If feel the need to relive Lisa\u2019s fail, you can check out a clip below.)", "domain": "awm.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://awm.com/wheel-of-fortune-fans-are-losing-their-cool-over-contestants-mistake-video/"}

Trump requested the assessment after this month's publication of Michael Wolff's Fire and Fury alleged he is not mentally fit for office.\n\nJackson explained that he had \"no intention\" of performing the screening because he sees the president several times a day and had \"absolutely no concerns about his cognitive ability and neurological function.\"\n\n(Photo: REUTERS/Carlos Barria) White House, Presidential physician Ronny Jackson answers question about U.S. President Donald Trump's health after the president's annual physical during the daily briefing at the White House in Washington, D.C., January 16, 2018.\n\nThe president scored 30 out of 30 on the mental assessment, and Jackson said the president is \"very sharp.\"\n\nJackson did, however, say that Trump needs to lose 10 to 15 pounds this year and eat fewer carbohydrates. He also said the president is taking a medication to lower his cholesterol, Propecia for hair loss, and a medication to treat rosacea.\n\nMSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" co-host Joe Scarborough, a former friend of Trump's who's now a frequent critic and has claimed that the president has dementia, is now disputing the president's reported weight.\n\nIf \"that's what 6-3, 239 pounds looks like, that's a shock to me.\" Scarborough said, according to the Hill.\n\nScarborough's co-host, Mika Brzezinski, addressed the results of Trump's MOCA test, saying, \"I'm not sure if it makes me feel better that this doctor says he has no cognitive issues. It makes me feel worse and more worried for the country.\"\n\n\"We won't question the doctor,\" Scarborough said. \"I will say on his mental sharpness, if that is in fact the case, and medically, perhaps, that is, he has shocked and surprised a lot of people.\"\n\nClick here to read a summary of Trump's physical exam and here to watch Jackson read a summary of the report and answer reporters' questions.\n\nDr. Bandy Lee, an assistant professor in forensic psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine and co-author of the controversial book, The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump \u2014 which includes a commentary by Noam Chomsky warning that Trump is a threat to \"human species' survival\" \u2014 told Newsweek Wednesday that the MOCA test Johnson performed on the president last week still doesn't address her concerns about his psychiatric wellbeing.\n\n\"The MOCA was not the test she believed he needed,\" Newsweek reported.\n\n\"Screening someone with a test you'd give to people who seem normal isn't an effective approach for a person who has already shown signs that require in-depth evaluation,\" Lee argued, according to Newsweek.\n\nIn August 2016, after Trump had won the Republican nomination for president, left-leaning media started reporting on claims of Trump's fitness to serve, which led American Psychiatric Association President Maria Oquendo to issue a statement advising members to abide by a principle commonly known as \"the Goldwater Rule,\" which says psychiatrists shouldn't offer opinions on someone they have not personally evaluated.\n\nBut that hasn't stopped Lee and her group, the National Coalition of Concerned Mental Health Experts, all of whom are opposed to Trump, from promoting their claims and urging citizens to call their representatives in Congress and warn of \"Donald Trump's dangerousness and the need for immediate evaluation under the provisions of the 25th Amendment.\"\n\nIn an interview with The Christian Post via email Friday, Lee reiterated her accusations that the president is \"dangerous.\"\n\n\"He has exhibited multiple dangerous behaviors,\" Lee said, asserting that one \"indication of [Trump's] fragility is how he panders to his 'base,' no matter how extreme and how shrinking, he needs those extraordinary levels of adulation to survive.\"\n\nShe also cited Trump's use of Twitter as problematic, saying, \"the sheer frequency of his tweets seemed to reflect [his] frantic state of mind.\"\n\nLee then suggested that Trump is to blame for any increases in gun violence, bullying at schools and hate crimes. And warned that he could \"instigate civil conflict, and lay a foundation for a violent culture that could give way to epidemics of violence.\"\n\nLee further argued that Trump \"declaring Jerusalem as Israel's capital\" was like \"poking a beehive in the Middle East.\"\n\n\"He resorts to violence the more he feels threatened,\" she said, \"and it is a typical pattern. It is a pattern that also echoes through his decision to pull out of the Paris accord, contributing to collective suicidal behavior, and his tax bill that will assuredly increase inequality, which is the most potent stimulant for mass violence \u2014 which we might see in terms of suicide epidemics, homicide epidemics or wars.\"\n\nIn response to her claims that Trump is exhibiting neurological problems, she said she believes he's \"exhibiting signs that appear very neurological, but it is not possible to diagnose from afar, and only a full examination will reveal whether it is neurological, psychological, or medical in origin.\"\n\nAt the press briefing Tuesday, NBC News Chief White House Correspondent Hallie Jackson was the first to ask about Trump's mental fitness for office. This was followed by a reporter who asked about Trump \"appearing to slur his words\" at a recent press conference.\n\nJackson said the reason for that was because the president had been taking Sudafed for several days prior and he simply had a dry mouth.\n\nWhen ABC News' Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl asked Jackson how it was possible for a man who eats fast food, drinks diet cokes and doesn't exercise (other than playing golf) to be \"in as good of shape as you say he's in,\" the doctor explained that Trump hasn't been eating fast food since he's been president because he eats the food the White House chefs prepare for him. Jackson added that Trump \"just has incredibly good genes and it's just the way God made him.\"\n\nCNN's Jim Acosta later followed up by asking Jackson if there is anything he's \"keeping from the press for privacy reasons.\" Jackson further explained that he's been involved in the last six or seven physical exams [for Obama and now Trump] and \"this is hands down more information that's been put forth by any other assessment [of presidents] to date.\"\n\nRichard Benedetto, an adjunct professor of journalism and retired White House correspondent and columnist for USA Today who covered four presidential administrations, told CP that the media's reporting on Trump's mental health \"is all part and parcel of the one goal that the media who cover politics and the presidency seem to have these days, and that's let's get him out of office \u2014 that's the goal that they have. And so whatever we can come up with that would hasten that goal is fair game.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Benedetto said, \"Trump gives them things to play off of because he's brash, he speaks off the cuff, he reacts quickly to when somebody criticizes him. Therefore, he makes it relatively easy for them to then say, 'Ah ha, he's doing this; ah ha, it shows that.' And then they go and ask some psychologist or psychiatrist, 'Well, what does that mean?'\n\n\"And what you end up with is this narrative that somehow or other this guy is deranged and mentally unbalanced. And it plays perfectly to those who can't stand him, and it angers those who support him.\n\n\"It's one more piece of evidence that the media detractors point to, to say, 'You see, all they want to do is get this guy out, and they don't cover the news fairly, and they don't cover the news honestly, and they don't give us the full story,\" Benedetto added. \"You've got this continuous clash between those who support Trump and those who don't.\"", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/trump-mentally-fit-office-health-results-media-mental-critics-214134/"}

I mean, everything is so much easier than it used to be. However, in a lot of aspects, things are much harder than they ever have been.\n\nModern day society has taken a violent turn in the direction of consumerism. Because of the internet, social media platforms have taken over our lives. So much so that it\u2019s like we are living parallel lives online. We\u2019re obsessed with likes, comments, and shares. We try and maintain a clean feed and timeline that depict the way we want people to view us as. These are alter egos that are nothing like your true self. This has caused almost everyone to lose their sense of self, purpose, and dreams. All anyone cares about now is how people think of them and how high up in status they can get by achieving wealth, objects, homes, and clothes.\n\nConsumerism has had not only an awful effect on society as a whole, but it\u2019s killing the Earth too. The excessive demand for money, goods, and pointless objects has caused factories, plants, landfills, and more to pop up all around us. This has caused massive amounts of pollution, exposure, and deforestation of our planet\u2019s natural resources. Even worse, what natural resources are left have been poisoned by chemicals and byproducts of mass production.\n\nConsumerism will be the way we self-destruct ourselves. It\u2019s going to put an end to humanity, very likely resulting in the last extinction Earth will see. Hell, our massive demand for anything we can spend money on might very well cause the end of days for Earth as a planet entirely! Why not try taking a step back from the world of consumerism? After all, the best things in life aren\u2019t really things at all.\n\nPhoto by The Odyssey", "domain": "awarenessact.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://awarenessact.com/the-dark-side-of-consumerism-how-our-endless-need-for-things-is-going-to-end-humanity-forever/"}

We detected gravitational waves for the third time ever and have made so much progress.\n\nWork in regards to this was published in Physical Review Letters and to be honest, it is still blowing my mind even now. These waves were detected by the twin Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors. No one thought in the past that there would ever even be a way to actually observe these waves and now here we are doing just that.\n\nOne observation that really sticks out was one that occurred between black holes that were larger than the Sun itself. The collision of two black holes produces so much more power than all the light radiated from the galaxies and stars at any one time. Yes, it is that extreme.\n\nMIT\u2019s David Shoemaker, Spokesperson for the LIGO Scientific Collaboration said as follows in a statement:\n\n\u201cWe have further confirmation of the existence of stellar-mass black holes that are larger than 20 solar masses \u2013 these are objects we didn\u2019t know existed before LIGO detected them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is remarkable that humans can put together a story, and test it, for such strange and extreme events that took place billions of years ago and billions of light-years distant from us. The entire LIGO and Virgo scientific collaborations worked to put all these pieces together.\u201d\n\nIsn\u2019t that interesting? This is truly a remarkable feat in itself. LIGO is working towards uncovering so much.\n\n\u201cIt looks like Einstein was right\u2014even for this new event, which is about two times farther away than our first detection,\u201d says Laura Cadonati of Georgia Tech and the Deputy Spokesperson of the LSC. \u201cWe can see no deviation from the predictions of general relativity, and this greater distance helps us to make that statement with more confidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe LIGO instruments have reached impressive sensitivities,\u201d notes Jo van den Brand, the Virgo Collaboration spokesperson, a physicist at the Dutch National Institute for Subatomic Physics (Nikhef) and professor at VU University in Amsterdam. \u201cWe expect that by this summer Virgo, the European interferometer, will expand the network of detectors, helping us to better localize the signals.\u201d\n\nThe LIGO-Virgo team is continuing to search the latest LIGO data for signs of space-time ripples from the far reaches of the cosmos. They are also working on technical upgrades for LIGO\u2019s next run, scheduled to begin in late 2018, during which the detectors\u2019 sensitivity will be improved.\n\n\u201cWith the third confirmed detection of gravitational waves from the collision of two black holes, LIGO is establishing itself as a powerful observatory for revealing the dark side of the universe,\u201d says David Reitze of Caltech, executive director of the LIGO Laboratory. \u201cWhile LIGO is uniquely suited to observing these types of events, we hope to see other types of astrophysical events soon, such as the violent collision of two neutron stars.\u201d\n\nThere is so much to learn and it seems as time passes so much will be uncovered.

Breakups are far more complicated than we want them to be and that is saying the least.\n\nWhen we have put our heart into someone we never completely get it back. I have noticed throughout my years of love and heartbreak as well as seeing the romances and destructions of other relationships through my friends that there are quite a few stages of sadness or grieving we go through when a serious breakup occurs. These stages are as follows.\n\nUnexpected Breakups: The 7 Stages of \u2018Getting Over It\u2019:\n\n1. Disconnection\n\nYou feel like your whole world has fallen apart and this could not be real. It\u2019s like you think you will wake up the next morning to find the breakup was nothing more than a silly dream. This stage passes quickly.\n\n2. Sadness/Heartache\n\nYou become sad, however, the longer time passes the less sad you get. Sure, it still hurts but your heartache is transforming into something else. This stage can last for quite some time.\n\nYou are pissed that this person you cared so deeply for would call things off or that they would do what they did to you. You feel betrayed and demolished. You want to destroy them.\n\n4. Pleading/Trying to Force Things\n\nNow, at this point, you are past your anger and want your love back. You are trying to work things out and force the relationship back into place. This rarely works.\n\nOnce you realize pushing things together isn\u2019t working, it only makes you hurt more. Your heart will feel as if it has been shattered three hundred times over. This is one of the worst feelings you could possibly experience.\n\n6. Acceptance\n\nEventually, you accept that the relationship is over and you begin to show your true self again. You work towards getting back to who you were and learning how to live without this person. Everything begins to run smoothly but you aren\u2019t quite ready to date anyone else.\n\nOnce you find yourself you will eventually decide it is time to move on. This point can come months, years, or merely weeks later. That is all up to you. Your life is yours to make with it what you wish. Don\u2019t let heartache break you.\n\nHave you ever experienced these things? I for one have a few times and never want to again. It is a bit comforting thought, knowing, in the end, we can all accept things and move forward.\n\n(Image Via: Pixabay/darksouls1 )", "domain": "awarenessact.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://awarenessact.com/unexpected-breakups-the-7-stages-of-getting-over-it/"}

Some people have one or the other of these symptoms and others have both. Sure most of us experience these things in life at one point or another but those with this disorder experience them sometimes their whole lives, they just never go away.\n\nThis disorder seems to be more common in those who have had extremely traumatic experiences in life. Now, the main treatment for something like this is merely talking with a psychologist through a series of sessions depending on the severity. This disorder can take complete control over someone\u2019s life. Those with this disorder often experience issues functioning at work or at school. While during these episodes they are aware their sense of detachment is a feeling and not truly real, it still takes a very serious toll on them.\n\nFeeling as if you are an observer of your thoughts and so forth within yourself and not truly yourself.\n\nFeeling as if your body is distorted in some way.\n\nFeeling as if your memories lack emotion or might not be your own.\n\nFeeling as if you are not in control of the things you say or do.\n\nDerealization Symptoms:\n\nFeeling disconnected emotionally from the people close to you.\n\nFeeling as if you are not familiar with the things surrounding you. Almost experiencing things as if you were in a movie.\n\nYour perception of time is distorted.\n\nYour sense of distance is distorted.\n\nThis is a disorder that only affects about 2 percent of the population. It can also come with other mental disorders and physical disorders. Most people with this disorder feel as if they are unable to feel anything. They feel like they are a robot almost. Everything is just foggy and unreal to them. You can learn more about the different treatment options for this disorder by clicking here.\n\nIt seems people with this disorder tend to begin showing signs in their early childhood years and it rarely shows up in people over the age of 40. Studies have also shown that poor sleep quality has been associated with more severe symptoms of dissociation. This is a mental illness that has not been researched anywhere near enough.\n\n\ufeff\n\nImage via Odyssey", "domain": "awarenessact.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://awarenessact.com/the-real-unreal-reality-of-depersonalization-derealization-disorder/"}

While they may seem nice, many people are good at \u2018faking it.\u2019\n\nHave you ever gotten close to someone and told them all of your secrets just to have them exploit you later? I know I have and it brings about a feeling I would not want to have to experience again. Betrayal is not something any of us deal well with.\n\nIf you want to learn how to spot a fake friend the list below should help big time. These are things we should all be on the lookout for. Friendship is something we all consider to be important whether we want to admit it or not. Don\u2019t let other people take advantage of your kindness or trusting nature.\n\n10 Things You Need to Be Aware of When Trying to Spot Fake Friends:\n\n1. Fake friends don\u2019t make time for you.\n\nThey will not go out of their way to check on you or see if you need someone to spend a little time with. Unless it is on their terms they do not want to hang out. Sometimes they even actually go to great lengths to avoid you.\n\n2. Fake friends will speak negatively about you/to you.\n\nThey will make fun of you to your face and in front of others as well. They want to bring you down. This is their way of \u2018getting under your skin\u2019 yet they pretend it is all a \u2018joke.\u2019\n\n3. Fake friends will not message you unless they need something.\n\nThey will only want to talk to you when they want something from you. You might go weeks on end without hearing a peep but as soon as they are broke or bored they come calling. If you text them they ignore it but if you don\u2019t reply to their texts they get pissy.\n\nThey are always turning nothing into something. Pettiness is their game of choice and boy are they good at it. You are constantly trying to win back their affection even though their affection is complete bullshit.\n\n5. Fake friends will let you do stupid shit.\n\nThey don\u2019t take your keys when you\u2019re drunk and they don\u2019t care if you hook up with your ex. They won\u2019t give you their opinion when you ask for it because they want to see you do stupid shit. They want to have something to hold over you or something to laugh at you about.\n\n6. Fake friends criticize you far too much for the things you choose to do in life.\n\nThey are constantly critiquing the things you do in life. Nothing is ever good enough. Everything you do just seems to never be good enough unless it is making you look bad to the rest of the world.\n\n7. Fake friends will gossip A LOT.\n\nThey will be the ones who always have all the gossip on everyone. They love talking shit to you about everyone you both know and chances are they do the same about you to their other friends. No one is safe from the gossip queen or king.\n\n8. Fake friends want you to make them a priority.\n\nThey will do their best to ensure that you make them a priority. They want you to see them as more than they are. They will pretend to literally be your best friend even though they don\u2019t care about you at all.\n\nThey want you to be there on the sidelines. They want the spotlight all to themselves. If you begin to overshadow them they will cut you down in the worst ways.\n\n10. Fake friends will pretty much compete with you.\n\nThey will do their best to make themselves look better than you. If you get a nice new jacket they get a nicer new jacket. If you get a better job they will get a better job than that. They only want to be better than you. You aren\u2019t really the friends you wish you were.\n\nFeatured image via Odyssey", "domain": "awarenessact.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://awarenessact.com/10-fool-proof-ways-to-spot-a-fake-friend/"}

Just 69 hours into the shutdown \u2013 most of the time passed over the weekend when few Americans even noticed the government was closed \u2013 Democrats and other open-borders lawmakers staged a tactical retreat, handing President Trump and anti-amnesty conservatives a clear victory. Democrats no doubt were aware of a Harvard-Harris poll that found 58 percent of voters opposed to the Democrat-led shutdown.\n\nDemocrats got essentially nothing in exchange for voting to re-open the government, which made the Republican triumph even sweeter. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) made an unenforceable promise to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to bring an immigration bill to the floor \u2013 he said merely that it was his intention to do so \u2013 if a compromise cannot be made regarding the illegals before government funding runs out again. \u201cI doubted it was possible, but Dems have actually lost a shutdown fight,\u201d tweeted Fox News commentator Brit Hume. \u201cSchumer has agreed to end the filibuster in exchange for practically nothing. Make no mistake: Schumer & Dems caved. What a political fiasco.\u201d Republicans are almost never deemed \u201cwinners\u201d of shutdown-based confrontations, but major left-wing activist groups almost universally acknowledged this time the GOP outmaneuvered Schumer who still managed to brag he was \u201cconfident\u201d he could get 60 votes in the Senate for an amnesty bill. Charles Chamberlain, executive director of the left-wing group Democracy for America, mocked Democrats for backing down from a fight. \u201cToday\u2019s cave by some Senate Democrats was not only a stunning display of moral and political cowardice, it was a strategically incoherent move that demonstrates precisely why so many believe the Democratic Party doesn\u2019t stand for anything,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to know why we lost in 2016 and why a Democratic wave in 2018 is far from guaranteed, despite the deep level of disgust for Donald Trump, look no further than this weak and profoundly disappointing cave from Senate Democrats.\u201d\n\nIt was Democrats\u2019 single-minded obsession with securing amnesty for around 700,000 individuals who sought relief under the constitutionally suspect Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that led to the shutdown of the federal government at 12:01 a.m. Saturday for the first time in the Trump era. Trump said in September he planned to end DACA and gave Congress six months to find a legislative fix. \u201cI am pleased that Democrats in Congress have come to their senses and are now willing to fund our great military, border patrol, first responders, and insurance for vulnerable children,\u201d President Trump said Monday afternoon in a press release. \u201cAs I have always said, once the Government is funded, my Administration will work toward solving the problem of very unfair illegal immigration. We will make a long-term deal on immigration if, and only if, it is good for our country.\u201d At 6:10 last night, the House of Representatives voted 266 to 150 to give final congressional approval to H.R. 195, which provides stopgap funding for the federal Leviathan through Feb. 8, and clears the way for furloughed federal employees to return to work today. On the Democrat side, 144 voted against the bill, while only 45 voted in favor of it. President Trump signed the bill into law hours later. Before H.R. 195, there had already been three stopgap spending bills this federal fiscal year that began Oct. 1. In the afternoon, the Senate voted 81 to 18 to approve the temporary spending measure that previously contained language funding the government through Feb. 16. Before that, at lunchtime the Senate voted by an identical margin to end the Democrats\u2019 filibuster and clear the way for the spending vote.\n\nContinued below... Democrats have been furiously emoting and virtue-signaling that granting amnesty to youthful illegal aliens as a noble endeavor The stopgap legislation also funds the Clinton-era Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which used to be called the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP). The welfare program provides matching funds to states for health insurance to families with children, but in practice the feds fund almost all of the program\u2019s budget. Backed by the late Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), CHIP came as a kind of bipartisan consolation prize for left-wingers in the wake of the Clintons\u2019 failed health care takeover. CHIP covered about 8.9 million children in 2016, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The boondoggle, which cost $15.6 billion in 2016, applies to families earning too much for Medicaid eligibility but not enough for private health insurance. Funding for the program lapsed in the fall. H.R. 195 appears to allocate $124.2 billion for the program over a six-year period ending Sept. 30, 2023. Many Democrats have been furiously emoting and virtue-signaling in order to depict the prospective granting of amnesty to youthful illegal aliens as a noble endeavor, instead of what it really is, namely, an obvious attempt to create new Democrat voters. Dick Durbin: \u201cThe civil rights issue of our time.\u201d In a Senate floor speech that probably won\u2019t play in Peoria, Illinois Democrat Dick Durbin absurdly declared that granting legal status to DACA-eligible illegal aliens is \u201cthe civil rights issue of our time.\u201d \u201cSo many of you cast a vote that was very hard and very difficult, because you believed as I did that the issue of immigration, the issue of the DREAMers is the civil rights issue of our time,\u201d said the Senate minority whip. \u201cYou stuck your necks out and said I\u2019m willing to go on record even if it\u2019s going to be hard to explain back home, and I will never forget that.\u201d There are around 700,000 DACA-eligible individuals who supposedly came as young people to the U.S. but they may be a subset of around 4 million or so so-called DREAMers, many of whom failed to apply for relief under DACA but could conceivably qualify under the kind of amnesty Democrats want. Contrary to what the word implies, DREAMers tend to be less educated and less established than typical Americans.", "domain": "canadafreepress.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://canadafreepress.com/print_friendly/democrats-lose-big-time-as-shutdown-ends"}

You might think choosing diet is a healthy decision, but you probably aren\u2019t aware of the dangerous effects of aspartame.\n\nMany people don\u2019t question the ingredients that are really in their foods, especially today. People automatically assume that diet drinks are healthy for you just because they have less sugar and calories. Most people are not aware that companies like Coca-Cola and Pepsico. replace sugar and calories with ingredients that are not the same, but taste similar. Although their products might be rather tasty, they\u2019re horrible for your body.\n\nOne of the main ingredients that are in diet soda is aspartame. Aspartame is an artificial sweetener to replace the sugar from a regular soda. While it tastes very similar, it is nothing like sugar. Aspartame is a laboratory-engineered chemical that is terrible for your body. It\u2019s not just \u2018bad\u2019 for you either; it\u2019s literally poison. It can triple your risk of stroke and Dementia a new study finds.\n\nThe study was performed by scientists from Boston University. They studied over 4,400 different adults to really find out the effects of chemicals in diet drinks. They concluded that adults who have one diet drink per day are three times more at risk of suffering from stroke and dementia. The researchers conducted this study for almost ten years. The daily mail reports that the team concluded adults who had more or more diet drinks a day were 2.9 times more likely to develop dementia and 3 times more at risk for strokes or other cardiovascular issues.\n\nMatthew Pase, a senior fellow in the department of neurology at Boston University School of Medicine, states:\n\n\u201cOur study shows a need to put more research into this area given how often people drink artificially sweetened beverages. Although we did not find an association between stroke or dementia and the consumption of sugary drinks, this certainly does not mean they are a healthy option.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe recommend that people drink water on a regular basis instead of sugary or artificially sweetened beverages,\u201d Pase added.\n\nThe team urges healthcare professionals to stop promoting diet drinks as a suitable replacement for regular soda. This isn\u2019t the only study that has been performed on diet drinks and their effects either. Other findings were revealed by research performed by the Imperial College in London. It was published in the American Heart Association\u2019s Journal Stroke, and it followed 4.372 adults over the age of 45. Each participant filled out a questionnaire about the daily food and drink intake.\n\nIn regards to the latest research, Dr. Rosa Sancho, Head of Research at Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK, said:\n\n\u201cAs people are becoming more aware of the consequences of a high-sugar diet, many are turning to artificially-sweetened diet fizzy drinks as an alternative to those with lots of sugar. Future studies will need to confirm these findings in other groups of people, and explore what might be underlying any link between artificially-sweetened soft drinks and dementia.\u201d\n\nGavin Partington, director-general of the British Soft Drinks Association, disagrees with the empirical data. He commented on the finding,\n\n\u201cDespite their claims, the authors of this observational study admit they found no cause and effect and provide no science-based evidence whatsoever to support their theories. In fact, based on the evidence, Public Health England is actively encouraging food and drink companies to use low-calorie sweeteners as an alternative to sugar and help people manage their weight.\u201d\n\nI would recommend anyone that drinks diet drinks to immediately make a different decision on beverages. If you\u2019re already choosing diet beverages, you must be health conscious! But little did you even know, diet drinks are the direct opposite of a healthy decision. If you decide to cut out sodas, you will experience a relief in headaches and migraines. If you are a sufferer of frequent headaches or migraines, it might be caused by your diet soda habit! A 2013 animal study found that rats that drank diet soda had damaged cells and nerve endings in the cerebellum\u2014the part of the brain responsible for motor skills! You\u2019ll also have more sensitive taste buds, weight loss, strengthened bones, and you even handle booze better! Amazing!\n\nThe next time you\u2019re tempted by a diet soda, remember all the deadly effects the sweeteners have on your body. If the stuff can clear a clogged drainage pipe, it probably isn\u2019t good for your digestive system.\n\nImage Via Flickr", "domain": "awarenessact.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://awarenessact.com/scientific-studies-prove-that-aspartame-is-by-far-one-of-the-deadliest-food-additives-around-today/"}

However, even with this movement obviously taking place, many people continue to grapple with the age-old question: \u201cBut what about the children?\u201d\n\nWhile numerous studies have been conducted to find the link between spirituality and happiness in adults, little research has been done regarding children. Even adolescents have been found to have increased happiness when leading a more spiritual life. In an attempt to widen their views regarding happiness and spirituality, researchers from the University of British Columbia in Canada set out to find how children and spirituality link up.\n\nTheir findings were published by Dr. Mark Holder and his colleagues, Dr. Ben Coleman and Judi Wallace in the Journal of Happiness Studies. According to their findings, the personal aspects of spirituality and communal aspects were both very strong indicators of whether or not a child would be happy. In contrast, their research also endeavored to find how religion affected children. In this particular portion of the study, they found that religions practices had very little effect on whether or not a child would be happy.\n\nLive Science reports that other research has been conducted regarding children and religion. During those studies, the children who were religious were found to be well-adjusted and well-behaved, however, as they point out, that isn\u2019t the same as happiness.\n\nAnother study that was published in the Journal of Religion and Health from Columbia University found that happiness and the character traits of grit and persistence go \u201chand in hand\u201d with spirituality.\n\nFurthermore, according to Time, the study found that \u201cchildren are born with an innate capacity for spirituality, just as they are born with the capability to learn a language, read and think. But just as it takes time and effort to develop the ability to speak or read, it also takes time and effort to develop our innate sense of the spiritual.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about their thoughts on the results of the study conducted by the University of British Columbia, the researchers explained that, \u201cEnhancing personal meaning may be a key factor in the relation between spirituality and happiness,\u201d continuing, Holder even suggested to Live Science that acts of kindness towards others, altruism, and volunteering were also great ways to give children the meaning they so yearned for.\n\nWhile studies are never entirely conclusive, what harm could come from raising children who are more spiritually in tune with other human beings and that cared for their fellow beings as much as they care for themselves? Honestly, for me, I could envision no other way to raise my child.

By comparison, only 30 percent of millenials, 30 percent of Generation X and 26 percent of Baby Boomers said the same.\n\nThe study shows that almost twice as many teens in Generation Z (13 percent) claimed to be atheist than millenials (7 percent).\n\n\"Gen Z is different because they have grown up in a post-Christian, post-modern environment where many of them have not even been exposed to Christianity or to church. So that is a really unique shift,\" Brooke Hempell, Barna's senior vice president of research, said during the survey's rollout event at Grace Midtown Church in Atlanta.\n\n\"There are a lot of churches that are empty in this country. Gen Z is the one who is really showing the fruit of that. There are many of them [who] are a spiritual blank slate. For the first time in our nation's history, that is more and more common.\"\n\nFor the project, Barna conducted a total of four focus groups with U.S. teenagers between the ages of 14 and 17 and also conducted two nationally representative surveys that included responses from a total of 1,997 teens throughout the United States.\n\nThe first survey, conducted between Nov. 4- 16, 2016, interviewed 1,490 teens ages 13 to 18. The second survey was conducted on July 7-18, 2017, and interviewed 507 teens between the ages of 13 to 18. The data from both surveys were minimally weighted to U.S. Census data in order to be representative of ethnicity, gender, age and region.\n\nThe research also found that just 59 percent Generation Z teens considered themselves Christian or Catholic. By comparison, 65 percent of millennials and Generation X and 75 percent of Baby Boomers identified as some form of Christian.\n\nAlthough nearly six in 10 Generation Z teens identified as Christians, Barna's research shows that only four percent of Generation Z held a \"biblical worldview.\"\n\nUsing \"a classification of faith based on widely accepted, orthodox Christian beliefs,\" Barna developed a set of theological criteria that each respondent had to meet in order to be classified as having a biblical worldview.\n\n\"The percentage of people whose beliefs qualify them for a biblical worldview declines in each successively younger generation: 10 percent of Boomers, 7 percent of Gen X and 6 percent of Millennials have a biblical worldview, compared to only 4 percent of Gen Z,\" the study explains.\n\nThe study also found that just four out of 10 Generation Z teens agreed that the Bible is \"totally accurate in all of the principles it teaches.\" Meanwhile, just 61 percent of \"churched teens\" agreed that the Bible is totally accurate in all the principles it teaches.\n\nJust 85 percent of churchgoing Generation Z teens believed that Jesus Christ was \"a real person who was crucified by Rome and was actually physically raised from the dead.\"\n\n\"Where is that latent unbelief happening? We see a lot of it in science,\" Hempell explained. \"Teens are beginning to feel like they have to choose between science and the Bible, where as the Baby Boomer generation or Gen X said that they can see the Bible and science as being complementary ... When we get to millenials and Gen Z, they see them in conflict.\"\n\nAccording to the data, 28 percent of Generation Z teens believed that \"science and the Bible are complementary.\" By comparison, nearly half of Boomers (45 percent) and more than one-third of Generation X respondents (36 percent) said the same.\n\n\"For [many], they are going to fall on the side of science,\" Hempell continued. \"A quarter of Gen Z would say, 'I don't see the Bible and science getting along so I am just going to go with what science says because to me that is the truth.'\"\n\nOther findings show that 12 percent of Generation Z identified sexually as something other than \"hetrosexual,\" with seven percent saying they are \"bisexual.\"\n\n\"This is the highest percentage of self-identified non-hetrosexual experience that we are seeing now of any generation,\" Barna President David Kinnaman said during his remarks during the rollout event. \"This is much larger than millenials.\"\n\nAdditionally, seven out of 10 Generation Z teens said that they think it is acceptable to be born one gender and \"feel like another.\" Three out of 10 teens reported knowing someone who had changed their gender identity.\n\n\"[Y]oung Christians are struggling as much as we have seen it in the 20-plus years I have been at Barna and in the 35-plus years of our company to understand how to live out their faith in an increasingly skeptical culture,\" Kinnaman said. \"They are having to represent what the Bible says, what it means to be Christian, in a culture that doesn't understand it or who believes that the Bible is simply a book that is religious dogma that has been used to oppress people, that being Christian is extremist or irrelevant in our society.\"\n\n\"I think about what we might do to use discernment and I am asking you how it is in your church and your context, in your ministry could help kids [today] have a more robust experience of what it means to be Christian,\" he added. \"We need to be thinking theologically. We need to challenge them.

Religious groups don't get second-class treatment.\"\n\nBLinC filed a lawsuit against the school in December after they were kicked off campus because the school deemed that the organization violated its policy on discrimination by asking student leaders to sign a statement of faith that requires them to adhere to lifestyle and moral standards that exclude engaging in \"sexual immorality\" and other behavior deemed sinful.\n\nThe group requested expedited relief so that they could be allowed back on campus to participate in the University of Iowa's spring recruitment fairs being held Wednesday, one of the biggest opportunities of the semester for student clubs to recruit new members. A hearing was held last Thursday.\n\nRose wrote in her decision that the school doesn't seem to fairly apply its human rights policy.\n\nAlthough BLinC was punished for having a religious restriction in its leadership policy that went against the school's policy on discrimination, the Muslim campus group Imam Mahdi is seemingly allowed to have a policy in which membership benefits are reserved for Shia Muslims and leaders must \"refrain from major sins (kaba'ir) and endeavor to avoid minor sins (saga'ir).\"\n\n\"[T]he court must conclude on the current record that BLinC has shown that the university does not consistently and equally apply its Human Rights Policy,\" the judge wrote in her decision. \"This raises an issue regarding whether BLinC's viewpoint was the reason it was not allowed to operate with membership requirements that the university had determined violated the policy, while at the same time Imam Mahdi was not subjected to any enforcement action.\"\n\n\"In light of this selective enforcement, the Court finds BLinC has established the requisite fair chance of prevailing on the merits of its claims under the Free Speech Clause,\" the judge's decision continued.\n\nAfter a student complained last year to school administration about the BLinC policy requiring leaders to adhere to a statement of faith that opposes homosexuality, among other sins, school administrators demanded that the group revise its policy. According to Becket, the school required BLinC to submit an \"acceptable plan\" for selecting leaders if it wanted to be reinstated.\n\n\"The university would never let Iowa State's Cy the Cardinal lead the Hawkeyes,\" BLinC Student President Jacob Estell said in a statement Tuesday. \"So why would it think it is OK to force religious student groups to select leaders who don't embrace their mission?\"\n\nThe University of Iowa released the following statement after the court's ruling:\n\n\"The court has ordered the university to restore BLinC to registered student organization status for 90 days,\" the school's statement reads, according to The Gazette. \"The university respects the decision of the court and has acted accordingly by extending an invitation to BLinC to participate in the student organization fair on Jan. 24.

Ward's objection was to the assertion that Muslims worship the same God as Christians and Jews and argued that such a claim is \"utterly incorrect and false on many levels.\"\n\nExpand | Collapse (Photo: Facebook.com / Jeanette Ward, U-46 School Board Member)\n\nAccording to Ward's Facebook post from Dec. 14, the assignment states that \"Muslims, Christians and Jews all worship the same complex God. But each religion believes that its books and teachings reveal the true nature of that God. This disagreement has shaped the course of human history.\"\n\nAfter reading the article, students were asked to answer comprehension questions.\n\n\"By bringing this matter to light, Ms. Ward has done great service for all the sixth-graders and their parents in School District U46,\" Elgin resident L. Dean Hufsey was quoted as saying during the meeting.\n\nArt Ellingsen, a pastor Arlington Heights, was also present at the meeting a refuted the claim.\n\n\"To say that Allah of the Quran and the God of the Bible are the same is simply absurd,\" Ellingsen was quoted as saying.\n\nAccording to the Elgin Courier-News, another concerned resident argued that such an assignment shows that the school system is \"playing with children's eternal lives.\"\n\n\"It's not just something flying in the wind, it's not just a political issue, it is a faith issue, and faith issues are very important to a lot of people in this community,\" Pastor Mark Frusti was quoted as saying during the meeting.\n\nWard has received much criticism for her social media posts about the homework assignments and Islam. In a school board meeting that took place in December, four faith leaders from different congregations spoke out against Ward's social media posts.\n\n\"We feel that, more important than the content of the article is the question of how we are to engage with inevitable differences of opinion, theology and worldview,\" Katie Shaw Thompson, pastor of the Highland Avenue Church of the Brethren in Elgin, said during the December meeting, according to the Elgin Courier-News. \"Here, we strongly take exception to Ms. Ward's approach on her social media post.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Ward responded to criticisms that she has made the homework assignment issue too \"political.\"\n\n\"What is 'political' and HYPOCRITICAL is indoctrinating students with assignments like the one discussed last night, with a decidedly POLITICAL, non-scholarly, inaccurate, agnostic, and progressive ideology, expecting that those with an opposing view would have nothing to say about it,\" Ward wrote on her Facebook page.\n\n\"This is not an isolated incident. The idea that Muslims, Christians and Jews worship the same God is taught repeatedly in U-46 curriculum resources and textbooks, which I have pointed out on many occasions.

There are no Bible verses, references to any spiritual deity, or any activities that expose students to any religious concepts.\"\n\nGardin even stressed that he watched several video clips that are shown to students to reinforce the concepts they learn from the program. According to Gardin, \"all of them were free from any religious content.\"\n\n\"I spoke with the facilitator of the program, Matt Willingham. Mr. Willingham confirmed that no verses from any type of religious text are used,\" Gardin assured. \"He added that he would be happy to meet with any parent or group of parents who would like to know more about Elevate Students.\"\n\nGardin added that at the end of the Elevate Students program, students are asked to share what they learned from the program.\n\n\"The students' comments have been transcribed for improved legibility and are enclosed,\" the letter reads. \"You will find that none of the students described any type of spiritual awakening or realization. What they learned were life principles that are religion neutral that will assist them in developing into adults who can lead their families and communities in productive ways.\"\n\nGardin told CP in an email that he received a complaint from a parent earlier this school year about the Elevate Students program. However, when Gardin informed the parent that the program was not religious but merely a secular character building program, he never heard back from the parent.\n\nGardin asked FFRF to issue a retraction of its Jan. 16 news release in which the organization claims that the school district is allowing preachers to proselytize to students.\n\n\"Since it has been demonstrated the school corporation is not allowing preachers to proselytize at one of our schools, I request you remove the erroneous information from your website regarding this topic and replace it with a retraction apologizing for the error,\" the letter reads.\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, no retraction was issued by FFRF.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/atheist-groups-demand-pastor-led-student-program-banned-rejected-school-district-215012/"}

Public commenters can then only speak on school board agenda items which the board can carefully and narrowly dictate and eliminate any opportunities for walk-in speakers to address the topic they want. It would also reportedly ban substituting speakers and sharing speaker time.\n\n\"It's a con game,\" one parent said to CP.\n\nControversy erupted in the county in 2015 when the FCSB voted to replace biological sex with \"gender identity\" in official school guidelines. Only one FCSB member dissented.\n\nThe new policy holds that boys who self-identify as female can use the girls' shower facilities, locker rooms, and bathrooms, and it was voted in without any time for public debate and adopted within weeks. This abrupt move stood in stark contrast to previous school policy considerations in which the FCSB reportedly spent 10 years debating and experimenting with school start times, conducting multiple surveys and asking for community input over the course of many months.\n\nWhat occurs in Fairfax County has implications for many American public school students as the county often serves as a model district after which other locales pattern their educational best practices.\n\nSources say that the gender identity issue has led to increased attention from local residents and concerned parents who were either unaware of or had no time to weigh in when the measure was passed over two years ago. Many have come to school board meetings to voice their objections ever since, even if the issue is not explicitly on the agenda for the night.\n\nAround 100 parents have complained about the board's \"betrayal of public trust\" and rapid embrace of gender ideology and their concerns with the sex education curriculum at these meetings. The parents often begin by first speaking to an issue that is on the agenda and then creatively pivoting to their concerns in order to voice them. This is reportedly a source of great embarrassment to the school board which does not want to revisit the matter.\n\nThe school board has repeatedly said that nothing will substantively change and thus far no regulations pertaining to gender identity have been issued; draft regulations were tabled in July of 2016 even as the 2015 policy remains in effect.\n\nAs The Daily Signal reported in March 2017, in Fairfax a mere 10 parents have three minutes each during public comment time to present their views to the county school board each meeting and \"[e]arning one of these coveted slots is like buying concert tickets: You get up early on the Monday before the meeting and click frantically, hoping to be among the first 10 when the school board opens its sign-up line.\"\n\nIf no concerned parent manages to acquire one of the 10 coveted speaking slots on a night where policy changes about gender identity might be considered and everyone who does get to speak voices support, the illusion will be created that open public debate has occurred and that the general population is broadly behind this when the reverse is true. By tightly controlling the agenda to circumvent controversial topics once their agenda has gained sufficient ground, the public process changes can then be used to squash any opposing voices.\n\nThe proposed procedural moves would tighten what can be discussed and \"the school board can block any speakers in the future who might want to try to retroactively address items in the past because they were never given the chance due to sign up to speak [restriction], due to manipulation,\" which amounts to censorship, parents said to CP.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/parents-warn-virginia-school-district-may-ban-public-comment-opposing-gender-identity-policy-214710/"}

Researchers Landon Schnabel of Indiana University and Sean Bock of Harvard found that the U.S. \"remains an exceptional outlier and potential counter example\" to that thesis.\n\nAnd the reason for this is because of the degree of seriousness and the particular kind of faith that Americans believe and practice.\n\nThe Federalist noted Monday that mainline Protestant churches are indeed declining rapidly but that does not mean people are abandoning faith altogether; they are going somewhere else, often more distinctly evangelical congregations.\n\n\"Because of this shifting, other very different kinds of churches are holding strong in crowds and have been for as long as such data has been collected. In some ways, they are even growing. This is what this new research has found.\"\n\nFor the past 50 years, the percentage of Americans who pray every day, attend church once a week or more, and who believe the Bible to be reliable and bring it to bear on their lives has remained steady, patently persisting to this very day. The United States stands in stark contrast with respect to faith in that approximately one in three Americans prays multiple times a day, whereas only one in 15 does in other comparable nations on average.\n\nOne in three Americans also believes that the Bible is God's Word. Less than 1 in 10 in other industrial nations on average believes the same. Americans attend religious services at rates that are twice as high as the next highest-attending industrial country, and three times higher than the average comparable country, the researchers found.\n\nMeanwhile, other polling organizations have reported findings that supplement the idea that despite much talk in recent years, American Christianity is not shrinking. Pew noted in 2015 that nondenominational evangelical churches are growing significantly and that black Protestant churches have remained mostly stable and have even seen an uptick.\n\nConsiderable media attention has been paid to young people \u2014 millennials in particular \u2014 who are leaving church in supposedly sky-high numbers but even that requires deeper analysis.\n\nAmong the young adults who left their faith, only 11 percent said they had strong faith during their childhood whereas 89 percent recounted they hailed from a home where faith was weak in belief and practice, according to Pew.\n\nSchnabel and Bock's research coheres with other recent findings from distinguished scholars at Baylor University.\n\nJ. Gordon Melton, a professor of American religious history at the Waco, Texas, school contended in November 2015 that \"[w]hile some churches have lost membership over the last 65 years, simultaneously, hundreds of new denominations have been founded, and while population has more than doubled, church membership has more than quadrupled.\"\n\n\"It is still in an upward trajectory.\"\n\nAmong the most talked-about demographics in polling focused on religious viewpoints and identification are the \"nones\" \u2014 those who do not identify with any particular religious tradition whatsoever. Melton argued it is a mistake to equate them with the irreligious.\n\n\"That's not the case,\" he asserted.\n\n\"We have a large segment of the 'nones' who are atheists and irreligious, but we have a large segment that fall into spiritual but not religious category ... The largest group are ones who say Christianity is not a religion.\"", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/christianity-patently-persisting-not-shrinking-in-us-unlike-other-developed-nations-study-214840/"}

The ultra-long-range business jet can accommodate up to four crew members and 14 passengers in an executive configuration, according to Gulfstream. It is unclear how much Copeland's ministry paid for the jet but AV Buyer says they currently have the lowest priced Gulfstream V on the market priced at just under $6 million.\n\n\"Father we thank you so and I'm asking you now sir, according to your word, bless our partners beyond measure. Yes, in the name of Jesus. For you said in 2002, 'I'm sending you new partners who are very strong financially and they will obey me. And I will increase your longtime partners and they will obey me,\" Copeland, 81, said in a prayer of thanksgiving for the new jet.\n\n\"And you will not come short. And you will not fail. And you will not lack. And you will not come behind and you will not be diminished. Praise God,\" he said of his donors.\n\nOn the December 29, 2015, television broadcast of \"Believers Voice of Victory,\" hosted by Copeland and Jesse Duplantis, the ministers explained that private jets were important to their business to help them, among other things, pray in privacy as the Lord leads and avoid unnecessary demons.\n\n\"We've got to have this! The mess that the airlines are in today. I would have to stop \u2014 I'm being very conservative \u2014 at least, 75-80, more like 90 percent of what we are doing. Because we can't get there! That's why we are on that airplane. We can talk to God!\" Copeland said.\n\n\"Now, Oral [Roberts] used to fly airlines. But even back then it got to the place where it was agitating his spiritual. People coming up to him, he had become famous, and they wanting him to pray for them and all that,\" Copeland explained. \"You can't, you can't manage that today. This dope-filled world, and get in a long tube with a bunch of demons. And it's deadly.\n\n\"I wanted to make that clear so the devil can't lie to you and say, 'See them there preachers spending all that money, just fat cats riding around.' No, we're not; we're in business,\" Copeland said.\n\nAccording to Charlie Bollinger, Kenneth Copeland Ministries' partner and volunteer, \"the Holy Spirit confirmed to Brother Copeland that the Gulfstream V was the plane the Lord had set aside for KCM.\" The ministry identified the seller of the jet as filmmaker Tyler Perry. The jet was purchased and \"paid in full\" during Thanksgiving week.\n\nWhile the newly acquired Gulfstream V jet \"is in outstanding condition and is an exceptional value,\" Bollinger said it will need $2.5 million in upgrades to meet new FAA standards.\n\n\"So, as Elite CX Team members, we need to set our faith NOW on receiving that additional seed so that we can sow it within the next three to four months, as the upgrades are completed,\" Bollinger urged Copeland's donors.\n\nHe further noted that an additional $17 million was necessary to help maintain the new aircraft and urged donors to prepare to give that amount as well.\n\n\"Beyond the purchase of the Gulfstream V and its upgrades, remember that the overall Mission 3 goal is $17 million. By sowing the balance of those funds as the CX Team, we will be sowing toward: the construction of a new hangar, upgrading the existing runway, and purchasing special GV maintenance equipment,\" he said.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/kenneth-copeland-acquires-new-gulfstream-v-jet-seeks-19-5m-for-upgrades-and-maintenance-214408/"}

The selected stories included immigrants nervous about changes to DACA, the imminent bursting of the megachurch bubble, the impact of the \u201cNashville Statement\u201d and a same-sex couple chosen to lead a historic Baptist church.\n\nChristianity Today rolled out a list of 20 top stories of 2017, among them some high-profile abuse-related scandals, Houston churches battling Hurricane Harvey flooding and the Eugene Peterson same-sex marriage flap.\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to imagine a list more astonishing than the Religion News Association\u2019s Top 10 Religion Stories of the Year poll, which was published Dec. 14. Any one of the top four could hardly have been believed 12 months earlier.\n\nRNA\u2019s rankings start with the strong presence of conservative evangelicals in the Donald Trump administration. That includes Vice President Mike Pence and the president\u2019s informal religious advisory body.\n\nImages of its members, many of them high-profile Southern Baptist ministers, laying hands on and praying for Trump have become iconic.\n\nNext, RNS lists the white-supremacist march in Charlottesville, Va. and the faith-based counter protests. Trump\u2019s words and actions following the events shocked many.\n\nThe president continues to dominate U.S. religion news with his anti-Muslim actions and rhetoric coming in third on the RNA list. The organization includes the president\u2019s Muslim travel ban, the airport protests against it, as well as his continued inflammatory social media posts and retweeting of anti-Muslim videos.\n\nTrump\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, \u201cwhile calling for continued access to Christian, Jewish and Muslim holy sites,\u201d was number four.\n\nThe persecution of Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar rounds out the top-5 in the RNA list.\n\nFilling out the top 10, in order, were: the killing of 26 church goers in Sutherland Springs, Texas; Roy Moore winning the GOP senatorial nomination in Alabama (the poll was taken before the election Moore lost); Trump\u2019s placement of conservatives on the federal bench; black NFL players citing their faith to protest racial injustice; and the 500th anniversary of the Reformation.\n\nIt lists another 17 stories that did not make the cut, including faith-inspired opposition to ending the \u201cDreamers\u201d act, the rise of hate crimes and Trump\u2019s support of religious-liberty exemptions in LGBTQ cases.\n\nRNA members also voted Donald Trump as Religion Newsmaker of the Year \u201cafter his inauguration triggered upheaval across a number of religious fronts, among them the role of evangelical support of his administration; fierce debates over Islam, race and religious liberty; the appointment of conservative Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch; and executive orders relating to immigration and terrorism.\u201d\n\nRunners-up for the designation included Martin Luther, Roy Moore, Moral Mondays leader William J.

Add your two cents.\n\nHeadline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!\n\nBY EDWARD CLINE / FAMILY SECURITY MATTERS\n\nHere is the unofficial, malign preamble to the globalist takeover of the world. It could just as well suffice as a warning of Islamic conquest, as well. Parodying the Outer Limits intro from 1995, the preamble would go:\n\nThere is nothing wrong with your television.\n\nDo not attempt to adjust the picture.\n\nWe are controlling the transmission.\n\nWe control the horizontal and the vertical.\n\nWe can confuse you with a thousand channels.\n\nOr expand one single image to crystal clarity\u2026.and beyond.\n\nOr we can blur a single image.\n\nWe can shape your vision to anything our imagination can conceive.\n\nWe control all that you see, and hear.\n\nWe will control everything, and especially your mind.\n\nWe will obliterate individual and independent thought.\n\nWe will determine the content of your mind.\n\nWe will determine what is permissible to speak, write, and express.\n\nWe will define what is and is not truth.\n\nAll that with the assistance of Facebook, Twitter, and Google. Tom Blumer wrote in his November 19th article, \u201cTwitter to Begin Using \u2018Blue Check\u2019 Status As a \u2018Big Brother\u2019 Weapon?\u201d:\n\nThe growth in online censorship by tech titans Facebook, Twitter, and Google\u2019s search and YouTube platform is one of the most under-reported stories of the past two years.\n\nIn the latest disturbing development, Twitter, which has been increasingly heavy-handed in censoring center-right content, content providers, and everyday users since last year\u2019s general election campaign, has announced that it will unilaterally remove \u201cblue-check\u201d (i.e., \u201cverified\u201d) status from groups and users who in its view have violated its Terms of Service \u2014 even for offline behavior it considers unacceptable\u2026.\n\nSo-called \u201chate speech,\u201d assuming anyone can even define it, is protected by the First Amendment. If Twitter is choosing to use the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2018s twisted definition of \u201chate speech\u201d or \u201chate groups\u201d or is taking a similar posture, a wide swath of legitimate center-right groups\u2019 blue checks may disappear. One can be certain that users losing a blue check will be on an internal Twitter \u201cwatch list\u201d for supposedly inappropriate online or offline activity that would cause the company to ban them.\n\nDemocracy Alliance and Islam want to ban \u201chate speech.\u201d They want to ban snipe hunts.\n\nOn November 17th, Brent Scher and Joe Schoffstall reported in their article, \u201cSecretive Liberal Donor Summit Increases Security, Changes Itinerary Following Free Beacon Report,\u201d in the Washington Free Beacon, that:\n\nMembers of the Democracy Alliance, a secretive dark money liberal donor network, appear to have moved to increase security presence and alter its schedule at its fall donor summit following a Washington Free Beacon report released Friday morning based off the group\u2019s internal documents.\n\nThe high-dollar progressive donors, who each vow to direct at least $200,000 in funding to approved left-wing groups of the alliance, are currently gathered at the posh La Costa Resort located in Carlsbad, Calif., for its three-day fall investment conference to plot their 2018 \u201cresistance\u201d and game plan\u2026\n\nThe Free Beacon, who appears to be the only member of the media on site covering the conference, has obtained internal documents meant only for attendees that detail the conference\u2019s agenda and those who are currently at the gathering. Janell Ross, a Washington Post reporter, is allegedly at the summit, but is listed as being on a \u201cgetting the economic narrative right\u201d panel at the conference.\n\nIslam is insinuating itself into the globalist strategy, or already has, to judge by the numerous Congressmen, billionaires, and Muslim \u201crights\u201d advocates who have been befriended by CAIR, the ISNA, the MPAC, and other Islamic or Muslim Brotherhood (MB) affiliated groups, and who do not fear Islam but are reluctant to blame Islam for any massacre Islam or ISIS claims credit for (except for Muslims or converts to Islam who are \u201cmentally\u201d troubled). Islam will be the sole globalist power. Not the secular deep state personnel or any secularist, national government. America is the MB\u2019s special target of conquest, per the Explanatory Memorandum on the General Strategic Goal for the Brotherhood in North America of 1991.\n\nIn part the Memorandum reads:\n\nEnablement of Islam in North America, meaning: establishing an effective and stable Islamic Movement led by the Muslim Brotherhood which adopts Muslims\u2019 causes domestically and globally, and which works to expand the observant Muslim base, aims at unifying and directing Muslims\u2019 efforts, presents Islam as a civilization alternative, and supports the global Islamic state, wherever it is.\n\nIn order for Islam and its Movement to become \u201ca part of the homeland\u201d in which it lives, \u201cstable\u201d in its land, \u201crooted\u201d in the spirits and minds of its people, \u201cenabled\u201d in the live [sic] of its society and has firmly-established \u201corganizations\u201d on which the Islamic structure is built and with which the testimony of civilization is achieved, the Movement must plan and struggle to obtain \u201cthe keys\u201d and the tools of this process in carry [sic] out this grand mission as a \u201cCivilization Jihadist\u201d responsibility which lies on the shoulders of Muslims and \u2013 on top of them \u2013 the Muslim Brotherhood in this country.\n\nThe process of settlement is a \u201cCivilization-Jihadist Proecess\u201d with all the word means. The Ikhwan must understand that their work in America is a kind of grand Jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and \u201csabotaging\u201d its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and God\u2019s religion is made victorious over all other religions. Without this level of understanding, we are not up to this challenge and have not prepared ourselves for Jihad yet. It is a Muslim\u2019s destiny to perform Jihad and work wherever he is and wherever he lands until the final hour comes, and there is no escape from that destiny except for those who chose to slack. But, would the slackers and the Mujahedeen be equal.\n\nIslam infests nations just as Progressivism has saddled the U.S. with a welfare/regulatory state. It has frog-marched Europe and is strangling it in the choke-hold of altruist morality. Islam holds Europe and Britain to Christianity\u2019s standard of moral goodness and activism of sacrificing itself to an invasion of hordes of unassimilable Muslims and \u201crespecting\u201d Islam, by incrementally introducing and enforcing Sharia law, and by prohibiting all criticism of Islam, under pain of fines and/or jail. When non-Muslim governments fall down on that job, Islam reserves the option of acting itself to bring about obedience and submission, \u201cIslam\u201d meaning submission.\n\nProgressivism aims for the same goal, a populace subdued and policed by a \u201chigher authority,\u201d in public and in one\u2019s mind. This is why the left and Islam are partners in conquest.\n\nHerbert Croly (1869\u20131930), was the early 20th century champion of Progressivism. He threaded together all the disparate ambitions and manifestations of Progressive thought (wages, women\u2019s rights, etc.) and presented them in what turned out to be the \u201cbiblical\u201d expression of the political philosophy in The Promise of American Life (1909). Croly\u2019s ideas were also instrumental in shaping President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal.\n\nSidney Pearson, Professor Emeritus, Radford University, of The Heritage Foundation, explains the appeal of Progressivism to the current political and business elites:\n\nWhat gave the Progressive movement its theoretical unity, in spite of internal quarrels among various writers, thinkers, and politicians, was its uniform opposition to the founding principles of the American regime. Progressives opposed the natural law and natural rights arguments of the Declaration of Independence in favor of a political science founded on historical evolution. The metaphors were typically Darwinian, and the substance was derived from German\u2013Hegelian historicism.\n\nThe Progressive movement aimed at nothing less than the total and complete transformation of the American regime. In Croly\u2019s words, \u201cThe best that can be said on behalf of this traditional American system of ideas is that it contained the germ of better things.\u201d\n\nIn practice, this meant a criticism of the Founders\u2019 idea of limited government with enumerated powers. In electoral politics, as it was expressed by writers such as Herbert Croly, Progressive democracy was built on an increased concentration of political power, primarily in the executive.\n\nThe Progressive movement aimed at nothing less than the total and complete transformation of the American regime. From one of freedom of thought, expression, and action and the liberty to pursue, unimpeded, one\u2019s own happiness, to a social environment in which the individual is corralled, fettered, and regulated in a collective for the \u201cpublic good\u201d or for the Islamic collective. This goal differs little from the Islamic goal of establishing universal Sharia Law overseeing a global Ummah of all Muslims and a state of servitude for all non-Muslims.\n\nThe Religious Tolerance site a concise definition of Sharia Law:\n\nThe term \u201cSharia\u201d (a.k.a. Shari\u2019a) literally means \u201cthe path to a watering hole.\u201d The Guardian newspaper in the UK describes Sharia as: \u201c\u2026 a religious code for living, in the same way that the Bible offers a moral system for Christians.\u201d It is used to refer both to the Islamic system of law and the totality of the Islamic way of life.\n\nIslam in the jihadist sense means perpetual warfare against unbelievers until they are conquered or extinguished. Conquest of the unbelievers is its essential \u201ccode for living.\u201d It is not about sacrifice or self-sacrifice, as a Christian duty. Its \u201cstruggle\u201d is not, as is commonly assumed, an internal one, but a ceaseless one against a world of unbelievers to achieve \u201cperfection\u201d as a Muslim and to win eternal bliss in an afterlife in Allah\u2019s Paradise.\n\nOn the other hand, there is the century-old Progressive jihad against America to \u201ctransform\u201d it into a socialist, and, inevitably, a fascist polity in which the individual must submit to the state or the collective or be deemed a \u201cnon-person.\u201d As in Islam, there is no \u201ceither/or\u201d alternative. And as with Mussolini\u2019s Fascism, \u201cAll within the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state,\u201d it is the same with Islam. A global caliphate would demand the same all-encompassing rule. \u201cAll within Sharia, nothing outside it, nothing against it.\u201d To Islam, man-made laws are an abomination. The term \u201cdemocracy\u201d is also an anathema to Islam. Islam is a totalitarian system, root, branch, and twig. Islam and Progressives want no truck with democracy (or majority rule). Progressivism, too, is totalitarian in nature. It means a rule of \u201celites,\u201d of self-appointed rulers who believe they know best for everyone, from cribs to diets to careers, to the kind of spouse one marries\n\nIs there a difference between the proposed systems? Between the goals of Islam and the leftist organizations such as the Democracy Alliance?\n\nNone that I can fathom. To Progressives the State is Allah. The State is what everyone is expected to worship and swear allegiance to, not some mystical deity.\n\nThe Free Beacon noted about the Carlsbad synod of wealthy Progressives:\n\nThe DA\u2019s agenda, titled \u201cBeyond #Resistance: Reclaiming our Progressive Future,\u201d establishes \u201cparticipation guidelines\u201d that include guests not sharing any of the members\u2019 names with the press or on social media. It also asks attendees to refrain from leaving any sensitive materials behind.\n\nFriday\u2019s headliners include liberal billionaire George Soros, who was introduced by a video message from Sen. Kamala Harris (D., Calif.), and House Democratic Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who is scheduled to speak at the network\u2019s dinner. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) also delivered a video message to the group.\n\nDavid Brock, the former conservative investigative reporter turned Clinton ally and founder of Media Matters, DCCC chair Rep. Ben Ray Lujan (D., N.M.), CNN contributor Van Jones, Center for American Progress CEO Neera Tanden, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, California politician Sandra Fluke, and others, are also at the summit, according to the agenda.\n\nTom Steyer, a billionaire environmental activist and past prominent member of the alliance, who is currently in the midst of launching a campaign geared at impeaching President Donald Trump, does not appear to be at the gathering. Pelosi, who is in attendance at the summit, previously lambasted Steyer for the campaign.\n\nHowever, Sky Gallegos, the political director of NextGen Climate, Steyer\u2019s group, is listed in the group\u2019s documents as having participated in a lunch program Thursday on \u201cmobilizing the electorate for a progressive future.\u201d\n\nSoros, of course, is helping to destroy Europe for the sake of destroying it, and is determined to do the same to America and all of Western Civilization, turning it all into one big Islamic hellhole. He is ruled by pure malice. Yet, he is called a humanitarian and philanthropist.\n\nJoe Schoffstall penned a follow-up piece on the billionaire wannabe Caliphs in his November 21st article for the Free Beacon, \u201cLiberal Millionaires Group Seeks to \u2018Fundamentally Reset\u2019 America\u2019s Ideology and Economy.\u201d\n\nA group of deep-pocketed progressive millionaires seeks to \u201cfundamentally reset\u201d America\u2019s ideology and economy and \u201cexpose the dogma of free enterprise, limited government, and traditional family values,\u201d according to a brochure obtained by the Washington Free Beacon at a secretive progressive dark money donor conference.\n\nThe group, called Patriotic Millionaires, is a Washington, D.C.-based organization that consists of wealthy liberals with an income of at least $1 million. The organization initially formed in 2010 to \u201cdemand an end to Bush tax cuts for millionaires\u201d and has launched a recent campaign against the Republican tax cut plan.\n\nPatriotic Millionaires\u2019s newest organizational overview, which is not the same brochure that is currently available on its website, was obtained by the Free Beacon at the Democracy Alliance\u2019s fall investment conference held last week at the swanky La Costa Resort in Carlsbad, Calif. Each Democracy Alliance member vows to steer hundreds of thousands in funding to approved left-wing organizations the group supports.\n\nThe Patrotic Millionaires site boasts:\n\nThe group is chaired by Morris Pearl, a former Blackrock executive who retired 3 and a half years ago after a long career on Wall Street to work with the Patriotic Millionaires full time. Patriotic Millionaires members include investors and business owners from across the country engaged in a wide array of industries. Our members include: David desJardins, the #20 employee at Google; legendary venture capitalist Alan Patricof, New York psychologist Gail Furman; filmmaker Abigail Disney; technologist Steve Silberstein; billionaire medical device heiress Pat Stryker; investor Lawrence Benenson of Benenson Capital Partners; textile entrepreneur Great Neck Richman; philanthropist Molly Munger; corrugated cardboard magnate Dennis Mehiel and media investor Leo Hindery, Jr. among many others.\n\nProud \u201ctraitors to their class,\u201d members of the Patriotic Millionaires are high-net worth Americans, business leaders, and investors who are united in their concern about the destabilizing concentration of wealth and power in America. The mission of The Patriotic Millionaires organization is to build a more stable, prosperous, and inclusive nation by promoting public policies based on the \u201cfirst principles\u201d of equal political representation, a guaranteed living wage for all working citizens, and a fair tax system:\n\nAll citizens should enjoy political power equal to that enjoyed by millionaires;\n\nAll citizens who work full time should be able to afford their basic needs;\n\nTax receipts from millionaires, billionaires and corporations should comprise a greater proportion of federal tax receipts.\n\nThose points are but window dressing, the labored calligraphy of Progressivism meant to dazzle the gullible and guilty among \u201cthe little people.\u201d The members of Democracy Alliance and Patriotic Millionaires are but limousine social justice warriors. Again, I discern no political-end difference between the virtue-signaling members of Democracy Alliance and Patriotic Millionaires and the belligerent hubris of Islam. As Anne Coulter once said, the limousine social justice warriors are but modern \u201cDruids\u201d who worship a pagan god and fly thousands of miles in gas guzzling private jets to speak about global warming. Islam worships an imaginary \u201csuperior\u201d god made out of the whole cloth of a hijab or kufi.\n\nBoth sets seek unquestionable power to tell you what to think, what to say, and how to live. They want their Outer Limits.\n\nhttp://familysecuritymatters.org/publications/detail/elites-globalist-manifesto-of-rules\n\nRead more great articles here: http://familysecuritymatters.org\n\nEdward Cline is the author of the Sparrowhawk novels set in England and Virginia in the pre-Revolutionary period, of several detective and suspense novels, and three collections of his commentaries and columns, all available on Amazon Books.

Add your two cents.\n\nHeadline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!\n\nby N.Morgan\n\nThe victims of the Hollywood sex abuse scandals are finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and may get the justice they\u2019ve long deserved.\n\nHowever, a negative consequence of those scandals surfacing, as the \u201cWeinsteins and the Spaceys\u201d watch their careers crash and burn over the numerous allegations of sexual misconduct, other sex abuse crimes are being virtually ignored by mainstream media, sexual misconduct that is being perpetrated by police officers.\n\nNearly on a daily basis a cop or former cop\u2019s face makes the local newspaper with obscure headlines like Former Deputy Now Charged with Exploitation.\n\nThere is hardly any attention is given to these stories despite the horrifying nature of the crimes alleged.\n\nFor example, the aforementioned headline is from a small Minnesota town and involves a deputy who was arrested on multiple felony charges including child molestation, sexual misconduct with a child, and child exploitation.\n\nNo other media outlets picked up the story and the disgusting crimes that led to these headlines happen far more frequently than reported.\n\nEalier this month, two NYPD cops crimes were so bad that they actually made national headlines when they were arrested for allegedly handcuffing an underage teen and brutally raping her in their van.\n\nWhile Chambers and her mother were at the hospital, nine officers showed up to intimidate them into remaining silent about the violent assault.\n\n\u201cThey came with nine cops to intimidate her and her mom, to discourage them from coming forward and reporting the rape and sex assault,\u201d attorney Michael David, told The Post.\n\nSo as the NYPD case garnered much-needed attention, others go completely unnoticed and under reported. Cops sexually abusing children, women, and men is common and is a major problem.\n\nIn 2014, TFTP put out a shocking report that highlighted 40 cops who were convicted or charged with spousal abuse, child rape, or other types of sex crimes just thirty days.\n\nIndependent researchers began tracking how many people are killed by cops every year, no one was tracking how many crimes were committed by cops. However, that is beginning to change, and the data shows that the problem is staggering.\n\nLast year, a study exposed the shocking fact that police officers are arrested about 1,100 times a year, or roughly three officers charged every day. Many of these arrests are over unspeakable sex crimes.\n\n\u201cPolice crimes are not uncommon,\u201d the study\u2019s lead researcher Philip M. Stinson concluded. \u201cOur data directly contradicts some of the prevailing assumptions and the proposition that only a small group of rotten apples perpetrate the vast majority of police crime.\u201d\n\nAlthough nearly 60 percent of the crimes \u201coccurred when the officer was technically off-duty,\u201d Stinson wrote, \u201ca significant portion of these so-called off-duty crimes also lies within the context of police work and the perpetrator\u2019s role as a police officer, including instances where off-duty officers flash a badge, an official weapon, or otherwise use their power, authority, and the respect afforded to them as a means to commit crime.\u201d\n\nA report done by WaPo found that in cases involving allegations of sexual abuse, 72 percent of the officers were fired, and more than 80 percent resulted in convictions, the study found.\n\nThere were 422 reported cases of forcible and statutory rape, 352 cases of forcible fondling and 94 sodomy cases over the seven years of the study, which Stinson called \u201clarger than expected based on the existing research.\u201d\n\nThe data search turned up 174 examples of male officers arrested in cases of \u201cDriving While Female,\u201d in which women drivers were harassed or assaulted. About 82 percent of those cases ended in convictions.\n\nA separate study as reported by the AP in 2015 found similarly startling numbers.\n\nAP\u2019s probe revealed that 550 officers lost their certification status for various sexual assaults, including rape.\n\nSome were dismissed for sodomy or sexual shakedowns, where victims were forced to perform sexual acts to avoid arrest.\n\nAnother 440 officers lost their jobs for other sex-related offenses, such as possessing child pornography, being a peeping Tom, sending sexually charged messages to underage teens or having sex while on duty.\n\nAbout one-third of the officers lost their jobs for committing sexual offenses with juveniles.\n\nIn yet another independent study concluded that sexual misconduct is the second highest of all complaints nationwide against police officers, representing 9.3 percent in 2010, according to a study by the Cato Institute\u2019s National Police Misconduct Reporting Project.\n\nIn 2010, 354 of the 618 complaints involved nonconsensual sexual acts, and over half of those involved were minors.\n\nPerhaps the most chilling aspect of police sexual misconduct is the likelihood of the media remaining silence on the crimes.\n\nAs in the case of the NYPD cops intimidating the rape victim shows, police officers stand up for their own\u2014even if it means protecting a rapist.\n\nWhen a person becomes a victim of police sex crimes, how can they be expected to go to the very people who employ their abuser and report it \u2014 especially given the fact that it is well known police will go to great lengths to protect their own.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s happening probably in every law enforcement agency across the country,\u201d said Chief Bernadette DiPino of the Sarasota Police Department in Florida, who helped study the problem for the International Association of Chiefs of Police.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so underreported and people are scared that if they call and complain about a police officer, they think every other police officer is going to be then out to get them.\u201d\n\nWhile it is certainly newsworthy to expose Hollywood pedophiles and sex abusers for preying on vulnerable actors and actresses, the level at which police sexual misconduct is ignored by the media is shameful.\n\nHas the stranglehold of the Police State gotten so tight that it is considered treacherous to even mention the staggering rate at which police commit sex crimes against the citizenry?\n\nHas the Blue Line become an invisible monster that no longer represents justice, but conceals the very predators they swore to protect us from?\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://thefreethoughtproject.com/hollywood-steals-spotlight-americans-forget-sex-abuse-police/\n\nhttp://thefreethoughtproject.com/cops-intimidate-teen-rape-victim/\n\nhttp://thefreethoughtproject.com/2-cops-arrested-sexual-assault-child/\n\nhttps://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/249850.pdf\n\nMore Stories Contributed By N.

That's a shock, especially with someone who's always been as healthy as dad,\" he continued.\n\nThe son said they made the video so that people can join them in prayer. Luis then shared his heart concerning everything.\n\n\"I haven't been in a hospital one night except for when I broke a bone back in 1984 after missions from London,\" the esteemed Argentinian evangelist shared.\n\n\"To me, the first thing you do is cry. I think 'oh wow, I can be gone in a few months' and one silly thought that came to mind is that I won't be able to pick up the phone and talk to the boys and hear their voice and talk to my wife,\" Luis emotionally shared.\n\n\"This is sad, I don't feel panic or horror, if [I'm] healed, hallelujah! And many people are praying that the Lord will do a miracle. It would take literally a miracle medically speaking. Stage 4 is big time.\"\n\nHe went on to say that the peace he felt immediately was that at least 10 years ago he elected his son, Kevin, to be president of the ministry and Andrew is an anointed evangelist.\n\n\"So everything is ready and if the Lord wants to take me home in the next two months or two years, then I'm ready,\" the loving father maintained as his sons looked at him with heartbroken smiles.\n\nLuis said he's going to continue living one day at a time and despite the sad prognosis he still feels good.\n\nHe shared the scripture that has been keeping him encouraged: Isaiah 41:10, which says, \"Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my victorious righteous right arm.\"\n\n\"I know the Lord is with me, by the Holy Spirit indwelling, He is with us, we go through it, we go into the presence of the lord,\" Luis testified.\n\nHe also shared 2 Timothy 4 where the apostle Paul says, \"the time for my departure is here.\"\n\nThe 83-year-old began to cry as he thought about leaving his family but he did say he still intends to complete the mission trips they have planned throughout the world for this year as God gives him the strength.\n\n\"Thank you for your prayers, thank you for loving us, thank you for your support,\" Luis said as he ended his portion.\n\nAndrew concluded the video by saying that he's had many restless nights the past couple of days.\n\n\"I got up and read my Proverbs early and couldn't wait to come up and see your face,\" he told his dad.\n\nHe then quoted Proverbs 15, which says, \"The evidence of a happy heart is a cheerful face.\"\n\n\"To think that you're facing what you're facing and day by day we see your happy face, it's proof that you're at peace,\" Andrew stated.\n\n\"We beg you to pray for dad and mom,\" he asked viewers.\n\nLuis has been in ministry for more than 50 years. The Palau Association has collaborated with thousands of churches in hundreds of cities around the world in his life to this point. He's made an impact in top global cities: London, Hong Kong, Singapore, Chicago, Moscow, Madrid, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Washington, D.C., and more.\n\nThis reporter was in attendance in 2015 as he rallied 1,000 New York City churches together to make history in the Big Apple. It was one of the biggest evangelical moves in New York City as approximately 60,000 people gathered to hear the Gospel and worship. The Palau Association has coordinated hundreds of citywide campaigns just like it in dozens of nations, including major evangelistic festivals on all five continents.\n\nTo stay up to date on Luis' condition, go to Palau.org.

When her daughter told the church who her abuser was, however, Lawrence's mother exploded from her seat and threatened her child with death from God and the \"blood of Jesus.\"\n\n\"The devil! My God! God will kill you for that!\" Lawrence's mother screamed with a thick Jamaican accent.\n\n\"I was raped at 8-and-a-half years old.

My mom came to me two days ago. My mom was raped.

I shouldn't say what He delivered me from because my testimony is too raw and too real for the saints who watch fights on 'Love and Hip Hop.' You don't want to hear what God has done, you just want to hear what He is doing. Stop treating church like Disney World \u2014 that everybody's testimony got to be pretty and polished. And understand that some testimonies are ugly, nasty, vile, dirty, but that's the wonder-working power of His grace. The wonder-working power of His love.\"\n\nThe name of the church in the latest video appears to be Agape Life based on screen displays but its location was not immediately known. The Christian Post was unable to verify what happened after the woman's testimony was abruptly ended.\n\nMany people do not appear to agree with the way in which the church handled the testimony based on the most popular reactions to the video.\n\n\"This is so common in many households where mothers turn a blind eye to sexual abuse because they fear being alone. I am proud of this woman and she needs to remove herself from that s***hole of a church,\" wrote Claros Agnatic Morean in a comment that has garnered more than 1,000 reactions.\n\n\"I don't need to know her. I grew up and live in the Caribbean in a Caribbean household,\" wrote Eboni Brandon of Lawrence. \"This s*** happens and our families act blind, deaf and dumb and would rather not deal with it. And this doesn't just happen in homes where mothers are turning a blind eye for a buck from a man.

What is happening with bloggers and social media critics being so hateful is also wrong,\" Conlee told his congregation Sunday about church sexual assault advocates who have been criticizing the way Savage's past was kept secret from his congregation.\n\nSavage's accuser, Jules Woodson, revealed in a report highlighted in The Wartburg Watch earlier this month, how he coerced her into performing oral sex on him while he was her then 22-year-old youth pastor at Woodlands Parkway Baptist Church, now known as StoneBridge Church 20 years ago.\n\nShe alleged that even though he was fired from the church over the incident, what he did was not fully disclosed and she was told by church officials to keep quiet about what had happened to her. Months later, Savage was back in ministry in Memphis and his past was shared with only a few people, including Conlee.\n\nSavage has since argued of his encounter with Woodson that \"I did not force anything. I did not ask for anything. I did not request anything. This was a very mutual organic moment that we shared.\"\n\nSince The Wartburg Watch's initial report, many critics have suggested that Savage should not be in a leadership position with his past.\n\nConlee has defended Savage, saying he has \"total confidence in the redemptive process Andy went through under his leadership in Texas\" and that he's \"100 percent committed\" to Savage and his continued ministry at Highpoint.\n\nIn his latest comments on Sunday, Conlee dismissed some sources of information as \"unreliable.\"\n\n\"So let me ask you this question: Why is Bible reading so selective? Matthew 7:2 says this: 'For in the way you judge, you will be judged, and by your standard of measure, it will be measured to you. 'And so what I would ask for us to be a people to do, is it is okay for us to acknowledge when wrong has existed, but it's also okay for us to acknowledge that there are some sources in life that are not reliable or responsible. It is okay for us to respectfully disagree, and that's what we're doing,\" Conlee said.\n\n\"If you were watching a movie right now of this story, and in this particular movie we happen to be the main characters, what would you want us to do? Do you want us to compromise and cave in to the critics? Do you want us to quit? See, that's what the enemy wants,\" he told the church, noting that he intended to respond to the crisis in the way Jesus would.\n\n\"What you want us to do is to be people of incredible integrity, you want us to be people who are sold out, committed, to doing everything we possibly can to respond the way Jesus would respond, to speak truth in love, to have that perfect balance and tension that exists there.\n\n\"Here's what I want you to know: As your leader, as your pastor, I am committed to fighting the good fight. But watch this \u2014 don't get mistaken about the word fight \u2014 I'm committed to fighting the good fight, in the right way, at the right time, with the right heartbeat. Okay?\" he said.\n\nHe then urged his congregants to be mindful of the devil while quoting 1 Peter 5:8.\n\n\"Be sober-minded. Be watchful. Your adversary, the Devil, prowls around \u2014 watch this \u2014 like, like a roaring lion. He is not a roaring lion. He is like a roaring lion. There is only one roaring lion, and that is the lion of the tribe of Judah,\" Conlee said. \"You know what he does? He imitates in order to intimidate.

He just said I wasn't welcome here and if I chose to stay I would be charged with criminal trespassing and arrested,\" Staley said.\n\nThe move comes after two Southern Acres Christian Church members alleged in a lawsuit last November that Pastor Cameron McDonald mismanaged church funds, according to the Lexington Herald Leader.\n\nConcerned church members James Keogh and Chad Martin filed the lawsuit to prevent McDonald and his wife, Erica, from spending church money or making any real estate transfers. They alleged that he concentrated power and financial authority among himself, his wife and another staffer.\n\nMcDonald, who took over the church in 2006, was allegedly able to acquire power by dissolving a larger governing board, altering the church's operating rules and getting rid of the need for churchwide approval votes on changes.\n\nThe suit alleged that a majority of church staff members were either fired or quit as a result of the changes.\n\nOn Friday, the lawsuit was dismissed in court because the members felt it was \"a matter the church's congregation must decide internally, prayerfully and peacefully,\" according to attorney for the members Joe Bilby.\n\n\"At least 54 members of the congregation believe Southern Acres needs a fresh start with new leadership,\" Bilby said, noting that a letter bearing their names was delivered to the general congregation on Friday. In 2006, the church had 1,000 members. It is unclear how many members remain.\n\nStaley said a number of those 54 members were blocked from attending church on Sunday.\n\n\"It's disgusting,\" Staley told the Lexington Herald Leader Monday about being turned away from his church. \"Anyone who has ever gone to a church has heard the lines, 'you are welcome; come as you are.' Even a nonbeliever knows that. To be told, 'you are not welcomed here' ... They are creating an exclusive club ... and this is not of the Christian moral values.\"\n\nAustin Wilkerson, the church's attorney, told WKYT that they were forced to block the members from attending church as a precaution because \"there were indications that there was going to be a disruption\" on Sunday.\n\n\"We're very well aware there's a lot of people who need to be heard and that there's deep reconciliation needed and the church is very happy to have the opportunity to do that,\" he said.\n\nBilby explained, \"The full congregation will have an opportunity to vote for a change in leadership on Feb. 4.\"\n\nWilkerson further noted that an independent financial review is underway, which he believes will clear McDonald's name.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/members-turned-away-from-church-as-congregants-push-to-dismiss-pastor-accused-of-misusing-church-funds-214842/"}

I share your complementarian understanding of God's design for male and female roles and relationships in the home and church,\" wrote Scott.\n\n\"On that basis, I have recently doubted whether or not my seminary ought to allow women to teach pastors in training. What do you think? Should women be hired as seminary professors? What is your best case?\"\n\nExpand | Collapse REUTERS/Brian Snyder \"Maranatha\" means \"the Lord is coming\"\n\nPiper responded that he was working on the assumption that the Bible teaches the Church must be led by \"spiritual, humble, biblically qualified men,\" referencing 1st Timothy 2:12, which reads: \"I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet.\"\n\n\"Just to be clear, the issue is not whether women should attend seminary in one of its programs and get the best biblical grounding possible,\" noted Piper. \"The issue is whether women should be models, mentors, and teachers for those preparing for a role that is biblically designed for spiritual men. That's the way I'm posing the question.\"\n\nPiper stressed that the issue was \"not the competence of women teachers or intelligence or knowledge or pedagogical skill,\" but rather \"the nature of the seminary teaching office.\"\n\n\"If it is unbiblical to have women as pastors, how can it be biblical to have women who function in formal teaching and mentoring capacities to train and fit pastors for the very calling from which the mentors themselves are excluded?\" argued Piper.\n\n\"I don't think that works. The issue is always that inconsistency. If you strive to carve up teaching in such a way that it's suitable for women, it ceases to be suitable as seminary teaching.\"\n\nPiper's comments have garnered much controversy, with author and worship leader Kaitlin Curtice posting to Twitter that she was unsurprised by the response.\n\n\"This interview reminds me of one of the pastors of my childhood, a man I dearly love but who would never value me as a leader,\" tweeted Curtice. \"So we are challenged to not only try to undo this mindset, but to constantly chip away at and mend to the brokenness of its repercussions for our society.\"\n\nCurtice then called on her male followers to post examples of female church leaders who have \"contributed most to your theology through their leadership,\" to which she received many responses.\n\n\"She then put out a call to action for men to point out some women who have positively affected men's theology, and the responses did not disappoint, referencing women both famous and not, familial and not, who shaped them and continue to lead them,\" noted Relevant magazine.\n\nOthers on social media have come to Piper's defense, including Joe Rigney, professor at Piper's Bethlehem College & Seminary.\n\nIn a series of Tweets, Rigney argues that Piper \"reframes the generic question\" of women teaching at seminaries as seeing the goal of seminary to be practical vocational training for pastors.\n\n\"[T]he best pedagogical method for such a seminary is through modeling, mentoring, and teaching for the pastoral office by professors who are qualified to fill that office,\" said Rigney in a series of tweets.\n\n\"Specifically, profs should be actively involved as elder-qualified men in a church.

They're often cited as the age group that leaves the church in droves or is less religious overall. But the director of one of the largest Christian student missions conferences wants to clarify some things.\n\nRuth Hubbard is the director of Urbana 2018. Since 1946, this global event led by InterVarsity has drawn some 300,000 people, mainly college students. She recognizes that students who are around 18 or 19 years old start \"asking a lot of hard questions about the faith of their parents and grandparents, where they are wondering 'are all the things that their parents and grandparents held as being part of the faith really what God intended?'\"\n\nBut that's natural, Hubbard told The Christian Post.\n\n\"College is an age where most of us begin to say, 'I need to push away from what my parents have always taught me, and analyze it for myself.' There is a natural kind of skepticism or questioning that is true for younger adults,\" she said.\n\nAnd while many students do reject the Christian faith, or at least some aspects of it, Hubbard clarified that a lot of times what they're rejecting is not Christianity, per se.\n\n\"Many of us have the tendency to take the culture in which we live and the faith that we hold to, and merge those things together,\" she explained. \"I think that has been particularly true for the West, and for a majority of cultures.\"\n\nThus, what the young generation is rejecting is \"not necessarily the God of the Bible, but rather this sort of mushed-up faith expression,\" where young people go, \"I think some of that has nothing to do with God.\"\n\nNotably, Hubbard said that Urbana conferences have not seen any \"dramatic drop in attendance.\" The most recent one, held in 2015, drew nearly 16,000 people. Any decrease in numbers they see is not due to a lack of interest among youths in spiritual matters, but rather \"the fact that there are more conferences that students can choose from\" now, the director noted.\n\nHelping Students Find Their Calling\n\nThe next Urbana conference will be held in St. Louis, Missouri, in December. The main mission of Urbana is to \"call generations to surrender to Christ's lordship\" and to help students find their calling and join \"the Lord's global mission whether across campus, zip codes, or the world.\"\n\nHubbard first attended Urbana in 2000. It was at that conference that she felt led to spend the next 14 years of her life serving at Wycliffe Bible Translators, which promotes literacy and helps people around the world translate the Word of God into their own languages.\n\nWhen it comes to inspiring students to find their calling, sometimes the Gospel can be oversimplified to being \"only about telling people about Jesus so they can be saved, go to Heaven and live happily ever after,\" she pointed out. But more than that, it's about living out the Gospel in every aspect of their lives.\n\nHubbard referred to the book of Matthew, where Jesus taught believers to pray \"Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done,\" and said people need to consider what that looks like in their lives.\n\n\"The Kingdom of God has come to me personally and it impacts the way I personally live, it impacts us as a community,\" she said. \"He impacts the way we live as a Church, and so that living out of the Gospel is going to be different.\n\n\"That's what we want to invite students to do, not to say 'go be seekers of justice' or 'go be seekers of compassion, make sure people are fed,' or 'go be conveyors of this message,' or 'go build the church;' but rather, 'know God, know Him deeply, know Him well, know His Word, become so engaged with Him in a relationship and with the community of people who know and love Him that the living out of every aspect of our lives is saturated with that relationship.'\"\n\nFor the younger generation, social justice causes such as sex trafficking or child poverty are often attractive. And while \"doing good is good,\" Hubbard warned against following their own sense of justice versus aligning themselves to God's plan.\n\n\"When we venture out with our own energies, with our own passion, anything we try to accomplish on our own, even for the good, can get so easily derailed,\" Hubbard said.\n\n\"It's not like doing good is a bad thing. Doing good is good! Let's make the world a better place, let's do that. But when we do it and it's not aligned with what God is doing, what God intended, what God teaches clearly in His Scripture, it can become less helpful than if we are paying attention to what God is calling us to do.\"\n\nThe Urbana director insisted that justice is the way that God designed things to be.\n\n\"There is a sense of God's justness in the world, and they will invest themselves in that,\" she said of young people.\n\n\"And if they are doing that walking with God, following after what He has called them to, that will ultimately be different and look different than when they are just going out and [following] whatever justice feels like today, and letting themselves or a generation or a fad define justice.\"\n\nHubbard said her goal as a director at Urbana is not to have a certain number of students check the box for short-term missions trips or international internships. She wants to see real transformation in students' lives.\n\n(Photo: InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA) Urbana 2015 missions conference held in St. Louis, Missouri December 27\u201331, 2015.\n\n\"My highest goal is that they can see more clearly than ever Jesus, the slain lamb on God's eternal throne, as their Savior and their Lord and their God, as all that God is to them, and from that they will be moved to a life of worship, and a life of service that brings the Kingdom,\" she said.\n\nIn the meantime, she hopes students can begin living out the Gospel now in their own context, rather than wait for an overseas opportunity.\n\n\"They need to realize that it doesn't make sense that God would call them to be an evangelist across an ocean if they are not bearing witness to who God is in their own communities,\" she pointed out.\n\n\"I don't think God is going to turn you into a missionary if you are not already thinking about 'How do I talk about God in the communities I am in?' If you are not caring for the poor in your own community, how are you going to go and suddenly care about the poor somewhere else?\" Hubbard posed.\n\n\"One of the ways in which you prepare for a lifetime of service is to begin doing service now. Inviting students to think about how they can do service outside their own communities, and for some that means reaching into international student ministries that might be on their campuses, or engaging in ministry with those who have come to their campus.\n\n\"Allowing God to work in you so that when the opportunity comes, you have already been engaging, and it will be a natural, logical step to move into the next stage,\" she said of answering the call for missions.\n\nBelow, Hubbard answers CP's questions on the mission field, how to reach people for Christ, and the influence of technology on missions. She also recounts an intriguing story she heard while she served at Wycliffe. Answers edited for clarity.\n\nCP: Is the missions field changing? Is the West coming more into focus with the rise of secularism?\n\nHubbard: God has invited us to bear witness to who He is and what He has done everywhere we go. I want to be careful and not slip into the thinking that everyone is a missionary everywhere they go. I think there is a unique role for the person who leaves their own community and crosses cultures and serves. I think there is something about that that is a part of God's plan. But we also know that God has called all of us to bear witness to who He is and what He has been doing in our lives.\n\nWherever there is a lack of witness, wherever there is darkness, we are called to bring light. We know that darkness takes on various characteristics. In some places, there is a darkness that comes mostly from ignorance, and in other places there may be a darkness that comes mostly from rebellion and rejection.\n\nThe way in which you may carry light in those places \u2014 the strategies may differ, but there is also the fact that light is light, and what we do is we reflect the light of God. God's light is already in those places, and we come and serve as a reflector of that light.\n\nHowever, it is that God created us to be this way, we often see Him in the lives of human beings around us, when we might have missed Him if it wasn't for them.\n\nThere are places on Earth where there is not a witness to God, or the witness to God is very small, it is a little, tiny flickery flame. Missions, strategies in those places is going to look very different than places where there has been a brilliant light in some points in history that has then been corrupted, or neglected, or ignored, or all the things that might happen in societies that we may call post-Christian.\n\nI think there is great room to grow in the missions field. I have asked the question recently as the church is growing in China, and there is an increased fervor among Chinese Christians for global missions, \"what does it look like for Chinese Christian university students to come and spread the Gospel in the universities in the United States?\"\n\nWe know that it's no longer \"from the West to the rest,\" it's the whole Church taking the whole Gospel to the whole world.\n\nCP: Is it more difficult to reach people for Christ in the secular world?\n\nHubbard: I haven't done extensive study or reading, and so this is a somewhat informed but not as informed as it might be though, [but] I don't know if I would characterize it as more difficult.\n\n(Photo: InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA) Urbana 2015 missions conference held in St. Louis, Missouri December 27\u201331, 2015.\n\nWhere I think we would find difficulty in any Gospel ministry, in any of the ways where we would bear witness and call people to follow Jesus, or any place where we do evangelistic kind of work, is when there is opposition. [For instance] from a secular viewpoint that no longer wants to listen, and we know that that is the experience of some. In the United States and in the West, there is a sense of \"all the voices should have a chance to speak except for the Christian voice\" \u2014 that's the one voice that's not welcome in pluralism.\n\nSo there is opposition there; there is opposition from other religions across the world; there could be opposition that is more political. [In] any kind of opposition there is challenge \u2014 that has not changed throughout all of human history.\n\nWhere we find perhaps ourselves saying \"its harder here or it's harder there\" is when there is a kind of challenge that we are not adjusted to address. If I try to take the strategy of sharing the Gospel that worked somewhere within a specific community, or a generation, or a context, and I don't adapt it at all and take it to another place where it may not work at all, and I go \"Oh, it might be so much harder to share the Gospel\" \u2014 it might not be that it's harder, it might be that it requires a different way to do that.\n\nWe may need to apply what we've learned in other places, and see \"well, how does that apply here? How do we conceptualize the Gospel for this community, for this generation; and not allow what appears to be opposition to derail us?\" There has always been opposition to the Gospel.\n\nCP: What are some trends or developments in technology in missions that the general public might be surprised by?\n\nHubbard: The general public probably won't be surprised that the use of technology in missions is growing exponentially. They might be surprised at the kind of things that technology has impacted. [There are] people who think \"let's think creatively, let's go outside of our boxes, and not just try to do what we've always done and use technology to make it better.\"\n\nWe (older generations) are still thinking in terms of documentation, where as a digital native, which is the younger generation, they are going to come in and turn it all sideways and say, \"Why does it have to look like that at all?\"\n\nFor instance, I came from the world of Bible translation, [where young people] have led to changes.\n\n[For example], in an oral culture, instead of trying to create a writing system and then translate using it, they are translating orally and then creating a writing system where a community sees that to be a positive thing for them to have.\n\nWith technology, where a person can listen to Scripture in a language that they know, other than their own heart language, they can listen to it multiple times, and then speak it back, and then you can have someone else listen to it and do the same. And it can all be done digitally with oral recordings.\n\nSo that [is a] kind of a switch in how we think about technology, and I think that is going to be led by a generation that lives inside the digital world, as they are not tied to other ways of doing things.\n\nCP: Are there memories you can share that really stand out to you where you've seen missions work inspire or lead people to change their lives?\n\nHubbard: I am reminded of a story \u2014 so the man's name is Leonard, and he's Cameroonian.\n\nHe was participating in the work, he was doing the work of translating Scripture into the language that serves him and his community best. He was using the French scriptures, and had access to English scriptures.\n\nHe was invited to read Scripture during Holy Week at their church service. So he read the story of Jesus' death and resurrection, and there was a group of women in the congregation that approached him after the service, and they were clearly emotional.\n\nThere was actually quite the response from the whole group that was gathered, that started with people becoming silent as he began to read.\n\nThe community was so used to Scripture being read in French (which they only barely understood), but when he began to read Scripture in a language they spoke, there was a silence, and there was an emotional response from the people.\n\nAnd the women who came up to him afterwards (they would have called themselves Christians), they said \"where did you get this story?\" They were almost accusing him of conjuring up some kind of story that they had never heard before.\n\nHe pulled out his French New Testament and said, \"It's in here, you hear this story every year during these services.\" [But they replied] \"No, we've never heard this story before, we never knew this.\"\n\nAnd it became to be very transformational for these specific women, but also for the community as a whole.\n\nI've heard stories like that over and over again as it relates to Scripture being available in the language that serves people best. It moves them into a life of service, which is very different [from] when it is just sort of, \"I'm going to take on this religion;\" it moves from religion to a deep relationship.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/urbana-director-why-following-gods-calling-missions-trip-212940/"}

Jail )\n\nJoin us on our podcast each weekday for an interesting story, well told, from Charisma News. Listen at charismapodcastnetwork.com.\n\nA church elder in Minnesota is at the center of a twisted tale of affairs, murder-for-hire and allegedly killing his wife when the hit fell through.\n\nStephen Allwine, a deacon in a United Church of God congregation, is on trial this week for the first-degree murder of his wife, Amy.\n\nProsecutors allege Allwine discovered the affair website Ashley Madison and then began cheating on his wife. Rather than divorce her, they say he hired Besa Mafia for $6000 to kill her and make it look like an accident. When the hit fell through, Prosecutors say Allwine murdered Amy himself in 2016.\n\nAccording to City Pages:\n\nAfter Amy was found dead later that fall, Stephen told investigators that he had no knowledge of the Dark Web. That turned out to be false, according to the criminal complaint against him, as computer forensics later found that he had been accessing the Dark Web as early as 2014, and cookies for several Tors\u2014search engines used to search the Dark Web\u2014were installed on his phone around the same time that dogdaygod [The name Allwine allegedly used online] started looking for ways to murder Amy.\n\nThe United Church of God is quite firm on divorce, and prosecutors believe this was the motive Allwine had to kill his wife.\n\n\"Couples who decide to marry are expected to know one another well enough, before they marry, in order to assess as closely as possible how they will get along after marriage. The Church strongly recommends counseling with the ministry,\" according to the church site. \"Even if couples have a short courtship, fail to counsel before marrying or have dysfunctional backgrounds, none of these recognized troubles justify the later putting away of [divorcing] a mate with the freedom to remarry. Marriage is a commitment for life. Failure to plan properly is not grounds for the future dissolving of a marriage.\"\n\nAllwine's attorney vehemently denies the allegations as something that sounds like the plot of a movie or TV show.\n\n\"Just because he had an affair doesn't mean he killed his wife,\" attorney Kevin DeVore says.\n\nadvertisement\n\nInvestigators initially ruled Amy's death as a suicide, but quickly changed their report to foul play, as several items failed to line up: The gun was found near Amy's left arm, but she was right-handed. Amy had no gun powder or other residue on her. Forensic tests also revealed bloody footprints had been cleaned up throughout the house. They also found poison in her system.\n\nBut Devore finds fault with the analysis.\n\nAccording to Twin Cities Pioneer Press:\n\nDevore questioned the credibility of the computer analyst who performed forensic examinations on Stephen Allwine's computers and said the investigation of the home had been \"contaminated.\" Police officers, Devore said, removed the gun found near Amy Allwine's body to remove bullets and take photos before returning it to its original position. Devore pointed to at least three neighbors who reported seeing Amy Allwine outside her home the night of her death and reported hearing two vehicles \"racing\" out of the neighborhood around then. He also said authorities failed to follow up on an unknown user who remotely accessed Stephen Allwine's computer the day of Amy Allwine's death.\n\nJessilyn Justice @jessilynjustice is the director of online news for Charisma.\n\nConnect with God in a deeper way as you read His Word.

( REUTERS/Brendan McDermid )\n\nJoin us on our podcast each weekday for an interesting story, well told, from Charisma News. Listen at charismapodcastnetwork.com.\n\nAs his victims wept in a Michigan courtroom on Wednesday, disgraced long-time USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar was sentenced to up to 175 years in prison for abusing young female gymnasts who were entrusted to his care.\n\n\"I've signed your death warrant,\" Ingham County Circuit Court Judge Rosemarie Aquilina told Nassar, following days of harrowing accounts from about 160 of his victims.\n\n\"It is my privilege\u2014on counts 1, 2, 5, 8, 10 and 18 and 24\u2014to sentence you to 40 years,\" Aquilina said. \"I'm going to look at my cheat sheet: 40 years, just so you know and you can count it off your calendar, is 480 months. The tail end\u2014because I need to send a message to the parole board in the event somehow God is gracious and I know He is\u2014and you survive the 60 years in federal court first and then you start on my 40 years. You've gone off the page here as to what I'm doing. My page only goes to 100 years. Sir, I'm giving you 175 years, which is 2100 months.\"\n\nSpectators and victims cried, applauded and embraced as Nassar, 54, wearing a dark blue jailhouse jumpsuit, was led out of the courtroom. Rachael Denhollander, the first woman to publicly accuse him in 2016, shared a hug with Angela Povilaitis, the lead prosecutor.\n\nNassar, who served as the program's physician through four Olympic Games, had apologized to his victims during the hearing, telling them, \"I will carry your words with me for the rest of my days.\"\n\nBut Aquilina dismissed his statement as insincere and courtroom spectators gasped as the judge read aloud from a letter he wrote to her claiming he was a good doctor who was manipulated into pleading guilty.\n\nNassar, who already is serving a 60-year sentence in federal prison for child pornography convictions, also said his accusers fabricated claims to gain money and fame and wrote, \"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.\"\n\n\"Would you like to withdraw your plea?\" Aquilina asked Nassar after tossing aside his letter with evident disgust.\n\n\"No, your honor,\" Nassar said.\n\n\"Because you are guilty, aren't you? Are you guilty, sir?\" the judge demanded.\n\nAfter a long pause, Nassar said quietly, \"I have said my plea, exactly.\"\n\nChanging View\n\nBoth the prosecution and Aquilina emphasized the broader significance of the sentencing, coming amid a national debate over sexual misconduct and abuse prompted by scandals involving powerful men from Hollywood to Washington.\n\nPovilaitis said the conclusion of Nassar's case takes the victims' shame and puts it \"where it belongs, right on him.\"\n\n\"At this particular moment in history, this sentence and hearing will be viewed as a turning point in how our community, our state, our nation, our culture looks at sexual abuse,\" she said.\n\nAquilina rattled off a series of disturbing statistics about the prevalence of sexual abuse before saying, \"It stops now.\"\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe sentencing followed an extraordinary weeklong hearing that saw a parade of Nassar victims tell their stories in raw and unflinching terms, describing how he used medical treatments as a cover to justify penetrating their bodies with his fingers.\n\nAlthough Nassar only admitted to seven instances of abuse in the case, Aquilina allowed other victims to speak at his sentencing. Throughout much of the proceedings, the bespectacled Nassar sat with his head bowed, rarely making eye contact with his victims.\n\nHis accusers ranged from famous Olympic gold medalists like Aly Raisman to women like Denhollander, who was the last of the victims to speak on Wednesday and whom Aquilina described as \"the bravest person I have ever had in my courtroom.\" The accusers had testified Nassar won their trust with kind words and by giving them snacks forbidden by their coaches. Testimony came McKayla Maroney, a gold medalist at the 2012 London Olympics, who called Nassar a \"monster human being\" and a former member of the U.S. national team who said his abuse led to depression and an eating disorder.\n\nAnother gymnast said she was only 6 years old when Nassar began molesting. She blamed Nassar for her father's suicide once the man realized his daughter had not been lying about the abuse she endured.\n\n\"I've been forever changed by all of this and I will never feel small again,\" said Bailey Lorencen, who was an anonymous accuser until she spoke in court this week. \"I have a different confidence in myself as a woman.\"\n\nInstitutions Questioned\n\nIn addition to his work with Olympic teams, Nassar also was the team physician for the Michigan State University gymnastics and women's crew teams, as well as an associate professor at MSU's College of Osteopathic Medicine.\n\nThe National Collegiate Athletic Association said on Tuesday it had opened an investigation into Michigan State's handling of the case. In her statement on Wednesday, Denhollander, criticized the school for failing to adequately investigate complaints against Nassar dating back years.\n\nIn addition to Raisman, Olympic gold medalists Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and McKayla Maroney have gone public in recent months, saying they were assaulted by Nassar while undergoing treatment.\n\nVictims and others have criticized USA Gymnastics, the sport's governing body in the United States, for ignoring their complaints and have accused the federation of suppressing their accounts in a bid to avoid bad publicity.\n\nOn Monday, three top board members resigned in the wake of the scandal, following the exit last March of the federation's president and chief executive.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Kerry Perry, who became USA Gymnastics president in December, applauded the sentence and vowed to \"create a culture that empowers and supports\" the program's athletes.\n\nSeveral companies have announced they would not continue to sponsor the federation, including AT&T Inc on Tuesday.\n\nNassar pleaded guilty in November to seven counts of first-degree sex assault in Ingham County, as well as three additional charges in Eaton County, where he will be sentenced next week.\n\n\u00a9 2018 Thomson Reuters.

Peter Cary Peterson was once featured in a show about wealthy teenagers living in Manhattan. The two have been close friends since they were kids.\n\nLast weekend, they were married in Las Vegas. The event made national headlines because Tiffany Trump was a flower girl. Is this a case of two friends who fell in love and got married out of romantic passion? Not at all.\n\nYahoo reported: \"Tiffany Trump's friends just entered a sexless marriage, which isn't a terrible idea.\" Esme called her marriage \"unconventional\" and explained: \"Peter and I are not romantically involved\u2014in fact we are still dating others and will continue to seek love in all its forms\u2014we are just each other's hearts and wish to begin our journey towards evolution, because the more we face reality, the more we can see that there is no right or wrong.\"\n\nA licensed therapist affirmed their decision: \"We don't need to get married for any of the reasons we used to. Once you've got everything else in place, it is like the cherry on top.\" Another psychologist explained: \"A lot of these sorts of marriages are in response to society getting increasingly isolated, and people want to create a kinship model.\"\n\nBrown's response to her wedding is the mantra of our age: \"We have one life. Free yourself!\"\n\n\"Keep moving forward with God's strength and guidance\"\n\nGod created marriage as a covenant between a man and a woman built on unconditional love (Gen. 2:18-24; Eph. 5:21-33). When he gave the first man and woman to each other, he told them to \"Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth\" (Gen. 1:28). However, our culture's definition of marriage has obviously departed drastically from God's design in recent years.\n\nPrior to Roe v. Wade, unborn children were protected by law; Americans now abort more than 650,000 babies each year. We once valued the sanctity of life until natural death; today, 73 percent of Americans support legalized euthanasia. This percentage has more than doubled since 1951.\n\nThe news is not all negative by any means. As Janet Denison noted in her latest blog, Christians can still influence society in significant ways. The continuing response to Target's dressing-room policy illustrates the power of Christians who coalesce around a moral issue. The popularity of Chick-fil-A and Hobby Lobby show that companies can take strong Christian stands in our culture.\n\nBut as Janet noted, there is also much work to be done, so we must \"keep moving forward with God's strength and guidance.\"\n\nTo that end, consider a biblical event that serves as a parable for cultural engagement today.\n\nA brick in one hand and a sword in the other\n\nadvertisement\n\nNehemiah 4 finds the people of Israel at work rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem. In a day without national armies or police forces, a city's walls were essential to its security. Without such walls, Jerusalem could not be repopulated.\n\nHowever, the project faced enormous opposition from Israel's enemies who understood the strategic significance of this construction project. As a result, half of the people worked on the wall, while half \"handled the spears, shields, bows, and body armor\" (Neh. 4:16b). In addition, \"Those rebuilding the wall and those hauling the loads were working with one hand doing the task, but with the other hand holding the weapon\" (Neh. 4:17).\n\nThis metaphor seems powerful to me: rebuilding the nation with a brick in one hand and a sword in the other. We are to work for the best while preparing for the worst.\n\nIf you're traveling by air and worried about the flu, you should pray for God's protection. But you should also clean common surfaces on the airplane and avoid crowds wherever you can.\n\nIf you're a parent, you should pray for your children to be protected from the devastation of pornography. But you should also use resources such as Covenant Eyes to provide real-time accountability and other support.\n\nIf you're concerned about the moral direction of our culture, you should pray for spiritual awakening each day. But you should also look for ways to impact the lives you touch today.\n\n\"He did what he could\"\n\nOn Wednesday, a drone flew to two distressed swimmers off the coast of Australia and dropped a self-inflating rescue pod into the water, saving their lives. Scientists have now developed a blood test that can detect early signs of eight kinds of cancer. But neither the drone nor the blood test can help people unless they are taken to those who need them.\n\nA brick in one hand and a sword in the other is an image for rebuilding the spiritual walls of our culture. We should be positive and proactive in sharing God's love with our world (Matt. 22:39). But we should also be ready to \"contend for the faith which was once delivered to the saints\" (Jude 3b).\n\nKnow that God has given you all you need to fulfill your kingdom assignment. Your brick is the right size for the wall you are called to build. Your sword is sharp enough for the battle you are called to wage. In Bread for the Journey, Henri Nouwen notes: \"We are good enough to do what we are called to do.\"\n\nDwight Moody said, \"If I could go down to my grave and have it honestly written above it, 'He did what he could,' I would rather have it than a monument of gold reaching to heaven.\" Do you agree?\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Denison Forum.", "domain": "charismanews.com", "label": 0, "url": "https://charismanews.com/opinion/69200-sexless-relationships-the-latest-marital-perversion"}

You've probably heard about him or read about him in my new book, God and Donald Trump. We also have written about him and his incredible story previously online as well as in print.\n\nOf course, against all odds the prophecy came true in 2016\u2014although when he received the revelation, Mark assumed it was meant for 2012.\n\nNow Mark is making new predictions, and they're the subject of today's Strang Report podcast. He repeats some of the prophecies at the end of his book and is sharing others for the first time.\n\nI believe you will find this a fascinating interview that you will want to share. He makes some bold predictions about Supreme Court nominations and also what will happen with some high-profile leaders. Some people will consider these latest prophecies a bit outlandish. Of course, time will tell if Mark is right. As is always the case with prophecy, the body of Christ should test this prophetic word. (Of course in 2011, the thought that Donald Trump would become president was outlandish.)\n\nBy the way, if you haven't already, I encourage you to read his book, The Trump Prophecies\u2014co-authored with my friend, Mary Colbert.

The automobile behind him with baggage tied on top represented the personal baggage people carry around with them.\n\nEd Young, lead pastor of Fellowship Church in Grapevine, Texas, is tackling the problem of personal baggage from dysfunction and abuse in a new sermon series titled \"Adult Children.\"\n\nYoung is covering issues like divorce, addiction, and family dysfunction in the series, which kicked off last week and had its latest installment on Sunday.\n\n\"Divorce. Addiction. Dysfunction. Abuse. We live in a broken world and because of that, we are either experiencing one of these issues or we know someone who is,\" explains Fellowship Church's website.\n\n\"In this series of talks by Ed Young, we will discover what the Bible has to say about these issues, and that ultimately there is value in and victory over our struggles and that hope can arise from heartache.\"\n\nTo illustrate his point, for his first installment of the series, delivered on Jan. 14, Young drove an SUV onto the stage of Fellowship, complete with several bags and suitcases tied to the top.\n\nHe recalled his experiences overseeing a family vacation to SeaWorld when his sons and daughters were children. Upon their return, he forgot about the luggage on top of the car and drove straight into the garage, destroying the top of his garage.\n\nExpand | Collapse (Screenshot: YouTube/Ed Young) Ed Young, Fellowship Church of Grapevine, Texas pastor, delivering the first part of his sermon series \"Adult Children\" on Sunday, January 14, 2018. The automobile behind him included baggage tied on top, representing the personal baggage people carry around with them.\n\n\"A lot of us here have some serious family baggage. We're carrying around a lot of baggage on top of our lives. Yet, most of us are unaware that we have the baggage. We're just sort of used to it,\" explained Young.\n\n\"We think it's 'normal.' We think it's 'healthy.' Yet, if we stop and look, we see the carnage, we see the destruction that the baggage is causing and also we're discovering if we really take a look at our lives that its expensive.\"\n\nWhat kind of baggage are people carrying? Anxiety, anger, lack of forgiveness, promiscuity, trust issues, and guilt, among other things, Young explained. Many people grow up experiencing that baggage in their households and later end up displaying that same anxiety, anger, promiscuity and guilt.\n\n\"Maybe you grew up in the family of a divorce situation, alcohol, drugs, narcissism, maybe you grew up with some sort of abuse,\" he told the congregation. In such families, young girls and boys may end up seeking love and intimacy elsewhere and find themselves having sex with the first person who sends a suggestive text or reaches out to them, Young noted.\n\n\"And then you have confusion in these families where maybe you have an absentee father or mother, you have homosexuality, addiction to porn, lust. I think we see it played out all the time. If you look at how many couples are living together now, I understand it. I get it. 'I'm not going to repeat what I saw in my family. My parents hated each other, they divorced. I'm not going to do that. I'm going to test drive this girl ... this guy [before] we get married.\"\n\nYoung explained that the inspiration for the \"Adult Children\" series was the Bible passage of Isaiah 57:18-19, which reads: \"I have seen how they acted, but I will heal them. I will lead them and help them, and I will comfort those who mourn. I offer peace to all, both near and far! I will heal my people.\"\n\n\"We want children to act like adults and then we have adults acting like children. Why? Well, I'll tell you why. The root of our problem and the fruit of our problem goes all the way back to the origin or our family of origin,\" he said, referring to Adam and Eve.\n\n\"They're the ones who said, 'hey, I want to be God. I want to run the show.' So from there ... we've been dealing and trying to process these issues, these bags.\"\n\nDuring part 2 of the series, delivered on Sunday, Young spoke of the \"will-barrow,\" a play on the word \"wheelbarrow\" which in the sermon referred to an object meant to wheel someone to safety.\n\nYoung spoke about a hypothetical scenario in which a person finds themselves on a tall burning building and then, from a neighboring building, a cable is attached and a person goes over with a wheel-barrow for the rescue.\n\n\"Our great God has sent Jesus to fire the cable from God's side to man's side, He's crossed the cable, we're in a towering inferno. He's locked eyes with you and me, and He looks at us and says 'get in,'\" said Young.\n\n\"Some of us, have gotten in. Some of us have said OK, Jesus, I realize that I am on a towering inferno and I get in. Others of us, though, standing here with our baggage ... we don't comprehend our true condition.\"\n\nYoung attributed this metaphorical refusal to denial, with the hypothetical person replying, \"I can take care of my situation\" and \"I don't really have dysfunction, I don't really have issues.\"\n\nHe added that other factors for rejecting the \"will barrow\" include placing blame on others, being too fearful to get in, or other issues stemming from a dysfunctional upbringing.\n\n\"We use these things and we double down on our dysfunction and when we double down on our dysfunction, it brings us to our knee. Maybe you're down on one knee. Put the other knee down,\" noted Young.\n\n\"These things will bring you to the bottom. Rock bottom. And you might be saying, 'Ed, I'm at rock bottom, man. I'm sitting on the last row, the last seat in the balcony up there and I am at rock bottom.'\"\n\nYoung added that this was \"good,\" because \"if you're at rock bottom, now God can build a foundation and the rock is named Jesus.\"\n\nYouTube/Ed Young", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/ed-young-tackles-family-dysfunction-personal-baggage-in-adult-children-sermon-series-214701/"}

Frightening blood test results from my doctor recently prompted me to ponder this question.\n\nMy triglycerides were at 961. Normal is considered less than 150. My non-HDL cholesterol was also in the \"very high\" range at 229, rather than an \"optimal\" less than 130. Since I want to be alive to meet my grandchildren someday, I decided to begin a mostly plant-based diet.\n\nWhat does the Bible say?\n\nIn Genesis 9, God gives us permission to eat animals. After the flood, when God makes a covenant with Noah, He says, \"The fear and dread of you shall rest on every animal of the earth, and on every bird of the air, on everything that creeps on the ground, and on all the fish of the sea; into your hand they are delivered. Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you; and just as I gave you the green plants, I give you everything.\" (Genesis 9: 2,3)\n\nElsewhere in the Old Testament, God provides instructions to Abraham's descendents for eating meat. Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14 detail the Jewish laws for the types of meat that can and cannot be eaten. Allowed food is called \"clean\" and unallowed food is called \"unclean.\" For land animals, \"whatever parts the hoof and is cloven-footed and chews the cud\" can be eaten. From the waters, animals with fins and scales can be eaten. The chapter lists animals that can't be eaten, including many types of birds, insects and reptiles, but the eating of certain meats are clearly allowed.\n\nIn the New Testament, we find Jesus and the apostles tear down the legalism of the Old Testament. \"He has abolished the law with its commandments and ordinances, that he might create in himself one new humanity in place of the two, thus making peace\" (Ephesians 2:15).\n\nIn Acts 10, Peter falls into a trance and has a vision. He sees Heaven opened and \"all kinds of four-footed creatures and reptiles and birds of the air.\" A voice tells him to \"kill and eat.\" After Peter declines, not wanting to disobey Jewish law, the voice reiterates, \"What God has made clean, you must not call profane.\" The vision sets up a revelation for later in the chapter when Peter realizes the Gospel is for both Jews and Gentiles.\n\nThe Bible, therefore, clearly doesn't forbid the eating of meat. Yet, there is also the question of prudence. Are there good reasons for Christians to avoid eating meat even if it's allowed? An act can be not-sinful yet unwise.\n\nDaniel 1 has an interesting story about a vegan diet. When four Jews are chosen to be part of the king's court in Babylon, they decide to not eat meat or drink wine in order to avoid breaking their dietary laws. The palace guard was concerned the king would have his head if the Jews under his care appeared malnourished. After 10 days of consuming only vegetables and water, however, \"they appeared better and fatter than all the young men who had been eating the royal rations.\" Was it a miracle from God? Did God change the carrot sticks into chicken fingers on the way down? Or was a plant-based diet better for them?\n\nVegetarianism is a wise choice for health reasons, as my own results attest. After four months, my non-HDL cholesterol dropped from 229 to 183 and my triglycerides dropped from 961 to 181. I also lost about 10 pounds.\n\nMany of our health problems, and our high health care costs, in the United States can be attributed to a poor diet. We eat too much fat and don't get enough fiber, mostly due to the amount of meat we consume. (We also consume too much salt and sugar, but a vegetarian diet alone won't help with that.)\n\nThe Center for Disease Control estimates that 75 percent of all health care dollars spent in the United States are to treat preventable diseases \u2014 diseases caused by our poor diet and sedentary lifestyle choices, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer and osteoporosis. We often hear concerns about the rising costs of health care, but we can all do our part by simply eating healthier and getting more exercise.\n\nThere are also ethical concerns about U.S. livestock industries. The overuse of antibiotics by these industries will likely lead to \"superbugs.\" To save money, these industries give antibiotics to all their animals, even the healthy ones. This leads to bacteria becoming resistant to the antibiotics, which then can produce antibiotic resistant germs harmful to humans. Others have raised issues with the environmental damage and the treatment of animals in the livestock industry.\n\nThe large amount of meat and dairy in American diets isn't only due to personal tastes. These industries are a classic example of an iron triangle. Their lobbyists infiltrate government agencies. Members of Congress gain campaign contributions. And the industries benefit from favoritism and taxpayer subsidies. This why you don't hear government agencies advising us to eat less meat, but you do hear them say kids should drink milk daily. So, in a sense, going vegan is a protest against government cronyism. You can be an Ayn-Rand-style hippie by avoiding animal products.\n\nIf more Christians were vegetarian, or ate a lot less animal products, therefore, we could have a positive impact on our overall health, environment, and government.\n\nWhile I'm encouraging my fellow Christians to eat less meat and dairy, I don't insist one must become vegetarian to be a good Christian. As a Focus on the Family blog post on vegetarianism helpfully points out, that would smack of the type of judgmentalism proscribed by the New Testament.\n\n\"Here's the bottom line. If you and your friends feel that God is calling you to stop eating meat, all we can say is 'more power to you.' But we would encourage you to be careful about passing judgment on others who think differently. As you can see, there's a strong case to be made on almost every side of this question. The New Testament tells us again and again that believers must be tolerant towards one another when it comes to matters of this nature. It's crucial to remember that discussions of this kind are secondary to the central issue of saving faith in Jesus Christ. In the words of the apostle Paul, 'Everyone should be fully convinced in his own mind' (Romans 14:5).\"", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/should-christians-be-vegetarians-214290/"}

That's ridiculous.\n\nHere are the three to blame:\n\nChuck Schumer and the Democrats\n\nThe government shutdown was a Democrat-led effort. Senate Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer of New York, were using the filibuster rule, which requires a 60-vote threshold, to prevent passage of a government funding bill.\n\nThe senators to blame for not funding the government were the senators who voted against funding the government. On Friday, that was 42 Democrats, two independents who coalition with the Democrats, and four Republicans. (Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also voted no but for procedural reasons, so he could bring the bill back to the floor for another vote. John McCain wasn't present for the vote for health reasons.) Only five Democrats voted in favor of funding the government on Friday.\n\nI share National Review Editor Rich Lowry's bemusement at media coverage unwilling to point out the obvious. \"It remains amazing that Democrats are attempting a shutdown that is even more audacious than Ted Cruz's \u2014 DACA not even a fiscal matter \u2014 and not getting laughed out of the room by the press,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nDuring the 2013 government shutdown, the media had no difficulty acknowledging that Republicans, led by Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas, were to blame for the shutdown. Cruz wanted to defund Obamacare. In a quixotic attempt to get what he wanted, he led a filibuster of government funding with a minority of Republicans. Since Democrats controlled the Senate, and Obama would never sign a bill defunding his signature achievement, the effort was absurd from the start.\n\nIn the current Democrat shutdown, we also see the minority party, the party not chosen by voters to lead Congress, demanding they get something unrelated to government funding, a DACA bill, in return for funding the government.\n\nI support DACA, a bill to provide legal status to unauthorized immigrants brought to this country as children. But I also support democracy. The notion that the minority party should decide what legislation gets passed, or even voted on, is offensive to majority rule. If Democrats want to be able to pass bills, they should win elections, not use Senate rules to undermine democracy norms.\n\nHow did we get to this point, where the party voters didn't choose to lead the Senate gets to set the agenda?\n\nAaron Burr\n\nThe next person to blame for the government shutdown is Vice President Aaron Burr. Despite the popular myth, the Senate was never designed to be a supermajority institution (except for approving treaties). The filibuster rule came about by accident, not design.\n\nIn 1805, Burr, in his role as president of the Senate, got rid of the \"previous question\" motion, or the rule that allowed the Senate to end debate on a bill. This was done by mistake. It was not done to allow filibusters. It would be many years later, 1837, before a senator would use Burr's mistake to impose the will of a minority on the majority.\n\nIt wasn't until 1917 that the Senate was able to add a rule to end debate (called Rule 22 or the cloture rule). But Rule 22 required a two-thirds vote to end debate, which was changed again to a three-fifths vote in 1974.\n\nThroughout the early 20th Century, filibusters were often used to kill civil rights bills. Legislation supported by a majority of the country, such as an anti-lynching law, was prevented by the filibusters of Southern Democrats.\n\nSince the filibuster is counter to the democratic norm of majority rule, why do Americans support it?\n\nJefferson Smith\n\nThe last person to blame for the government shutdown is Jefferson Smith, the fictional lead character played by Jimmy Stewart in Frank Capra's \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" (1939), perhaps the worst political film in the history of Hollywood.\n\nIn the film, Jefferson Smith is appointed to a Senate seat. When a majority of senators attempt to pass legislation Smith doesn't like, he filibusters to prevent passage of the bill.\n\nSmith wasn't even chosen by voters. He was appointed by the governor to temporarily fill the seat until the next election. Yet, in the dramatic climax of the film, he uses the filibuster to impose his will on the duly elected majority. You would think that a happy ending would see Smith's deviant schemes fail, but Capra presents Smith's villainy as heroic.\n\nAmericans should demand that the Senate get rid of the filibuster and return to the sanity of majority rule. That wouldn't end all government shutdowns, but it would end this one, and make them less likely in the future. Instead, most Americans actually like the filibuster. I blame Jefferson Smith.\n\nNow it's true that the Democrats' ultimate goal, the passage of DACA, is admirable, and the fictional legislation that Smith successfully killed was bad, a sort of government cronyism bill, but the ends shouldn't justify the means. Process matters. We should support good legislation, but only when done the right way.\n\nDemocracies will sometimes make bad choices. That's a bargain we must accept to live in a democracy. By supporting non-majoritarian means to pass good legislation, we undermine democracy, and that will have far worse consequences in the long term.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/who-was-to-blame-for-the-government-shutdown-this-time-214687/"}

She also told Reuters in an interview she wants to tighten immigration rules.\n\nHuhtasaari, who has been dubbed Finland\u2019s Marine Le Pen after France\u2019s National Front leader, is a long-shot. But she believes she has a real chance in the January election as her party has taken a fresh start and picked up impetus following its removal from the coalition government in June.\n\nShe says, \u201cThe rise in Europe of parties that are critical towards the EU and immigration is due to bad, unjust politics. The role for Finland in the eurozone is the role of a loser and payer. I do not want Finland to become a province of EU; Finns must stand up for Finland\u2019s interests.\u201d\n\nThe last time Finland was invaded was by the Red, not the Black armies. On November 30, 1939, Stalin\u2019s Red Army, numbering 1,000,000 men under arms, engulfed the sparsely populated Scandinavian nation. The Russians lost 30 tanks in the first month alone.\n\nFor every Finn serviceman who lost his life, eight Russians lost their lives. By March 12, 1940, British media\u2019s favourite army was routed and their Uncle Joe was humiliated. Perhaps Laura Huhtasaari can repeat the success of her forefathers.\n\nShe is not likely to win the election which begins at the end of this month, but it\u2019s good to know that there are such up and comers in Finland. As one of the most vocal opponents of immigration in her party, she has demanded that asylum seekers be denied entry in Finland \u201cby all means necessary\u201d, said the fear that Islam inspires can be explained by \u201cMuslim backwardness.\u201d\n\nVlad Tepesblog", "domain": "barenakedislam.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://barenakedislam.com/2018/01/21/will-western-europe-continue-to-veer-right/"}

So while many people might find the backlash [against Chip and Jo Gaines] unwarranted, it's actually a conversation we need to have in order to challenge our uncritical acceptance of the life-fulfillment-through-procreation story.\"\n\nAnd even though population control is fraught with associations with \"nasty historical events\" and \"eugenics,\" it merits further discussion because it is \"not an exaggeration to say that the survival of our species depends on it,\" she went on to say.\n\nAmid dire looming threats to the planet scientists like Steven Hawking warn are imminent, \"the fact that people are starting to react to those who have many children is great, but we need to go much further,\" Pyszczyk asserted.\n\n\"Women need to be presented with options for a fulfilling life that don't involve taking 20 years of their lives to care for offspring,\" she said, adding that more people should consider adopting kids.\n\n\"I get that humankind's theoretical demise is not enough to justify abstaining from what is for many the most meaningful experience of a lifetime. But it's not theoretical. Climate change is getting measurably worse, populations are multiplying exponentially and economic inequality is not getting better. And to top it off, Prince is dead. Don't bring a child into this.\"\n\nThe population control narrative that children are a tax on the earth continues to reappear on the political landscape despite evidence showing its futility.\n\nAn omniscient God would not have created a planet insufficient for our human needs as the number of people increased, said Steven Mosher, president of the Population Research Institute, in a March 2017 interview with The Christian Post. And He would \"pre-deploy the resources that we would then unlock with our creative intelligence, another gift from God.\"\n\nAnd aside from anything theological, the PRI president added, the history of the human race has demonstrated this to be the case.\n\n\"As our numbers have grown, our well-being has grown even faster because we collectively invent solutions for the problems caused by our numbers, which leave us better off at the end of the day than when we started,\" Mosher said.\n\nWhen wealthy European nations go into poor countries and essentially tell them that \"a life lived at less than $10,000 per capita is not worth living, and so, therefore, you shouldn't have children because you can't give them each their own separate bedroom and promise to pay private school tuition,\" it is a pitiful measure of the value of life, he said.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/chip-and-joanna-gaines-having-too-many-kids-feminist-says-population-control-worth-revisiting-213992/"}

Marriott in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 19, 2018.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A Christian father, who along with his wife and three children, moved to Africa in 2013 after the U.S. government refused to let them bring home their newly adopted daughter from Uganda, spoke Friday what it means to act on God's convictions despite not knowing exactly what The Lord is calling for.\n\nJonathan \"Smooth\" Via, a pastor and missionary affiliated with the humanitarian organization Arise Africa, gave his family's testimony while speaking at the 2018 Evangelicals for Life conference at the J.W. Marriott, hosted by the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission ahead of the March for Life in the nation's capital.\n\nVia, who proposed to his wife, Kelly, on the banks of the Nile River in 2001, has for many years had a passion for the people of Uganda and has served on many Arise Africa short-term missions there.\n\nAlthough the Vias had made several mission trips to the developing country in the past, Via explained that it wasn't until they went there again for a short-term mission in 2010 that their lives would change forever.\n\nIt was that year when Arise Africa had just opened what Via referred to as a \"babies home\" in response to requests from local pastors who were looking for ways to help orphaned and at-risk children. Naturally, the Vias decided to visit the home.\n\n\"It was while we were [at the babies' home] that something changed in me. I don't have the words to put to it. But, it was like God was tearing open a hole in my heart, like he was making room for somebody who he was about to bring into our lives,\" Via told the audience. \"It was when we got back to the room that night that my wife and I began to talk about it and she felt the same way.\"\n\nVia said that it felt like God had \"drastically altered\" their entire future.\n\n\"I told [my wife] ... 'We don't get to go back and pretend like it's business as usual anymore,'\" Via recalled. \"It was several months later that we finally turned in an application with an adoption agency with the express purpose of adopting a child from Arise Africa's babies' home.\"\n\nVia explained that there were some initial setbacks that are common with adoptions from countries like Uganda. Once everything got approved through the Uganda court system for them to adopt from the babies' home, the Vias were finally able to travel to meet their new adopted daughter, Chloe, in April 2012.\n\n(Photo: The Archibald Project) The Via family unites with their adopted daughter and sister, Chloe, for the first time in this photo from April 2012.\n\nThe Vias believed it would only be a matter of weeks before they would be able to return home to the U.S. with their new adopted daughter.\n\nHowever, God had \"something completely different in mind,\" Via explained.\n\n\"It was immediately after that date that it began to feel like everything was falling apart,\" Via emotionally said.\n\nAlthough the Vias made it through the Uganda court system and were named her legal guardians in May 2012, the situation took a turn for the worst after the Vias applied for a visa for Chloe through the U.S. Embassy.\n\n\"For reasons unbeknownst to us, we don't know entirely what happened, but I do know for sure that the consular who was adjudicating our case for some reason became convinced that something unethical or something sketchy had happened in the process of our adoption,\" Via said. \"She set out from that point forward to sabotage our adoption.\"\n\n\"It is a bold claim, I realize, but we actually caught her on several blatant lies and misrepresentations of our case,\" Via continued.\n\nAccording to Via, he had worked previously with Arise Africa for over 10 years. He assured that the organization had never done anything unethical.\n\nVia said that because he and his wife didn't want to \"steal a child\" or do anything unethical, Kelly Via tracked down Chloe's birth mother and met with her face-to-face and asked her several hard questions with the help of a translator.\n\nOne of the questions, Via recalled, was, \"What was going through your mind when you released Chloe to the babies' home?\"\n\n\"We even asked, 'What if we don't adopt her?'\" Via remembered. '\"What if we adopted you as a family and we sponsored you as a family? Would that make a difference so maybe you would have the finances to be able to care for her and give her and education? Would that change anything for you?'\"\n\nAccording to Via, the mother told his wife that when she gave her daughter up to the babies' home, she no longer considered Chloe to be her daughter.\n\n\"Nevertheless, the consolar at the embassy gathered her information and sent it off to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services with the cards clearly stacked against us,\" Via said.\n\nIn October 2012, the Via's got a letter from USCIS saying that they were going to deny Chloe's visa application. Between the May approval in the Ugandan court system and the October letter from USCIS, Via said, was a hard time for the family, as they spent much of it split between two continents.\n\nAfter receiving the letter of denial, Via said he didn't know what else to do.\n\n\"I read that letter and I almost collapsed on my bathroom floor. I laid there on my back and I was so angry. I said, 'God, I don't get it. I don't understand what you are doing? You are the one who started this whole process. You put this on our heart, we are just trying to do what You called us to do. Why does it feel like your hand is actively involved in making this process difficult?' I laid there and there was no answer,\" Via said.\n\n\"I laid there and said, 'Fine. What am I supposed to do because I am so lost right now? I don't know what to do. I don't know where to go. I don't know what decision to make. I don't know. What am I supposed to do?'\" Via asked. \"He answered me with three very simple words, 'fight for her.' He said fight for her because I fought for you and what you don't understand is that I am telling a bigger story here. I am telling something so much bigger than just your adoption.'\"\n\nVia said that he walked out of the bathroom with a \"new level of clarity.\" He clarified that it wasn't really a \"direction\" that God had provided because at that point he still wasn't sure what fighting for his daughter meant as far as actions he needed to take.\n\n\"I knew one thing for sure \u2014 that there would never be at time when I would stop fighting for my daughter,\" Via said.\n\nWhen the Vias received a final notice of denial from the USCIS on Dec. 31, 2012, it became clear what the family needed to do.\n\n\"With our new level of clarity, we said, 'What does this look like?

And the answer is yes.\"\n\nIn a statement, the Gladstone Institute noted that they were building upon the findings of senior investigator Shinya Yamanaka, MD, PhD, who in 2006 found that \"he could make stem cells \u2014 dubbed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) \u2014 by treating ordinary skin cells with four key proteins.\"\n\n\"Ding and others previously created iPSCs not with transcription factors, but by adding a cocktail of chemicals to the cells,\" noted the institute.\n\n\"The latest study, published in Cell Stem Cell, offers a third way to turn skin cells into stem cells by directly manipulating the cells' genome using CRISPR gene regulation techniques.\"\n\nShort for \"clusters of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats,\" CRISPRs are a type of DNA sequences found in bacteria.\n\n\"CRISPR technology was adapted from the natural defense mechanisms of bacteria and archaea (the domain of single-celled microorganisms).

Larry Ross Communications) Joni Eareckson Tada is a radio host and the founder of the Joni and Friends International Disability Center.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Renowned evangelical author and disabilities advocate Joni Eareckson Tada is warning that the United States could one day become like Canada or more liberal European nations that promote physician-assisted suicide unless Christians push back against the trend.\n\nEareckson Tada, a 68-year-old quadriplegic and best-selling author, spoke with The Christian Post last week before giving a keynote address at the annual Evangelicals for Life conference in the nation's capital in which she addressed the topic of \"dignity in disability.\"\n\nTada, the founder of the Joni and Friends International Disability Center who was paralyzed in a diving accident when she was 17, stressed that the way a strong majority of the American public and many evangelicals are quickly embracing physician-assisted suicide as a \"morally acceptable\" option when patients face terminal illnesses, she could easily see the U.S. going the way of more socially progressive nations within the next 10-plus years.\n\n\"Thirty-eight percent of evangelicals feel that it's morally permissible for physicians to help when requested for aid in dying,\" Tada said, referring to a 2016 LifeWay Research poll. \"That shows me that No. 1, we don't have a biblical worldview on suffering and we don't know how to deal with it. We want to drug it, escape it, euthanize it, do anything but live with it. No. 2, we fear it.\"\n\n\"What we have done in our country is we have allowed fundamental fears to be the framework for what we think is rational, social policy,\" she continued. \"That reflects a culture of contradictions.\"\n\nTada specifically voiced concern about the assisted suicide law in the state of Oregon, known as the Death With Dignity Act. The act permits physician-assisted suicide for people with illnesses and conditions that could lead to death within six months.\n\nAlthough the law has been on the books since 1997, it was recently reported that the law was written so loosely that it could technically permit people with treatable deadly illnesses such as diabetes to refuse treatment and be eligible for physician-assisted suicide so long as they find two doctors to sign off on their request.\n\n\"It is any disease, which left untreated, could result in death within six months. Of course, that would happen if you had diabetes and you go into renal failure,\" Tada explained. \"People with muscular dystrophy, people with Lou Gehrig's disease, people in certain stages of multiple sclerosis might qualify. People with musculoskeletal diseases that, if they become despairing with their condition and decide they don't want treatment, might qualify.\"\n\nWith the way that the Oregon law is written, Tada said, all it would take is \"just one court challenge\" for a judge to widen the definition to include \"someone not only with diabetes, but also with MS, MD or ALS.\"\n\nAlthough physician-assisted suicide in the U.S. is illegal in 44 states and legal in just six states and the District of Columbia, Tada has warned that the U.S. has been on a slippery slope since the Supreme Court ruled in 1973 to legalize abortion across the nation.\n\n\"When the Supreme Court judges determined that the U.S. Constitution has within it an inherent right to privacy, that is the birth of an entitlement society that doesn't necessarily want to ascribe positive virtue to any suffering but would rather use personal choice to not take that route,\" Tada told CP. \"Some don't want their death to be a painful and difficult death. Yes, it is understandable. But instead of channeling resources into legislation giving people a right to die, let's channel resources into better pain management, developing better pain therapies, bringing people out of social isolation, ascribing positive virtue to chronic conditions.\"\n\n\"These are acts of compassion, not five patches of fentanyl on your chest and three grams of barbital,\" she added. \"That is an act of isolation, not compassion.\"\n\nTada warned that it's not too far fetched to one day see state laws start to take the shape of more socially liberal nations.\n\n(Photo: Courtesy Joni Eareckson Tada) Joni Eareckson Tada under a parachute at Murrieta Hot Springs\n\n\"In Belgium, you can be 12 years old and the court will listen to your plea if you find your suffering unbearable and your parents can't intervene. That is insane,\" Tada warned. \"What court would think that a child would have the psychological wherewithal to understand the difference between life and death?\"\n\nIn the Netherlands, euthanasia has become so common that it accounts for about 4.5 percent of the nation's deaths. In 2016, it was reported that man in the Netherlands was euthanized over his alcohol addiction.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a mother was granted the right by the nation's high court in 2014 to euthanize her 12-year-old daughter who as suffering from a host of non-life-threatening injuries.\n\nIn 2016, the Canadian government passed a law allowing people who are \"incurably ill\" to seek physician-assisted suicide.\n\n\"If Christians don't [push back], then I see for sure us going the way of certainly Canada or England, hopefully not Belgium or Switzerland, where you can euthanize just if you are depressed,\" Tada said.\n\nTada stressed that preventing the slide down the slippery slope means Christians must do more than simply speaking out against right-to-die legislation, but also taking time out of their lives to help the family down the street who has a severely disabled child or helping a disabled person who has been so isolated from the world because of illness or injury feel connected to society again.\n\n\"To be pro-life for a long time just meant that you have to be against abortion. It's more than that. It means adoption, it means support services, crisis pregnancy centers, and the same is true for disability,\" Tada said. \"To be pro-life means that we don't want someone with diabetes to take advantage of Oregon's Death with Dignity Act. Well that means someone needs to get involved with his life and provide social support.\"\n\n\"There is so much talk about mainstream and inclusion in churches. People with disabilities want to belong to a body of Christ,\" she continued. \"We want to know that when we don't show up next Sunday for services that somebody is going to miss me. We want to be a friend. We want to have friendships and relationships. We have to get rid of the mechanistic, abstract, dry, theoretical approach to people's needs and really practice Christianity with its sleeves rolled up. We just got to be involved in people's lives.\"\n\nTada recalled her own experiences and said that when she first suffered her diving accident over 50 years ago, she was in such despair and had lost hope. She explained that she even begged her friends to bring in their mom's sleeping pills or their dad's razors.\n\n\"What changed my life were Christian friends who not only gave me the Word but gave me their time and their love and gave me a chance to go to a movie with them,\" Tada said. \"They just befriended me. We need to practice Christianity with its sleeves rolled up.\"\n\nTada has revised her 1992 book When Is It Right To Die? that touches on how Christians should react to the trending developments of the assisted suicide movement over the last 25 years. The updated version of her book will be released later this month.\n\n\"It's a trend, but it's only a trend as far as Christians are willing to be vocal and speak out about this,\" Tada said. \"That's why I wrote, When Is It Right To Die? I wanted to give people, not only the understanding of the arguments against physician-assisted suicide, I wanted to give them a sense of what the Bible has to say and to give them language so that they can voice their opinions during coffee at Starbucks or during the local PTA meeting or with co-workers in carpool.\"", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/joni-eareckson-tada-if-christians-dont-act-us-assisted-suicide-laws-become-like-uk-canada-samuel-smith-215004/"}

The salt concentration in the wells of Gaza is as high as 2,000 milligrams of chloride per liter, compared to the common standard of 250 milligrams of chloride per liter.\n\n\u201cThe annual amount that can be pumped without harming the aquifer\u2019s regeneration capacity is 60 million cubic meters,\u201d Jacoby told Haaretz, noting that \u201cin practice, due to population growth and a lack of precipitation, the residents of the Gaza Strip draw 200 million cubic meters from the reservoir.\u201d\n\nHalf of this quantity is drawn for domestic use, and the other half includes water from 5,000 private wells in the Gaza Strip.\n\nJacoby noted that over-pumping caused a sharp drop in the aquifer\u2019s level, which allowed salt water to penetrate from the sea and raise the salt level of the groundwater. The salt concentration in the wells of Gaza is as high as 2,000 milligrams of chloride per liter, compared to the common standard of 250 milligrams of chloride per liter.\n\nAs a result, close to 90% of the water does not meet the WHO\u2019s salinity standard.\n\nIn addition to the saline process, the Gaza Strip groundwater is polluted by a large quantity of sewage. About 70% of Gaza\u2019s homes are connected to sewage collection networks, but because of poor maintenance a large part of the sewage seeps into the groundwater, which is why the concentration of nitrates (nitrogen compounds that are an indicator of pollution) has increased.\n\n\u201cBecause of the electricity shortage, we are not able to fully operate the wells, and sometimes they only work a few hours a day,\u201d Yaakobi explained. \u201cThe electricity shortage also prevents the operation of the five sewage treatment plants in the Gaza Strip, and the effluents flow without purification to the sea.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sewage reaches the beaches of Ashkelon and Ashdod, but first it pollutes our own beaches,\u201d Yaakobi said, noting that \u201cofficially, it is forbidden to bathe in the sea of Gaza, which is the only resort for the residents. Of course, there are people who do it anyway,\u201d he added.\n\nThere exists a long-term plan of the Palestinian Authority to erect a large-capacity desalination plant in the Gaza Strip, which would provide 135 million cubic meters of water a year. So far, the PA has managed to collect half the needed budget, from international charities. But even after the plant is finally built, without enough electricity it won\u2019t work \u2013 same for the new sewage purification plants which are being built.\n\nAnd, naturally, with the current staggering unemployment level in Gaza, there won\u2019t be enough paying customers to buy the electricity, the sewage purification and the desalinated water.", "domain": "barenakedislam.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://barenakedislam.com/2018/01/22/gaza-gee-if-only-hamas-would-stop-spending-all-its-money-on-building-terror-tunnels-and-launching-rockets-into-israel-perhaps-they-could-treat-their-sewage-and-produce-clean-drinking-water/"}

Don\u2019t forget, the job of the chief of staff is to control who their boss sees, what their boss sees, and how their boss goes about doing things.\n\nIn other words, there\u2019s no possible way that Rybicki didn\u2019t know about the corrupt dealings going on within the FBI, especially the botched (read: intentionally mishandled) investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s illegal private server. With the Inspector General\u2019s report due to come out any time now, it appears as if Rybicki is pulling a McCabe and jumping ship before his benefits are stripped from him.\n\nTEXT SOURCE", "domain": "beforeitsnews.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://beforeitsnews.com/politics/2018/01/breaking-comeys-inside-man-at-the-fbi-just-busted-hes-done-2975765.html"}

As possibly one of those most prime examples of this fact, the incidents that took place on September 11, 2001, seems to stand out above the rest.\n\nThere have been many different accusations brought to the table by concerned citizens, architects, government officials and whistleblowers, and even ongoing studies that prove something about the collapse of the world trade centers that day wasn\u2019t right. It goes back and forth and has for many years now, but one thing isn\u2019t changing: The media isn\u2019t forgetting about this one, because we\u2019re not letting it slide. Scientists, researchers, and people all around the world have contributed to making these conspiracy theories, conspiracy facts. What happened on 9/11 isn\u2019t at all what we were told, and something much larger has been hidden from us.\n\nYou might think that only conspiracy nuts and tin foil headed weirdos are the only people who could believe that this national crisis was designed and executed to cover something up, but you\u2019d be entirely wrong. More than 165 million Americans question the authenticity of what really happened that day, and even believe the US government is hiding something from the people. That\u2019s 54.3% of the American population. Studies have been conducted, documents have been uncovered, and physics blatantly doesn\u2019t add up \u2013 yet all we hear is silence from the US government.\n\nWithout further ado, there have been studies among studies to bring these theories to light and actually prove that they are indeed facts. These 17 facts about what really happened that day are truthful, evidence-based, and crucial to your free will. See them below.\n\n1. It was a controlled demolition\n\nA study performed by Professor Lynn Margulis from the Department of Geosciences has led her to believe that all three of the buildings were destroyed by carefully planned, orchestrated, and executed controlled demolition plans.\n\n2. FireFighters Heard Bombs\n\nSome firefighters on the day of the attack even report hearing multiple bomb noises. Two firefighters even discussed the definite secondary explosions that occurred after the plane had already hit.\n\n3. World Leaders Say Inside Job\n\nEven other world leaders have said they believe this was an inside job. Vladimir Putin even said that a number of times so-called terrorists are not being organized by who we think they are and he calls out the imaginary threats being used to control us.\n\n4. Alcoholism in New York Went Up\n\nAfter the attacks, studies show that in the following weeks alcoholism went up by approximately 25%. Even tobacco use was increased by 10%, marijuana use 3.2%, and church attendance by 20%.\n\n5. Children With Lost Parents Increased\n\nAnother sad statistic conducted in the following weeks of the attack showed that the number of children who lost a parent in the attack was approximately 3,051 children.\n\n6. $100 Million Dollars of Art Were Lost\n\nOf course absolutely incomparable to the number of lives lost, there were approximately one hundred million dollars worth of art lost in the collapse of the twin towers.\n\n7. People Saw A Missile\n\nMajor General Albert Stubblebine is an insider that has bravely spoken out about 9/11. He emphasizes that he never saw a plane hit the Pentagon like mainstream media reported.He further explains how the smoke and puffs of ash mirror that of a controlled demolition.\n\n8. It Created Islamophobia\n\nMany people believe it was constructed to install an era if Islamophobia. You cannot deny that after the attacks there was a rapid increase in racial tension and fear of Islamic people.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, there is no Islamic army or terrorist group called Al-Qaeda, and any informed intelligence officer knows this. But, there is a propaganda campaign to make the public believe in the presence of an intensified entity representing the \u2018devil\u2019 only in order to drive TV watchers to accept a unified international leadership for a war against terrorism. The country behind this propaganda is the United States.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Robin Cook, former British Foreign Secretary\n\n9. Building 7\n\nMany people often forget about building number seven. Building number seven, according to the official explanation, came down as a result of structural instability and fires. WTC 7 fell on 9/11 and was not even struck by any places.\n\n10. It Created Awareness\n\nThe attack helped raise global awareness of governments within governments, secret organizations, and hidden agendas within US and other world government administrations.\n\n11. We Lost Rights As A Result\n\nBy using the terrorist threat, the US government has excused invading foreign lands and stripping away the rights of Americans right here in the heartland. One NSA whistleblower, Thomas Drake told Vice News:\n\nIn the years after 9/11, Thomas Drake, then a National Security Agency (NSA) executive, saw something he couldn\u2019t abide: an NSA-led program named Stellarwind. The dragnet-surveillance operation was spying on American citizens using a combination of wiretapping and mass-data collection through the internet.\n\nDrake protested internally, feeling that Stellarwind violated the Fourth Amendment and was highly illegal\u2014a warrantless surveillance of citizens on home soil. But Michael Hayden, then the head of the NSA who presided over the program, believed American spies had to do whatever it took to prevent another such tragedy.\n\nAccording to Drake, when the September 11 attacks happened\u201415 years ago\u2014the military-and-intelligence-industrial complex became so obsessed with hunting terrorists that the rights of American citizens were trumped. He complained through every legal channel and whistleblower-protection law to no avail. So in the winter of 2006, he contacted a reporter at the Baltimore Sun and helped her expose some of the NSA abuses he loathed.\n\nFor his actions, the FBI raided Drake\u2019s home, and he was charged under the Espionage Act of 1917, narrowly avoiding 35 years in jail.\n\n12. The Global Elite Likely Designed It All\n\nBecause of political, power, and financial gains it is likely that the entire disaster was planned and executed by the global elite. They control what we are told, what\u2019s the truth, and our literally inalienable rights as a human being.\n\n13. It Birthed Alternative Media\n\nAlternative media was directly derived from this disaster and the holes of truth poked in the story we were told. Through that we realized that mainstream media was controlled, organized, and untruthful. Because of this we got Wikileaks and major news networks that actually report the truth.\n\n14. It Shifted Consciousness\n\nThe attack helped shift the consciousness of the entire world. There was a moment of silence throughout the globe that resonated empathy for thousands of people. It brought families and friends closer together and made us all appreciate life a little more than we did before.\n\n15. It Manifests Different Forms\n\nThe steel and debris left behind from the collapse of the towers has now been recreated in many beautifully artistic memorial monuments for ground zero.\n\n16. The Owner of The Property Rebuilds\n\nProperty developer Larry Silverstein purchased his 99-year lease just before the collapse of the towers for $3.2 Billion. He is still to this day rebuilding a commercial office and shopping complex alongside ground zero \u2013 complete with an entire museum.\n\n17. Hijackers Stayed Nearby Before The Attack\n\nFive of the 9/11 hijackers stayed in a motel right outside the gates of the American spy organization, the National Security Agency, in the days immediately before the attacks.\n\nFeatured image via Humans Are Free", "domain": "awarenessact.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://awarenessact.com/17-conspiracy-theories-surrounding-911-that-are-actually-conspiracy-facts/"}

Pearl Brown suffers from a rare disorder called Alobar holoprosencephaly.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A Tennessee dad opened up about the joy and struggles his family has faced five years after he and his wife chose to carry their precious daughter to term, though they were advised by doctors to induce labor at 20 weeks of pregnancy and \"try again\" because of a rare, debilitating brain disorder.\n\nEric Brown, a photographer and a father of three children, gave his family's testimony Thursday before a large crowd gathered for the third annual Evangelicals for Life conference, hosted by the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission.\n\nBrown, of Nashville, emotionally recounted the decision that faced him and his wife, Ruth, when they were informed at their 20-week ultrasound that their unborn youngest daughter, Pearl, is suffering from a disorder that doctors deemed \"not compatible with life.\"\n\n\"After a pregnancy that was wrought with heartache and hope, she was diagnosed with a condition known as Alobar holoprosencephaly during our 20-week ultrasound,\" Brown recalled, referring to a disorder that caused premature stalling of brain development and Pearl to be born with a cleft upper lip and inverted nose.\n\n\"We were advised on that day to induce labor, say goodbye and try again,\" he remembered.\n\nBrown explained that the last thing he and Ruth wanted to to do was to take away the life-giving haven that the mother was giving their daughter before she was ready to survive outside the womb. However, Brown explained that it was a \"belittling\" experience to try and convince the doctor that they wanted to carry Pearl to term.\n\n\"We knew very well what would happen if we did [what the doctor suggested], that there was no way that Pearl's body had developed enough to survive outside of Ruth's womb,\" Brown said. \"She was being sustained in there and God was still knitting her together. It seemed too cruel to us to take away the very system that was helping her broken body do what it was incapable of doing on its own.\"\n\nPearl Joy Brown was born alive on July 27, 2012. Brown assured the audience that God has a reason for why Pearl was born with an inverted nose, lack of vision and hearing and an inability to move any part of her body \"on purpose.\"\n\n(Screenshot: ERLC) Ruth Brown lies down with her daughter, Pearl, who suffers from a rare disorder called Alobar holoprosencephaly.\n\n\"As rattling as those initial appointments were, we were confident that God was executing a plan for Pearl that He had written before the foundation of the world,\" Brown said. \"I had spent previous years doing reading on suffering and disability and God's goodness and sovereignty over such situations. We were aware on the deepest possible level that this was His doing, that He was working and that the primary reason to carry Pearl to term was not for her sake but because we ought to not interrupt the master Creator while He is at work.\"\n\n\"He lovingly gave her a tiny, hollow, single-hemisphere of a brain at the tip of her brainstem. He was calling all of us to trust Him. Though He didn't necessarily call Pear's disability 'good,' He was certainly working all of it together for our good and His glory.\"\n\nAccording to Brown, the doctors were not confident that Pearl would survive, stating that doctors expected Pearl to die before she was born and again during the delivery and again in the early moments of her life.\n\nBut five years later, Pearl still lives even though the Browns are seemingly less optimistic about her health and have made very large sacrifices in their lives to care for their daughter, who will never be able to care for herself.\n\n\"I pleaded with God to give us that difficult life but not to go so far as to take Pearl's life. I wanted so badly the privilege of pushing her around in a wheelchair with an oxygen tank strapped to the side but I had no idea what I was asking. Often, when I look back on the desperation of those prayers, I am so thankful that I had no idea. Perhaps, if I had known how hard it would be without truly grasping how wonderfully rich life is, that I wouldn't have pleaded Pearl's case as vigorously as I did.\"\n\nWith Pearl in their lives, the Browns' lives had drastically changed. However, they are not alone. Brown praised his church community and friends for rallying around his family in their time of need.\n\n\"I could tell you how our pastor's wife joined us for so many of those extended ultrasounds or how friends paid our bills so that I could quit a job that required travel. I could tell you how for months, our church cooked our meals for us or sometimes they just came in and cried in our living room while sharing how God was changing them through Pearl,\" Brown explained. \"I could even tell you how friends even held a benefit concert before she was born and how they bought us a minivan after she came home alive because our tiny sedan couldn't hold all the medical equipment.\"\n\n\"Everytime that [we] sat down for a dinner together, we were keenly aware that Pearl was also sitting down for the same meal,\" he added.\n\nAlthough Pearl has survived outside the womb for this long, Brown said that his daughter's health seems to be taking a turn for the worse because of new complications.\n\n\"They are different [complications] and we suspect, as do the doctors, that her body is growing weary. She doesn't seem to be standing in line for a miraculous turnaround,\" Brown said as he fought back tears. \"And though her best day will likely be our worst, this seems to be the next chapter for our family. Pearl can't hustle or chase her dreams. She isn't having her best life now. ... She has not been healed as we pleaded for during her first year.\"\n\nRest assured, Brown asserted that \"God is with Pearl and has not left her to her own devices.\"\n\n\"The promises that He made to her will, in large part, not be fulfilled until after her final breath. He cares for her, as she bears His image,\" Brown asserted. \"She, like all of us, is completely helpless otherwise. So if the theology that you are teaching, or the banner that you are waving, can't honestly be preached to Pearl in her current state, then it is probably not true. At the very least, perhaps you should hold it loosely.\"\n\n\"It's true that Pearl takes a disproportionate amount of resources from most everyone in her life,\" he added. \"The great news, however, is that no matter that resource, we are all drawing from the King's coffers.\"\n\nThe Browns' dedication and love for their daughter earned the praise of prominent disability rights activist and evangelical author Joni Eareckson Tada, who has suffered from quadriplegia for over 50 years after a diving accident.\n\n\"Eric chose a very noble and courageous route,\" Eareckson Tada told The Christian Post during the conference. \"There are many parents who would not do that.\"\n\nWatch Brown's testimony here.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/dad-shares-how-daughter-with-tiny-brain-inverted-nose-still-lives-5-years-after-being-told-to-abort-214298/"}

In the wake of Sept. 11th, twelve brave U.S. soldiers dropped everything and ventured into an unknown land, outnumbered 5,000 to 1 to complete one of the most successful special forces missions of all time. Once there, the soldiers develop an uneasy partnership with the Northern Alliance to take down the Taliban and its al-Qaida allies. Outgunned and outnumbered, they had to use the rudimentary tactics of the Afghan horse soldiers rather than state-of-the-art warfare to battle the heavily-armed Taliban. This is the amazing story of these 12 heroes and the families who wondered if they would come home alive,\" a description of the film explains.\n\nUnlike \"The Avengers,\" this film tells the story of real-life heroes. It features \"Thor\" himself, Hemsworth, as the heroic Captain Mitch Nelson and co-stars Michael Pe\u00f1a (\"Crash,\" \"World Trade Center\"), Michael Shannon (\"Revolutionary Road\"), Geoff Stults (\"Enlisted\"), William Fichtner (\"Black Hawk Down\"), Trevante Rhodes (\"Moonlight\") and Rob Riggle (\"Hangover').\n\nWhen asked about the role of a hero and why it's important for people to step up to the challenge in this day and age despite the challenges, Hemsworth said he thinks people need to be born with that leader quality.\n\nExpand | Collapse (Photo: Warner Brothers) \"12 Strong\" Hit's theaters January 19, 2018.\n\n\"It's certainly an added weight and responsibility, telling this story, portraying these guys, having them on set with us giving us advice and so on. We had a wealth of knowledge at our fingertips. There is a sort of unwavering certainty with these guys, and a belief that this is what they were put on this earth to do,\" Hemsworth told The Christian Post.\n\n\"I think you're either born with that or not in this sense. You can find confidence and belief and so on but what was so impressive about these guys is that there was no massive ego or anything, this was their job,\" he shared.\n\nActor Pe\u00f1a played the supporting role of Sgt. First Class Sam Diller, one of the 12 soldiers in Captain Nelson's crew. The popular Mexican-American actor spoke on the importance of family and how vital of a role that played in helping these soldiers make it back home.\n\n\"That's the reason that these guys go out and fight ... they are guarding America and its freedom. One of those freedoms, which not every country does have, is the freedom of family \u2014 to take care of their family and be with their family. They want to come back to their family and come back alive,\" Pe\u00f1a stated.\n\n\"12 Strong\" has an underlying theme of faith and shows the power of unity and determination. Hemsworth recently put his Christian belief on display at Disneyland in December 2017. The 34-year-old actor was featured in a Christmas ceremony that featured a candlelit choir singing Christian carols as he read the story of Christ's birth found in the gospel of Luke.\n\nWhen asked to discuss the importance of faith in relation to \"12 Strong\" and the world today, Hemsworth talked about the role belief played in keeping the soldiers going those few weeks while in Afghanistan. He maintained that doubt would have been detrimental to their survival.\n\n\"You've got to have something to live for,\" Hemsworth stated. \"Whether it be family, or religion, the community, friends or your country. If you're fighting not just for your country [but] the people in your immediate group [then] you want to get back for something.\"\n\nThe action-packed film shows that Mitch Nelson had to say goodbye to a wife and a little girl. However, Mark Nutsch, the real-life captain who inspired the character, had two little boys (4 and 3 years old), and a wife who was six months pregnant when he left for war and she gave birth while he was away.

Pearson insists that anyone would try to save their father, no matter what they had done, and asks \"Are we more merciful than God?\"\n\nFollowing the real-life events, the movie presents how Pearson publicly renounces his belief in Hell, and comes to support \"a variation on universal reconciliation and the Gospel of Inclusion,\" which falls outside mainstream Christianity.\n\nPearson faces significant backlash from the faith community he shephered for his decision, which also leads to him being banned from the Oral Roberts University campus and being branded a heretic by numerous Christian leaders.\n\nThe pastor, who was a consultant on the film, set to be released in April, now serves as the leader of \"Streaming Consciousness Network\" in Chicago.\n\nAs the Hollywood Reporter said in a film review, \"this is a rare film about an evangelical church from outside the faith-based channels that questions without either judging or condescending.\"\n\n\"With unstinting compassion, the film traces the dismantling of all that Carlton and his congregation have built together, never losing sight of the personal cost to him as he continues to wrestle with his beliefs,\" it adds.\n\nSpeaking about the film with Tulsa World, Pearson said: \"When I watched the first draft, I didn't realize how raw my emotions still are.\n\n\"It was very tender for me. You think you're over something until you recall it and reconnect with it.\"\n\nDespite mainstream theological teachings, a survey by LifeWay Research in 2016 found that 64 percent of evangelicals believe everyone will go to Heaven, which was even higher than the 60 percent of the general American public who think the same.\n\nAt the same time, 84 percent of those with evangelical beliefs affirmed that Hell is a real place of eternal judgment. Only 30 percent of non-evangelicals said that they agree.\n\nOther popular megachurch pastors who have rejected Hell, and later left their church, include Rob Bell, once of Mars Hill Bible Church in Michigan.\n\nAlthough theologians, such as Dr. Albert Mohler Jr., president of The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky., have praised Bell as a \"master communicator,\" they have warned that such arguments \"alienate love from justice and holiness.\"\n\n\"Bell wants to rescue God from any teaching that His wrath is poured out upon sin and sinners, certainly in any eternally conscious sense,\" Mohler has argued.\n\n\"But Bell also wants God to vindicate the victims of murder, rape, child abuse, and similar evil. He seems not to recognize that he has undercut his own story, leaving God unable or unwilling to bring true justice.\"", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/megachurch-pastor-fights-against-belief-in-hell-in-netflix-film-based-on-real-events-214685/"}

Some of those means will be revealed when \u201cThe Memo\u201d is released. At first the clandestine means were intended simply to maintain their existing power structure. This included the disappearance of Lois Lerner\u2019s emails, the \u201cpoofing\u201d of Hillary Clinton\u2019s BleachBit data, the counting of votes from non-existing voters and voting machines and the magical disappearance of Trump votes.\n\nBut then the tide turned and they were forced to implement The Insurance Policy\u2122. Fake dossiers, illegal snooping, spying and all the requisite cover-ups that entailed. Which brings us to the Inconvenient Glitch\u2122:\n\nThousands of mobile phones used by the FBI were impacted by a glitch that resulted in the loss of text exchanges between bureau employees Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, Fox News reported on Wednesday. The Hill\n\nExcept it appears the \u201cGlitch\u201d was actually bigger \u2013 and longer \u2013 than originally noted.\n\nOfficials had indicated that the \u201cglitch\u201d that caused the texts to go missing had affected thousands of cellphones at the FBI. CBS News Justice Department reporter Paula Reid noted that the DOJ confirmed that the period time that data was lost for the other cellphones was longer than just five months, instead spanning an entire year. DailyWire\n\nCoincidently the \u201cGlitch\u201d covered the exact same timeframe that the Deep State covert activities were in high gear:\n\nNearly all of the groundwork that laid the foundation for the Russia investigation took place between June 2016 and May 2017.

Who benefits from this falsification of history?\u201d This article will answer these questions.\n\nBy John Wear\n\nThe first reason the Holocaust was invented was for justification for the war with Germany. World War II was by far the bloodiest and most destructive war in human history. Many people wondered whether all of the death and destruction caused by the war had been necessary.\n\nThe so-called Holocaust (alleged genocide of Jews) was used by the Allies to demonize Germany and prove that their war effort was necessary to defeat such an evil nation.\n\nWith the liberation of Ohrdruf, Buchenwald and Dachau by the American Army and the liberation of Bergen-Belsen by British troops, large groups of Western observers confronted the horrors of the German camps for the first time.\n\nThe gruesome scenes of huge piles of dead bodies and emaciated and diseased surviving inmates were filmed and photographed for posterity by the U.S. Army Signal Corps. Prominent newsmen and politicians were flown in to formerly German-occupied territory to see the harrowing evidence at the camps for themselves. The horrific scenes in the German-run camps were used by the Allies to justify their participation in the war.1\n\n\n\nJewish historian Robert Jan van Pelt writes:\n\nTo the Allies, the discovery of the camps proved a final justification of their war effort. In 1940, Churchill had proclaimed that a Nazi victory would bring \u201ca new dark age made more sinister by perverted science.\u201d The liberation of the camps proved that\n\nChurchill had not exaggerated the danger. And even though Auschwitz had been liberated by the Russians, the English and Americans heard many stories about that camp.2\n\nEstablishment of Israel\n\nThe Holocaust story has also been used to justify the creation of the nation-state of Israel. Simon Wiesenthal writes: \u201cThe creation of Israel was the only possible and the only correct reaction to Auschwitz. There had to be a country in the world where the Jews were the landlords instead of tolerated guests, a place of refuge in the truest meaning of the word, even for Jews who live in other countries.\u201d3\n\n\n\nDavid Ben-Gurion stated at the beginning of World War II that the war should end by giving the Zionists their own state. After the war, Ben-Gurion and other Israeli leaders said that the Holocaust had proven once again that the only solution to the Jewish problem was an independent state in Palestine. Ben-Gurion again mentioned during Adolf Eichmann\u2019s trial that the Holocaust happened because Jews did not live in their own country.4\n\n\n\nIsraeli historian Tom Segev explains why the Holocaust story is so important to Israel:\n\nIsrael differs from other countries in its need to justify\u2014to the rest of the world, and to itself\u2014its very right to exist. Most\n\ncountries need no such ideological justifications. But Israel does\u2014because most of its Arab neighbors have not recognized it\n\nand because most of the Jews of the world prefer to live in other countries. So long as these factors remain true, Zionism will be on\n\nthe defensive. As a justification for the state of Israel, the Holocaust is comparable only to the divine promise contained in the\n\nBible: It seems to be definitive proof of the Zionist argument that Jews can live in security and with full equal rights only in their\n\nown country and that they therefore must have an autonomous and sovereign state, strong enough to defend its existence.5\n\n\n\nTom Segev further writes, \u201cThe demonization of Nazism and its mythologizing, in general, were also necessary since the Holocaust served as the main justification for the creation and existence of the state of Israel.\u201d6\n\n\n\nJustification of Israeli Violence\n\nThere were at least 33 massacres of Palestinian villages during Israel\u2019s \u201cwar of independence.\u201d Zionist forces were larger and better equipped than their opponents, and by the end of the war over 750,000 Palestinians were ruthlessly expelled from their homes.7\n\nAs Segev writes, \u201cIsrael was born of terror, war, and revolution, and its creation required a measure of fanaticism and of\n\ncruelty.\u201d8\n\n\n\nEntire cities and hundreds of villages in Israel were left empty and repopulated with new Jewish immigrants.\n\nThe Jewish immigrants numbered 100,000 in April 1949, most of them survivors of the so-called Holocaust. The Palestinians lost everything they had and became destitute refugees, while the Jewish immigrants to Israel stole the Palestinians\u2019 property and confiscated everything they needed.9\n\n\n\nThe Holocaust story has been repeatedly used to justify Israel\u2019s aggression against its neighbors. Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin justified the demolition of an alleged Iraqi nuclear facility in June 1981 with the words, \u201cWe must protect our nation, a million and a half of whose children were murdered by the Nazis in the gas chambers.\u201d10\n\nBefore Israel\u2019s invasion of Lebanon in June 1982, Begin told his cabinet: \u201cYou know what I have done and what we have all done to prevent war and loss of life. But such is our fate in Israel. There is no way other than to fight selflessly. Believe me, the alternative is Treblinka, and we have decided that there will be no more Treblinkas.\u201d11\n\n\n\nA few weeks after Israel\u2019s invasion of Lebanon, Begin stated that after the Holocaust the international community had lost its right to demand that Israel answer for its actions. Begin declared in the Knesset, \u201cNo one, anywhere in the world, can preach morality to our people.\u201d A similar statement was included in the resolution adopted by Begin\u2019s cabinet after the massacres in Palestinian refugee camps on the outskirts of Beirut.12\n\nBy the late 1980s there was hardly a day when the Holocaust story was not mentioned in one of the Israeli newspapers. Such constant exposure encouraged many Israeli soldiers to plan ways to exterminate the Arabs. According to Israeli education-corps officer Ehud Praver, \u201ctoo many soldiers were deducing that the Holocaust justifies every kind of disgraceful action.\u201d13\n\n\n\nGerman Guilt\n\nThe so-called Holocaust has also been effectively used to induce guilt in the German people. As British historian Ian Kershaw writes: \u201cDecades would not fully erase the simple but compelling sentiment: \u2018I am ashamed to be German.\u2019 \u201d14\n\nFriedrich Grimm, a renowned German authority on international law, was shown samples of new leaflets printed in German soon after the war to be distributed by the Allies throughout Germany. Describing alleged German war crimes, the leaflets were the first step in the reeducation program designed for Germany. Grimm suggested to an Allied officer that since the war was over, it was time to stop the libel. The Allied officer replied:\n\nWhy no, we\u2019re just getting started. We\u2019ll continue this atrocity campaign, we\u2019ll increase it till no one will want to hear a good word about the Germans anymore, till whatever sympathy there is for you in other countries is completely destroyed, and\n\nuntil the Germans themselves become so mixed up they won\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing!15\n\nThe Allied campaign to make Germans feel guilty concerning the so-called Holocaust has been highly successful.\n\nGerman guilt feeling is so powerful it has caused the German government to make enormous reparations and offer humble apologies to the Allies, while ignoring the atrocities committed by the Allies against the German people during and after the war. Millions of German expellees have paid reparations to survivors of the German concentration camps\n\neven though these German expellees had their land and personal possessions stolen from them.\n\nJames Bacque writes in regard to German feelings of guilt:\n\nGuilt pervades Germany like a religion. It is the \u201cCanossa Republic,\u201d penitent in pain before its judges. Guilt is so powerful that it has caused the Canossa Republic repeatedly to deny any intention of reclaiming sovereignty over the eastern lands, although it is a\n\nwell-established UN principle that no government has the right to waive the claims of individuals to their property. Nor may it impede their right of return to their former homeland.16\n\nAllied Guilt and Apathy\n\nThe Allies have also been declared guilty of not doing more to prevent the alleged genocide of European Jewry. Jewish historian Deborah Lipstadt writes:\n\nA real antipathy toward Jews certainly affected the Allied response. While no one among the Allies or in the press wanted to see Jews killed, virtually no one was willing to advocate that steps be taken to try to stop the carnage. Many Allied officials in positions of power in London and Washington were tired of hearing about Jews and even more tired of being asked to do something about them even though there were steps that could have been taken.17\n\n\n\nElie Wiesel writes in regard to the Allies\u2019 failure to rescue European Jewry, \u201cIt almost seems as if both diplomats and\n\nstatesmen spent more time inventing reasons not to save the Jews than trying to find a way to save them.\u201d18\n\nU.S. presidents Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush have all made statements that the United States will never again fail to act to stop something as evil as the genocide of European Jewry. At the dedication of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, President Bill Clinton spoke in a similar vein: \u201cFor those of us here today representing the nations of the West, we must live forever with this knowledge: Even as our fragmentary awareness of\n\ncrimes grew into indisputable facts, far too little was done.\u201d19\n\nMichael Goldberg says in regard to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum: \u201cThe museum stands as a grim reminder that for all its purported ideals, America nevertheless turned its back on Jews fleeing Hitler. . . . Hence, the museum\u2019s recalling what happened to Jews in the past may move Americans and their national policymakers in Washington to\n\nsupport Israel in the present, lest in the future, the same fate lie in store for Jews again\u2014and the same moral failure await Americans once more.\u201d20\n\nPresident Barack Obama affirmed on the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Dachau: \u201c. . . we fervently vow that such atrocities will never happen again,\u201d and, \u201cHistory will not repeat itself.\u201d21\n\nOf course, Obama forgot to tell his audience that most of the inmates at Dachau died of natural causes. Obama also conveniently failed to mention that the single biggest atrocity that occurred at Dachau was the mass murder by American troops of 520 German guards on the day Dachau was liberated.22\n\n\n\nReparations to Jews\n\nGerman guilt for the so-called Holocaust has resulted in massive reparations being paid to Holocaust survivors and the state of Israel. German reparations to Jews were discussed from the beginning of World War II. Segev writes:\n\nThe idea [of reparations] seems to have been in the air from the time the war started, apparently sparked by the punitive reparations payments imposed on Germany at the end of World War I. Ben-Gurion received a memorandum on the subject as early as 1940. Berl Katznelson spoke of it publicly toward the end of that year. By December 1942, there was already a private organization in Tel Aviv called Justicia that offered to help Nazi victims draft compensation demands.23\n\n\n\nHatred of Germans in Israel was intense after the war. Many advocated a special law barring Israelis from all social contacts with German citizens. However, since most Israelis felt that the Germans owed them massive paybacks for the so-called Holocaust, Germany and Israel began negotiating reparations on March 20, 1952. The Luxembourg\n\nAgreement was reached six months later and committed the German government to paying massive reparations to Holocaust survivors.24\n\nNahum Goldmann said in a 1976 interview that the Luxembourg Agreement \u201cconstituted an extraordinary innovation in the matter of international rights.\u201d Goldmann also boasted that he had obtained 10 to 14 times more from the Bonn government than he had originally expected.25\n\n\n\nMillions of Jews eventually received personal compensation for their pain and suffering in the so-called Holocaust. The German federal government as of 1998 had paid reparations to Israel and Third Reich victims of about $61.8 billion. In addition, Germans had paid many additional billions in private and other public funds to wartime forced laborers.26\n\nGerman reparations to Israel and Jews continue to this day.27\n\nJewish Solidarity\n\nThe Holocaust story is described by many Jewish leaders as a uniquely evil event. An example of this view was expressed by Abraham H. Foxman when he was the national director of the Anti-Defamation League of B\u2019nai B\u2019rith:\n\nThe Holocaust is something different. It is a singular event. It is not simply one example of genocide but a near successful attempt on the life of God\u2019s chosen children and, thus, on God Himself. It is an event that is the antithesis of Creation as recorded in the Bible; and like its direct opposite, which is relived weekly with the Sabbath and yearly with the Torah, it must be remembered from generation to generation.28\n\nMichael Goldberg confirms that the Holocaust story has become a religion [sometimes called Holocaustianity\u2014Ed.] to many Jews: \u201cAs the Holocaust has become many contemporary Jews\u2019 master story, so, too, its perpetual observance has become their paramount Jewish practice, its veneration their religion. And as with any organized church, this Holocaust cult has its own tenets of faith, rites, and shrines.\u201d29\n\n\n\nIsraelis are obsessed with the history and heritage of the Holocaust. A 1992 study of Israeli college students found that close to 80% of those asked identified with the statement, \u201cWe are all Holocaust survivors.\u201d The so-called Holocaust has become a way for secular Jews to feel connected to their Jewish heritage.30\n\nThe Holocaust, commemorated ritually through the observance of Holocaust Remembrance Day, is a major means of creating solidarity among Jews. While some Jewish communities experience conflicts among Orthodox, Conservative and Reform Jews, they set aside their differences and join together to mourn the so-called Holocaust. Any truth in\n\nJudaism\u2019s slogan of \u201cJews Are One\u201d manifests itself ritually on Holocaust Remembrance Day.31\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nThe alleged genocide of European Jewry has been used to justify the Allied war effort, to establish the state of Israel, to justify Israel\u2019s violence against its neighbors, to induce guilt in both Germans and the Allied nations, to allow Jews to receive massive reparations from Germany and to create solidarity in the Jewish community. The extreme importance of the Holocaust story in advancing Zionist/Jewish interests ensures that this falsification of history will continue in the future.\n\nENDNOTES\n\n\n\nVan\n\nPelt, Robert Jan, The Case for Auschwitz: Evidence from the Irving Trial, Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 2002, p. 165.\n\n2\n\nIbid.\n\n3\n\nWiesenthal, Simon, Justice Not Vengeance: New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1989, p. 224.\n\n4\n\nSegev, Tom, The Seventh Million: The Israelis and the Holocaust, New York: Hill and Wang, pp. 82, 185, 330.\n\n5\n\nIbid., p. 514.\n\n6\n\nIbid., p. 480.\n\n7\n\nWeir, Alison, Against Our Better Judgement: The Hidden History of How the U.S. was Used to Create Israel, 2014, p. 58.\n\n8\n\nSegev, Tom, The Seventh Million: The Israelis and the Holocaust, New York: Hill and Wang, p. 63.\n\n9\n\nIbid., pp. 161-162.\n\n10\n\nIbid., p. 399.\n\n11\n\nIbid.\n\n12\n\nIbid.\n\n13\n\nIbid., pp. 407, 412.\n\n14\n\nKershaw, Ian, Hitler 1936-45: Nemesis, New York: W.

When Jesus sent out the disciples two by two, part of their instructions was to enter with the blessing, \u201cPeace to this house\u201d (Luke 10:5). In the Gospel of John, Jesus says, \u201cPeace I leave with you; my peace I give you\u201d (John 14:27). Every Advent, churches light a series of candles, one being the candle of peace.\n\nSo it should be pretty clear that peace is God\u2019s desire for us.\n\nBut then there\u2019s one interesting and difficult passage in the Gospel of Matthew where Jesus says, \u201cI did not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to turn \u2018a man against his father, a daughter against her mother \u2026 a man\u2019s enemies will be the members of his own household.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis seems to be a reversal or contradiction, but read in context, Jesus seems to be saying that allegiance to his kind of Kingdom will inevitably cause division with those who have different priorities. Peacemakers get in the way of warmongers. Justice hinders the power-brokers. Mercy impedes revenge. As Jesus points out, these divisions can and do happen within one\u2019s own family (how did your Thanksgiving go?).\n\nHere Jesus is describing what peace \u2014 properly understood \u2014 sometimes requires.\n\nIn the Hebrew Bible (aka Old Testament), the English word \u201cpeace\u201d is translating the Hebrew word shalom. Jesus and his Jewish listeners would have known the word well, and many commentators say the meaning of the word goes far beyond how English speakers usually think of \u201cpeace.\u201d\n\nRabbi David Zaslow wrote, \u201cContrary to popular opinion, the Hebrew word shalom does not mean \u2018peace,\u2019 at least not in the English sense of the word. It comes from a Hebrew root-word that means \u2018wholeness.\u2019\u201d Jewish philosopher Aviezer Ravitzky explained that \u201cshalom is most commonly used to refer to a state of affairs, one of well being \u2026 circumstances unblemished by any sort of defect.\u201d In other words, shalom is when things are they way God intended them to be. It is no trivial concept in the Bible. One Midrash teaching says, \u201cAll that is written in the Torah was written for the sake of shalom.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeace\u201d in the English language is often thought of as tranquility or the lack of conflict. But if shalom is the wholeness and well being of individuals or a community, then you can\u2019t have shalom without justice.\n\nSo, when we do something that takes a step toward shalom, it may very well \u201cdisturb the peace.\u201d\n\nMany people would rather \u201ckeep the peace\u201d \u2014 keep things quiet and the waters undisturbed. That\u2019s what many people who considered themselves allies of the cause of racial equality told Martin Luther King Jr. Seen best in his \u201cLetter from a Birmingham Jail,\u201d King went so far as to say that people who wanted him to stop stirring things up were a greater stumbling block than a klansman. He critiqued them for being \u201cmore devoted to order than to justice, [preferring] a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice.\u201d Shalom is \u201cpositive peace.\u201d\n\nJesus\u2019 quote about family members turning against each other is a reference to Micah, chapter 7, and it\u2019s very instructive to go back and look at the context of it. This is one chapter after Micah\u2019s well known statement that the Lord requires us to \u201cdo justly, love mercy, and walk humbly\u201d (6:8). The prophet is lamenting what Israel has become:\n\nYour rich people are violent,\n\nyour inhabitants are liars\n\nand their tongues speak deceitfully. (Micah 6:12)\n\nEveryone lies in wait to shed blood \u2026\n\nBoth hands are skilled in doing evil,\n\nthe ruler demands gifts,\n\nthe judge accepts bribes,\n\nthe powerful dictate what they desire. (Micah 7:2-3)\n\nThis was a common theme among the prophets and often why they pronounced God\u2019s judgment. Isaiah notably said:\n\nWoe to those who make unjust laws,\n\nto those who issue oppressive decrees,\n\nto deprive the poor of their rights\n\nand withhold justice from the oppressed of my people,\n\nmaking widows their prey\n\nand robbing the fatherless. (Isaiah 10:1-2)\n\nIn these days, I must say that I resonate with these prophetic laments. There is an urgent need to be ambassadors of shalom in today\u2019s world, but we may not be able to do it while \u201ckeeping the peace.\u201d It\u2019s a common sentiment that one should not discuss religion or politics in polite company, but perhaps that very reluctance and silence is how we\u2019ve managed to allow things denounced by the prophets to gain strong footholds among us.\n\nThe tax bill currently before congress is nothing short of the violence of the rich, as the prophet put it, making \u201cunjust laws\u201d and \u201coppressive decrees.\u201d In a new wave of nationalism and xenophobia, people who \u201cspeak deceitfully\u201d and bear false witness against minorities and the vulnerable have been given positions of power. There is too much \u201cshed blood\u201d in our proliferation of killing machines and among neglected communities. Micah\u2019s lament that \u201cthe ruler demands gifts \u2026 the powerful dictate what they desire\u201d is a pretty good description of lawmakers voting on bills they haven\u2019t read that were crafted by special interest groups (a reality that is not new but that they used to at least try to hide).\n\nNone of this is shalom. Ambassadors of shalom \u2014 \u201cpeacemakers\u201d as Jesus put it \u2014 have our work cut out for us. As we work for shalom, we face the reality of well-funded and well-organized people working against it. Shalom is not profitable for the few, nor does it satisfy vengeance, but it is the work of Christ. Being a peacemaker is not for the faint of heart. It requires love of enemy. It requires the opening of our hearts and ears to the other, a courageous act in a political climate in which we are actively being turned against one another. This is not left vs. right \u2014 this is shalom and well being vs. self destruction.\n\nRabbi Zaslow offers a powerful challenge: \u201cThe peace movement \u2026 is not liberal or conservative, it is both liberal and conservative. It is not left wing or right wing, it flies with two wings. It is not religious vs. secular, rather it integrates the genius of both science and spirituality.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve \u201ckept the peace\u201d for too long. It\u2019s time to \u201cseek peace and pursue it\u201d (Ps. 34:14).", "domain": "baptistnews.com", "label": 0, "url": "https://baptistnews.com/article/keeping-peace-can-obstacle-true-peace/"}

Now it sneaks up on you softly, usually under the guise of solving a phony problem like \u201chate speech\u201d or \u201cfake news\u201d:\n\nGermany recently enacted a law that allows the government to censor social media and fine related companies that won\u2019t take down what government officials deem fake news or hate speech. France isn\u2019t far behind. French President Emmanuel Macron proposed a ban on fake news, especially around election time, \u201cin order to protect democracy.\u201d And on Tuesday, U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May announced the creation of a commission to respond to fake news called the National Security Communications Unit.\n\nAll news is fake to the extent that it is biased, if only in what it chooses to cover. It does not become less fake by supporting the point of view favored by the government. People have to decide for themselves what sources are relatively credible.\n\nAs for factually inaccurate news,\n\nA recent study concluded that while fake news often spreads far with the help of tools such as social media, it has a shallow impact on what Americans believe. This begs the question of why near-authoritarian measures would be implemented that so badly undermine free speech rights.\n\nNow there\u2019s an easy question.

Yet, the 80-year-old Argentinian evangelist says there are still a few special locales remaining on his bucket list of places to bring the Good News.\n\nPalau, who recently preached to an estimated 60,000 people in New York City's famous Central Park, has \"personally shared the Gospel with more than 30 million people through evangelistic events in more than 75 nations, and hundreds of millions more through radio and television,\" according to his self-named ministry, The Luis Palau Association.\n\nIn the first of a two-part interview with The Christian Post, Palau comments on his most recent campaign, NY CityFest-CityServe, which brought together 1,700 local churches to assist their communities and schools through service projects. He also shares what he has learned by working with the NYC Latino evangelical community and lists some of the top places around the world where he would still like to preach.\n\nThe interview was conducted on Saturday, July 11, before Palau was to deliver his main message on stage at NY CityFest in Central Park. The transcript has been edited for clarity, and the questions re-worded for better context.\n\n(Photo: The Luis Palau Association) Evangelist Luis Palau speaks on stage on the Great Lawn at Central Park on July 11, 2015, in New York City.\n\nCP: What is the NY CityFest Central Park event about?\n\nPalau: Today (Saturday, July 11) is a climax of sorts of a certain wave but it will carry on. This now will go on, God willing, for many years. The cooperation is growing among churches. The number of churches, I think, is growing. Some, the minority churches, the Latinos particularly, but others also, have always felt a little isolated. I think now they feel more integrated, properly so. I think there's going to be in the future more working together. I hope the Latinos, senior people who have authority over congregations or denominations, that they will see that this is an opportunity to lead the Body of Christ, the Church, forward.\n\nSome that I thought have a reputation in town, but have not involved themselves, I think have forfeited the authority over some ... many, many currents of the evangelical movement and they've forfeited their authority and they'll never recuperate it.\n\nMany of the pastors who are small church pastors, the vast majority have to work two jobs, they're bi-vocational. I honor them for that. I just bow before these fellows, who with their families have two jobs: pastoring a church and working for a cash-living. I honor their faithfulness and the spouse's faithfulness. So we learned it by accident. We wanted to have a meeting at 10 a.m. and none of the churches appeared, only a few hot shots who had a secretary and an assistant, you know. Then we realized, they're working that's why.\n\nThose Latino fellows, and there are others, too, I think that these guys are gonna be leaders in the future. And not the long-term future. I was exhorting some of them right on the platform: \"It's your chance to bless the Body and lead the Body of Christ.\" Because the Body of Christ needs leadership, not authoritative or from the top down, but just moral, spiritual, motivational, in the Holy Spirit. \u2026 Motivate God's people to witness and to serve and do it in fellowship. That was the prayer of the Lord Jesus.\n\nI've been speaking in a lot in the churches the last two years and one of my main themes is John 17: Father, may they be one so that the world may believe that you sent me. So (Jesus') great passion was that \"the world may believe that they sent me.\" How is that done? By uniting the Body. How do you unite the Body? By being filled with the indwelling Christ, because He says, \"Father, you in me and I in them so that we may be perfectly one.\"\n\nWhat makes us one is not the form of baptism or that we have male or female pastors or secondary issues, but it's Christ in us. That gives us the motivation to love. Anyway, long sermon there. But it's true, it's important. And I think the leadership of the evangelical movement of New York is gonna change hands. It was in hands that refused to use the authority that God gave them and now I think you're gonna see Latinos, Jamaicans, Koreans \u2014 I was excited to be in a Korean church where they really tried to bring in Latinos, and they did, quite a bit. They have to keep working on it, because there are cultural things and so on.\n\nCP: What is going to happen when you pack up and leave NYC?\n\nPalau: Well, I hope people will be relieved (laughs). I think what will happen is now they'll really get going. So I think that they will get going to what we've been talking about, keep doing more of the same, keep multiplying the unity. I sure hope they follow, and I think every intention is that. I hope that those who kinda sat on the sidelines because they're too busy will come to realize that the Scripture urges us to be one, and act like one and push like one.\n\nCP: I read a report on you from a couple of years ago that said you had a dream about preaching in New York \u2026\n\nPalau: Not a dream-dream, just in my heart, you know. When Billy Graham had his crusade here in 1957 at the old Madison Square Garden, I got bulletins. They put out a bulletin everyday. It was three months at the old Madison Square Garden, every night. And they put out a bulletin of conversions and what they were gonna do this week, and da-da-da. A missionary's kid who was studying in Toronto came down to help that summer and he mailed it to me. Every two or three days he'd put it in an envelope, and I read it and I thought, \"Someday I'm gonna preach in New York.\"\n\nThat was the dream \u2026 a vision, a desire, you know. Because New York is like Buenos Aires, very big, kind of pretends to be self-sufficient. I think since 9/11 a bit of that has been chopped off, you know, a little less chip on the shoulder kind of thing. But New York and Buenos Aries are alike that way.\n\nCP: Would you say that today is the fulfillment of that dream or big desire?\n\nPalau: Well, yes. Now, evangelists you know, if you give them 60,000, they want 120,000, give them 120,000 they want 250,000, so you have that. We could have had more if the police hadn't put the barrier around you know. I'm not blaming the police, they're doing what the law demands. If we had a free place, there could have been 300,000, 400,000 people easily. But still, who doesn't rejoice to see a crowd like this one, cheering the Lord, worshipping and standing for so many hours. But the Holy Spirit is at work in New York. \u2026 There's a great hunger in New York. There is spiritual hunger \u2026\n\nCP: You are 80 years old, you've preached in countless countries before millions of people. What's next for you?\n\nPalau: I'd like to go to Cuba. You know, we're working on that because I couldn't go in the past for various reasons. I dream of having a large campaign in Paris, France. And of course, number one in my book, is Beijing, China. We have been going in and out of China now for 15 years and we're still waiting for the day that the Lord might open the door. \u2026 I want to have a million Chinese in Tiananmen Square.

Filmmakers are hoping to have it released in Latin America and the USA in October 2018.\n\n\"It's quite surreal watching someone take on your persona and story. They just created a Facebook page so you can follow along.

We are here at the wardrobe fitting preparing for next Monday [when] we are going to start our film 'Palau'!\" Pauls announced.\n\n\"Palau,\" which is currently the title of the film, was writen and is being directed by Kevin Knoblock.\n\nAlso featured in the film are Alexandra Bard (who plays Palau's wife, Pat), Santiago Achaga, (22-year-old Luis Palau), Agustin Amoedo (10-year-old Luis Palau), Fabian Carrasco (Palau's father, Luis Sr.), Darren Dowler (Billy Graham) and more.\n\n(Photo: Facebook/Palau Movie) Luis Palau, Gaston Pauls and movie production staff during a meeting in Portland, November 14, 2017. \u00b7\n\nPalau was joined by his two sons, Kevin and Andrew, on Thursday to reveal that Palau was diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer recently.\n\n\"We wanted to tape this video to tell the whole world that love dad and the work that we do what's been going on in dad's life,\" Kevin, president of Luis Palau Ministries, said in the social media video posted Thursday.\n\n\"To our surprise, the early report that we got just before Christmas [said] that there was some cancer inside one of dad's lungs,\" Kevin explained.\n\nThey got extra testing done and went to an oncologist who revealed the terminal diagnosis.\n\n\"Just a few days ago we got the word that it's stage 4 lung cancer. That's a shock, especially with someone who's always been as healthy as dad,\" he continued.\n\nPalau added that's it's been an emotional time for him. He confessed that the first thing he did was cry.\n\n\"I think 'oh wow, I can be gone in a few months' and one silly thought that came to mind is that I won't be able to pick up the phone and talk to the boys and hear their voice and talk to my wife,\" he emotionally shared.\n\n\"This is sad, I don't feel panic or horror. If [I'm] healed, hallelujah! And many people are praying that the Lord will do a miracle. It would take literally a miracle, medically speaking.\"\n\nDespite the sad news, production on \"Palau\" the movie will continue and the 83-year-old is remaining optimistic that he will be around to see all the Lord will do the rest of the year.

That is to say, the \"consensus that has existed amongst most conservative evangelicals for some time is beginning to fracture \u2014 and in more than one direction.\"\n\nCentral to this discussion is the role of women in ministry. Complementarians generally believe that women are forbidden from holding certain offices in the Church, while egalitarians insist that Scripture does not warrant such restrictions.\n\nHere are five things you should know about this ongoing, often-spirited theological debate.\n\n1. History and tradition favors the complementarian viewpoint.\n\nTheologians Gregory A. Boyd and Paul R. Eddy explore this topic in their book, Across the Spectrum: Understanding Issues in Evangelical Theology, and note that \"the complementarian view has been the dominant view throughout Church history. The Church has always encouraged and valued the significant contributions of women in many areas of ministry, but the Church has almost always forbidden women leaders until recent times.\"\n\nThe authors further note that \"there is a diversity of opinion on the matter, many complementarians interpret the New Testament prohibitions regarding women in leadership to mean only that women should not function as the top spiritual leader and teacher of a congregation.\"\n\n2. Whether or not women are permitted to serve the Church in an ordained capacity often centers on seemingly straight-forward New Testament scriptures like 1 Timothy 2:12, 1 Timothy 3:2, and 1 Corinthians 11:7-9.\n\nThe words of the Apostle Paul to his spiritual son in 1 Timothy 2:12 read: \"But I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man, but to remain quiet.\"\n\nComplementarians argue that this verse is among the clearest scriptural evidence for support of their stance.\n\nIn an interview with the Gospel Coalition in 2008, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary New Testament professor Andreas J. K\u00f6stenberger said that those who hold to complete gender equality not just in \"terms of personal worth and dignity and salvation in Christ but also in terms of ecclesiastical role, naturally cannot accept this natural reading of the passage and as a result have resorted to various ways of reinterpreting [it],\" and fail to meet several essential exegetical criteria for biblical interpretation.\n\nBy contrast, egalitarians contend that this verse is addressing a particular context and that Paul's writing here should not be taken as a blanket prohibition.\n\nIn a widely read article on his Patheos blog last summer, renown New Testament scholar and Asbury Seminary professor Ben Witherington III notes that the translation of the phrase \"I do not allow a woman\" in the Greek is most accurately rendered \"I am not currently permitting women.\" Paul is correcting women in this case, he emphasizes, \"not because they are women but because they are in this instance causing this problem [interrupting and asking questions at an inappropriate time].\"\n\n(Photo: Courtesy of Paul Lee) Messengers at the 2015 Southern Baptist Convention annual meeting worship together in between small group and corporate prayer time during the June 16 evening session dedicated to prayer at the Greater Columbus Convention Center.\n\n3. Some of the contentiousness surrounding this issue has stemmed from assertions some leaders have made about women in roles outside the Church, roles that the Bible does not speak to with pristine clarity.\n\nComplementarian John Piper responded last year to the question, \"Should Women Be Police Officers?\" with a lengthy explanation \u2014 admitting he sounded like a \"dinosaur\" \u2014 about continuums of influence and appropriateness of certain jobs. He concluded that \"if a woman's job involves a good deal of directives toward men, they will need to be non-personal in general, or men and women won't flourish in the long run in that relationship without compromising profound biblical and psychological issues.\"\n\nOwen Strachan, also a complementarian, and the former head of the Council for Biblical Manhood and Womanhood, caught some heat for saying that stay-at-home dads constitute \"man fails\" in a 2012 article in the Journal for Biblical Manhood and Womanhood.\n\n4. Egalitarians are sometimes told that supporting women in ministry in ordained leadership roles opens the door to revisionist sexual ethics and same-sex unions, a charge they dispute.\n\nHistorically speaking, some denominations, like the Episcopal Church USA, that have ordained women have also sanctioned same-sex unions and promoted openly gay clergy, but this is not true of everyone. The Pentecostal Assemblies of God, for example, hold fast to the historic Christian view of marriage and sexual ethics and simultaneously believe that women can serve in ordained ministry, according to their position papers.\n\nIn a phone interview with The Christian Post on Monday, Asbury's Ben Witherington said the slippery-slope argument from complementarians about egalitarians embracing revisionist sexual ethics is \"bogus\" and contends these are separate issues entirely.\n\n\"That's kind of like saying, 'Well, if I kind of like boxing well then obviously it's also true that I'm going to be supporting MMA and all kinds of other atrocious activities.' You're comparing two things that really shouldn't be compared,\" Witheringon said.\n\n\"The New Testament is very clear that same-sex sexual activity is sin. The New Testament is equally clear that women should be allowed to be teachers and sharers of the Gospel ... the promotion of women in ministry has to do with what spiritual gifts they have, it does not have to do with their gender one way or the other,\" he added.\n\n5. Egalitarians point to women in leadership in the New Testament for scriptural support for their position.\n\nJunia is identified as an Apostle in Romans 16:7.\n\nPhoebe was a leader in the church in Cenchrea and is called first person ever identified as a \"deacon\" (Romans 16:1), though some translations of the Bible label her as \"servant.\"\n\nPriscilla is sometimes thought to be the author of Hebrews and both she and Aquila taught Apollos, (Acts 18:26).\n\nPaul also calls Euodia and Syntyche co-workers in the same breath as Clement and many others, (Philippians 4:2-3).", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/5-things-you-should-know-about-the-women-in-ministry-debate-168429/"}

He has spent many hours reading on sexuality-related topics and speaking with friends who identify as all sorts of things and concluded that \"this specific conversation is ten times more complicated than most people realize, and a thousand times more complicated than article 7 makes it out to be.\"\n\nAbout the same time as the publication of the Nashville Statement, Sprinkle released a 20-minute film called, \"Dear Church: I'm Gay.\" While the film makes a point to endorse the historic Christian view of sexuality, it delves deeply into the pastoral nuances and complexities, telling the stories of several Christians who have had various levels of experience with same-sex attraction and homosexuality. Also included in the short film is the story of a noncelibate gay man who no longer believes his Christian faith but whose parents are Christian and have stayed in relationship with him even as they do not agree with homosexual practice.\n\n\"While we absolutely need to celebrate and promote Christianity's historic view of marriage and sexual expression,\" Sprinkle reiterated, he emphaized that \"we need to do so much more thoughtfully and much more holistically\u2014pounding the pulpit for truth and grace.\"\n\nIn similar fashion, Pastor Josh Daffern of MTV Church in Columbus, Mississippi, thought the Nashville Statement lacked pastoral wisdom and that it contained a few \"fatal\" flaws that gave him enough reason to never sign it.\n\n\"This statement reminds me of a married couple that constantly has arguments,\" Daffern wrote on his Patheos blog Tuesday, noting that as a conservative evangelical pastor he had \"no qualms with the individual tenets\" of the statement but, like Sprinkle, objected to some of the language used in it. And, he continued, the Nashville Statement was crafted mostly by academics and scholars who are mostly sealed off from people who do not think like them and that the document ultimately impedes the Great Commission.\n\nDaffern mentioned that he has a lesbian woman who has been attending his church for about a month and is reportedly battling addictions and is struggling with several other issues in her life.\n\n\"If I preached on the Nashville Statement and declared my allegiance, would that help or hinder her own spiritual journey?\" he asked. \"Why would I be more comfortable with pastors and not Christian academics creating this document? Because orthodoxy divorced from relationships can many times lead to rhetoric that hinders (not helps) us achieve our overall mission, to lead all people to Jesus,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't disagree with the document. I disagree with the tone in which it was presented. I disagree with the vacuum within which it was created, and I disagree with the rhetoric this will now create that will only further drive a wedge between evangelical Christians and the LGBT community.\"", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/nashville-statement-is-biblical-but-lacks-pastoral-wisdom-further-alienates-lgbt-persons-scholars-198029/"}

We request that this banner be removed.\"\n\nJayne's letter cited Supreme Court rulings, such as its decision in Stone v. Graham, a 1980 case in which the court struck down a Kentucky law requiring the Ten Commandments to be placed on the walls of every public school classroom.\n\n\"Messages that are affixed to school walls, or in this case, the outside of the school's stadium, are attributable to the school. Such messages are government speech, not private speech,\" Jayne asserted. \"It makes no difference if the church message is paid advertising. Given the banner size, prominent location, and inclusion of the school logo and name of the school's football team, the banner is plainly attributable to the school and must not include religious messages or promote places of worship.\"\n\nAccording to an FFRF press release issued last week, it didn't take long for Lantrip to respond to Jayne's letter.\n\nFFRF reports that Lantrip sent an email, explaining that the banner in question had been taken down.\n\n\"The district did the right thing by taking down a divisive religious message,\" FFRF Co-President Annie Laurie Gaylor said in a statement. \"Sporting events should unite the district community, not alienate certain members.\"\n\nAccording to The Greenfield Daily Reporter, the banner's placement at the football stadium was the inspiration of Lead Pastor Rev. Adam Detamore, who approached the school months ago with the idea for the banner and presented officials with the design of the banner.\n\nDetamore said that the words \"I can do all things\" were picked for the banner because it provided a motivational message of \"Let's go get them; let's do it.\" He added that the phrase is often used by Christian NBA star Steph Curry.\n\n\"[The school's decision] does not change that we want to invest in the school and serve them,\" Detamore explained. \"We have a great relationship with the school. Our intention behind the banner was simply to show support and love for our community.\"\n\nAlthough many government agencies and school districts cave when pressured by groups like FFRF, some put up a fight. Most recently, a town in Florida has taken steps to prepare itself for a potential lawsuit that could arise from its refusal to remove a cross from a veterans memorial.\n\nEarlier this month, the city council of town of Vero Beach voted to accept free legal services from the Liberty Counsel, a national religious freedom legal group, after it received a complaint from FFRF over a 19-inch cross sitting atop the city's \"Lest We Forget\" monument.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/high-school-removes-church-banner-from-football-stadium-after-atheist-groups-complaint-210546/"}

The reality is their threatening letters have caused many agencies to cave for fear of being forced to pay for the expense of defending against even a frivolous lawsuit. We are no different. The Washington Parish Sheriff's Office simply cannot afford the cost of defending a lawsuit of this nature.\"\n\nSeal concluded by stating that his office's mission is to enforce the law and protect its citizens.\n\n\"Under my tenure as Sheriff of Washington Parish we have worked hard to improve the quality of life for residents of Washington Parish. My family and I love Washington Parish. It is our home. It is an honor to serve as your Sheriff,\" he wrote. \"My belief that Jesus is my Lord and Savior has not changed!!\"\n\nSeal told The Christian Post through Facebook that he plans to formally respond to CP's request for comment on the matter by no later than Tuesday.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/atheist-group-ffrf-louisiana-sheriff-removal-christian-facebook-posts-213680/"}

Instead, as the success of films like \u201cGod\u2019s Not Dead,\u201d \u201cWoodlawn\u201d and \u201cWar Room\u201d prove, they can captivate audiences while simultaneously uplift, encourage, and inspire them.\n\nHowever, it seems Hollywood hasn\u2019t quite gotten the memo.\n\nToday, even movies rated \u201cG\u201d and \u201cPG\u201d or touted as \u201cfamily-friendly\u201d include the kind of content many parents don\u2019t want to put in front of their children. Far too often, parents are forced to grab the remote and hit the \u201cmute\u201d button to protect their children from unexpected sexual innuendo and crude jokes.\n\nTo combat this unfortunate reality, PureFlix.com, a streaming video-on-demand service focused on faith and family programming, offers thousands of movies and TV shows that are safe for the whole family.\n\nFor parents seeking to give their families a clean, uplifting alternative to much of what Hollywood puts out, PureFlix.com is offering a free one-month trial to its video streaming services with thousands of titles. With access to movies and shows ranging from classics like \"The Little Rascals\" and \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\" to newer titles including \"Woodlawn\" and \"God's Not Dead 2\", there's an option for every taste and interest.\n\nHere are nine reasons parents should subscribe to PureFlix.com -- the family-friendly, Christian alternative to Netflix.\n\nExposure to Media is Unavoidable - Why Not Make it a Positive Experience?\n\nLike it or not, exposure to mass media is unavoidable. From online platforms like YouTube to movies, streaming services, and TV, we live in a culture irreversibly saturated by screens.\n\nAccording to the American Academy of Pediatrics website, children between the ages of 2 and 18 spend an average of three hours each day watching television -- and the influence of media on the psychosocial development of little ones is profound. It\u2019s estimated that by age 18, a U.S. youth will have seen 16,000 simulated murders and 200,000 acts of violence. Additionally, the more sexual content that kids see on television, the earlier they initiate sexual activity.\n\nLike other popular streaming services, PureFlix.com started in 2015, offers a wide variety of choices ranging from action movies and romantic dramas to comedy series. Yet, PureFlix.com\u2019s goal is unique in that it aims to provide a wholesome viewing experience for your entire family that is fun, entertaining, inspirational, and even educational.\n\nWhat Your Children Watch Will Impact Their Values\n\nFor better or worse, media has an enormous impact on our children\u2019s values, beliefs, and behaviors. Statistics show that kids who view violent acts on TV are more likely to show aggressive behavior and may become less sensitive to the pain and suffering of others.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that paying attention to what our kids are exposed to via technology is of the utmost importance. Be intentional with your media consumption. Philippians 4:8 puts it this way: \"Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy\u2014meditate on these things.\"\n\nThe options available at PureFlix.com prove that reinforcing positive behavior to your children via technology is not only possible, it\u2019s incredibly easy. The family-friendly and Christian movies and TV shows available on PureFlix.com are accessible online or on your mobile phone, tablet, Roku, Apple TV, or Amazon Fire TV.\n\nMovie Night Allows You to Spend Time as a Family\n\nBecause every option on PureFlix.com is safe for the whole family, movie nights are made easy.\n\nInstead of being exposed to content that contradicts Biblical values, your family will enjoy wholesome films with storylines, themes, and characters you can trust.\n\nSetting aside time for your family on a regular basis lets them know just how much they mean to you. Some great, family-friendly options for movie night include Amazing Love starring \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d actor Sean Astin; Midrange, an intimate portrait of how one aspiring basketball star is suddenly forced to re-examine his life, loyalty, love, and his own limitations; and Woodlawn, the real-life story of how one gifted high school football player learns to embrace his talent and his faith as he battles racial tensions on and off the field.\n\nFamily movie night also has positive effects on married couples, as spending time with your spouse may result in better intimacy and increased communication. Watching movies with your loved ones is not only an enjoyable activity for everyone, it also strengthens family bonds in a powerful way.\n\nPureFlix Offers Options to Reinforce Family Values and Spark Important Conversations\n\nWhat sort of message is the entertainment in your house passing on to your children? As earlier noted, from YouTube to TV and movies, media has a strong and undeniable impact on children\u2019s thoughts, beliefs, and behavior. Estimates are that by the age of 17, the average child will have consumed 65,000 hours of media, compared to about 11,000 hours that the child will spend in school and more than 32 times the number of hours they will spend with a parent.\n\nPureFlix.com is a clean, Christian video streaming service that only carries films and shows that will reinforce your family\u2019s Christ-centered values. Films like Healed by Grace, I\u2019m Not Ashamed, or God\u2019s Not Dead 2, will allow you to talk to your children about how characters handled fictional situations and spark important conversations. PureFlix.com makes it easy to watch movies that tell tales of heroism, self-sacrifice, bravery, and kindness, thus instilling those values in your kids.\n\nIn a society inundated with negativity, it\u2019s important to make sure that television and movies support your family\u2019s ideals.\n\nPureFlix Provides Movies, Documentaries, and TV Series That are Both Entertaining and High-Quality\n\nIn the past, Christians have complained about the quality of faith-based entertainment -- but that\u2019s all changing. The facts speak for themselves: the Pure Flix box office film \u201cGod\u2019s Not Dead\u201d grossed $62 million on a $2 million dollar budget, proving it is possible to make quality, uplifting films suitable for the whole family.\n\nIt\u2019s undeniable: Christian movies aren\u2019t what they used to be -- and that\u2019s a good thing; for the most part, faith-based entertainment no longers sacrifices quality for the message. PureFlix believes in infiltrating culture and bringing light to dark places, and they\u2019ll continue to do exactly that through quality, Christ-centered entertainment.\n\nPureFlix Allows You to Control Entertainment Messages\n\nWe\u2019ve all been there. It\u2019s family movie night, and you\u2019re cuddled on the couch with your loved ones and a big bowl of popcorn, eager to watch a film you\u2019ve been waiting months to see. Of course, the film was touted as \u201cfamily friendly\u201d and rated PG, so you assumed your family would be safe.\n\nTen minutes into the film, you find yourself awkwardly reaching for the remote, blushing at the sexual innuendo casually thrown out by the protagonist. You\u2019re disappointed, embarrassed, and frustrated.\n\nWith many entertainment options, parents never know what they\u2019re going to see next. Unfortunately, even exhaustive research and careful combing of movie reviews isn\u2019t enough to protect your family from exposure to unwanted content.\n\nWith your free one-month trial to PureFlix.com, you can easily find wholesome films with content you can trust -- they\u2019ve already done all the research for you. Thanks to PureFlix, you not only have access to thousands of movies and TV shows completely free, you don\u2019t have to worry about your children being exposed to damaging entertainment.\n\nPureFlix Provides Educational, Biblically-Sound Options for Children\n\nThere are plenty of educational children\u2019s movies and documentaries out there -- unfortunately, many of them promote ideas or values that contradict the Bible, from evolution to issues of gender and sexuality identity.\n\nPureflix.com provides a number of documentaries, movies, and series that are both educational and entertaining. From a fascinating, in-depth documentary about Abraham Lincoln to live science experiments, these options will reinforce what your children are learning in a fun way.\n\nFor the homeschooling family, PureFlix.com provides plenty of options to complement your homeschool curriculum. There\u2019s an entire section of films based on books that are truly safe for everyone in your family, from the youngest to the eldest member. Get lost on the adventure with Tom Sawyer, frolic through the fields with your canine friends in \u201cWhere the Red Fern Grows,\u201d or even travel back in time with heroes of the Bible. Learning can and should be fun!\n\nThe best part -- all of these options are not only educational, they seek to change our culture for Christ.\n\nSubscribing to PureFlix Will Save You Money\n\nFamily movie night can sometimes be an exhausting -- and expensive endeavor. By the time you\u2019ve paid for your movie tickets, drinks, and popcorn for your whole family, you\u2019ve spent far more than you anticipated. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if you could watch free, full-length films from the comfort of your couch -- without worrying about whether they\u2019re appropriate for your family?\n\nFortunately, PureFlix.com solves this very problem, providing thousands of clean, family-friendly films and TV shows completely free for a full month when you sign up at www.pureflix.com.

Unfortunately, many of the values touted by Hollywood through film and television directly contradict those of the Church. As biblical principles continue to disappear from Hollywood, so do uplifting, faith-based films.\n\nHowever, this wasn\u2019t always the case; in the 1930s, '40s and '50s, the Church heavily influenced the movie-making industry. In the early '60s, however, the Church pulled out of Hollywood - and the meteoric rise in sex and violence seen in movies since then is undeniable. According to a 2016 study by the Parents Television Council, \"The amount and intensity of adult content on TV-PG shows is increasing, yet the TV-PG rating does not reflect these changes. Consequently, children are exposed to more adult content, even when parents choose TV-PG rated programs.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s time for the Church to once again get involved.\n\nNow more than ever, we need to support uplifting and Christian movies so that biblical principles stay in the popular media and in the entertainment we all consume on a daily basis. By actively engaging in the film and television industry instead of avoiding or condemning it, Christians can have a powerful voice - and can challenge the view that they are a small market.\n\nPureFlix.com CEO Greg Gudorf puts it this way: \"For so long, the Church has warned against the dangers of media and preached that we should move away from it. But, our human nature is we're hooked, we're addicted. You can tell an addict it's not good for them, but unless you show the addict an alternative, it becomes difficult. Of course, the Church has got the best alternative in the simple words of Jesus Christ Himself. In the media world, we want to make sure those messages come through.\"\n\nActively invest in keeping the faith alive in the culture, and become a member of PureFlix.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nPure Flix, the company behind the 60-million-dollar film \"God's Not Dead,\" has an online streaming service at PureFlix.com.

If you have never seen the television program Hunting Hitler you might want to check it out.\n\nThis television show is working to prove that Hitler actually survived the war and fled to Argentina. This show began broadcasting back in 2015 and is compiled by a group of specialists who are working to expose the truth about Hitler in current times. According to documents that were declassified back in 2014 by the FBI the idea that Hitler may have survived and is more likely than anyone is willing to admit.\n\nIn this series, a CIA veteran goes over the possible escape routes that Hitler could have used to make his escape. Could Hitler have actually spent the rest of his years after his possible escape living a normal life after everything that happened? Why else would it have taken German officials 11 whole years to declare Hitler\u2019s death officially? Sounds a bit sketchy to me.\n\nThe FBI file mentioned above is heavily redacted so there is most likely something that we need to know that of course, we are not being told. This FBI report is dated for September 21st, 1945 and tells the story of a man who aided six top Argentinian officials in landing Hitler onto Argentine soil via submarine and hid him in the foothills of the Andes Mountains. With that being said, this part of the report was not verifiable during the time because something that was considered to be important could not be located. You can look at this document below.\n\nDeclassified FBI documents by amacias2928 on Scribd\n\nWhat do you think, could Hitler have actually managed to escape? I for one am on the fence about this whole thing. Take a look at the trailer for Hunting Hitler below and feel free to check out the show.

Since 2005, the company has produced, distributed, and acquired thousands of Christ centered movies, documentaries and TV series, including the $60 million-grossing film \"God's Not Dead.\"\n\nIn 2015, Pure Flix launched a streaming video services, PureFlix.com, which like Netflix and Hulu, offers the first month free and gives viewers the option to choose from thousands of titles without paying a fee. Unlike other popular streaming services, however, PureFlix.com screens every documentary, family sitcom, and inspirational short film offered to ensure it\u2019s safe for the whole family.\n\nWe live in a sight and sound culture -- and like it or not, exposure to screens is unavoidable. Statistics show that on average, American adults are watching five hours and four minutes of television per day. About 50 percent of Americans now have subscription services like Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu in their homes, and that number is only increasing.\n\nIn turn, children aged five to 16 spend an average of six and a half hours a day in front of a screen compared with around three hours in 1995, according to market research firm Childwise. Estimates are that by the age of 17, the average child will have consumed 65,000 hours of media, whether it\u2019s watching TV, playing games consoles, using a mobile, computer or tablet.\n\nResearch has also shown that better or worse, media has an enormous impact on our -- and our children\u2019s -- values, beliefs, and behaviors. Children who view violent acts on TV are more likely to show aggressive behavior and may become less sensitive to the pain and suffering of others. Additionally, the more sexual content that kids see on television, the earlier they initiate sexual activity.\n\nThe message is clear: filling your kids\u2019 heads with positive and uplifting content is of the utmost importance. Because 100% of the content available on PureFlix.com is a clean, safe alternative to much of what Hollywood puts out, monitoring your family\u2019s media consumption is made easy. Instead of grabbing the remote to skip over scenes filled with sexual innuendo, violence, and inappropriate language, you\u2019ll be able to sit back, relax, and enjoy Christ-centered entertainment with the whole family.\n\nFollowing a free, 30-day trial, the Pure Flix streaming service is available for $10.99/month or an annual subscription at $99.99.

It was after that ceremony that he encountered the interfaith group posing for their photo and the awkward incident took place.\n\nTapio had actually lambasted the event one day earlier, in a lengthy press release . In it, he accused the interfaith group of having \u201ccontempt for those Americans concerned about an endless war on terror,\u201d reiterating his belief that Muslims predominantly believe people should be killed for leaving Islam.\n\n\u201cPatriotic Americans simply believe it is our responsibility to identify the real source of terror and to keep that hateful and deadly ideology out of the United States, out of South Dakota and out of our local communities,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cWhile cultural messages of inclusiveness are important, I think it\u2019s far more important that we respect the sacrifice and tremendous grief of South Dakota\u2019s military families and those who have suffered so deeply in this ongoing war against Islamic terror, both at home and abroad.\u201d\n\nHe went on to describe Islam as \u201ca hateful and deadly ideology.\u201d Tapio said, \u201cThere were 50 Somali people in Minnesota who joined ISIS, an organization that chops the heads off of men.

Look to Oregon \u2014 the first state in the U.S. to legalize physician-assisted suicide \u2014 suicide rates continue to climb while funding for prevention continues to dry up; among teenagers, suicide is the second leading cause of death now,\" Hocker said.\n\n\"And we cannot be surprised: a 2015 survey published in the Southern Medical Journal found that the legalization of Physician Assisted Suicide led to a direct increase in suicides overall. Supposed 'Death with Dignity' laws are being aggressively marketed as compassionate \u2014 and as Americans, we need to realize they are anything but that.\"\n\nExpand | Collapse (Photo: The Christian Post/Brandon Showalter) Julie Hocker of the American Conservative Union and Stan Swim of the GFC Foundation speak at a breakout session on the dangers of assisted suicide at CPAC at the Gaylord National Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland, February 24, 2017.\n\nUnder the guise of \"compassion,\" society \"tosses aside the vulnerable, the frail, and the sick by creating a growing class of citizens deemed better off dead,\" she added.\n\nAs it stands, the following states have adopted assisted suicide legislation: Oregon, Washington, Vermont, California, Colorado and Washington, D.C. In Montana, a court ruling has legalized the practice there.\n\nAlthough numbers remain relatively small, the assisted suicide rate has risen dramatically since its legalization in the Netherlands in 2002 for the terminally ill.\n\n\"In 2016, there were 6,091 reported instances of euthanasia in the Netherlands. Of those, 141 were for patients with dementia. That is up from 12 such cases in 2009. Also for patients with chronic psychiatric illness, there were 0 instances of euthanasia in 2009, but by 2016 that number had risen to 60,\" The Federalist reported.\n\nThe D66 party is one of the smaller yet politically effective progressive Dutch parties whose leader, Alexander Pechtold, regards the right to die when one so chooses as an \"individual consideration\" and a positive advance.\n\nWhen asked to elaborate on his views on a Dutch TV show in March, Pechtold said that he favored an incremental approach to this and that his colleague, Pia Dijkstra, \"can now continue persuading parliament and the country to \u2014 in my own words and personal opinion \u2014 take the next step for our civilization.\"\n\nHe further maintained that broad political support for euthanizing completely healthy people exists and that he hopes that eventually people younger than 75 can opt to end their lives when they want, though a lower age is not feasible at the moment.\n\nSince no party ever wins a majority in the Dutch parliament, coalitions must be made in order to form a functioning government. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the center-right People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, who won re-election earlier this year, is now in negotiations with D66 and two Christian political parties, both of whom oppose the proposed \"Completed Life Bill.\" If he forms a coalition with D66, the Completed Life bill will likely be placed on the legislative agenda and it may indeed pass.\n\nYet in recent months, some troubling developments have emerged such that even euthanasia supporters are expressing concerns publicly.\n\nThe Christian Post reported in February that a Dutch doctor was cleared of wrongdoing after administering lethal drugs to an 80-year-old woman suffering from dementia who had reportedly expressed second thoughts about wanting to die. The process included putting a sedative in her coffee unbeknownst to her and when she was injected with the drugs to kill her the doctor ordered her family members to hold her down in order to complete the procedure because her body began resisting death.\n\nThis incident led some who endorse the practice to admit how things have gone awry.\n\nIn February, a group of 220 doctors took out an ad in Dutch newspaper NRC to voice their refusal to administer euthanasia drugs to patients suffering from advanced dementia since such people cannot verbally consent to it. In a detailed editorial in NRC in June, Boudewijn Chabot, a psychogeriatrician who supports assisted suicide, said that the practice of euthanasia \"is out of control\" and cited the gradual erosion of key legal constraints over time.\n\n\"I do not see how we get the genie back into the bottle.

If no agreement is made, the baby would be transferred to a hospice where his ventilation tube would be removed.\n\nThe 11-month-old baby, who suffers from an extremely rare genetic condition causing progressive brain damage and muscle weakness, has been the subject of a bitter dispute between his parents and Great Ormond Street Hospital in London.\n\nThe case has triggered a heated international debate in the press and on social media about who should decide a child's fate, and has drawn comment from U.S. President Donald Trump and Pope Francis.\n\nHaving reluctantly taken the decision over the weekend to let Charlie die, his parents have been making desperate attempts to make an arrangement that would make it possible for them to spend several days with him, away from the hospital.\n\nCharlie requires invasive ventilation to breathe and cannot see, hear or swallow.\n\nAt stake in this final, agonizing part of the legal dispute is how long Connie Yates and Chris Gard will have with their son before he dies.\n\nThe parents tried for several days to gain permission to take their son home, but as Wednesday's court hearing progressed it became clear that would not happen because the logistical problems were insurmountable.\n\nThe parents had made clear that if they could not take Charlie home, they would prefer him to die in a hospice rather than in the hospital, where he has spent most of his life.\n\nBut a lawyer for Charlie's court-appointed guardian told the court that no hospice could provide care for intensively ventilated children for a long time, so the parents' wish to spend several days with him could not be fulfilled.\n\nThe parents have been trying to find a doctor willing to oversee a plan that would allow Charlie to be ventilated in a hospice for several days. It was to give them a final chance of making such an arrangement that the judge gave them until noon on Thursday.\n\n\"Unless by 12 noon tomorrow the parents and the guardian and the hospital can agree an alternative arrangement, Charlie will be transferred to a hospice and extubated shortly after,\" said Nicholas Francis, the judge presiding over the case.\n\nMother in Tears\n\nAn alternative arrangement appears unlikely, given the total breakdown in relations between the parents and the hospital.\n\nThe judge ordered that the name of the hospice and the exact timing of Charlie's last moments should not be disclosed to the public.\n\nAt one point, Yates shouted in court, apparently at Charlie's guardian: \"What if it was your child? I hope you are happy with yourself.\" She then left the courtroom in tears.\n\nAt the start of the hearing, the parents' lawyer, Grant Armstrong, had said they had found a doctor who could help them.\n\nBut the guardian's lawyer, Victoria Butler-Cole, later said the person in question was a general medical doctor with no experience of intensive care, and that he had not identified any hospice willing to undertake intensive care for a long period.\n\nButler-Cole said the parents should spend the last few days of Charlie's life with him, not with their lawyers.\n\nThe dispute first made headlines months ago, when Charlie's parents wanted to take him to the United States to undergo experimental treatment.\n\nThe Great Ormond Street doctors said it would not help and would only prolong the baby's suffering. British courts, backed by the European Court of Human Rights, refused permission, saying the parents' plan was not in Charlie's best interests.\n\nThe parents gave up the legal battle on Monday, saying that the latest scans showed Charlie's condition had deteriorated to the point that no recovery was possible. But they remain convinced that the treatment might have helped Charlie had he received it months ago.\n\nThe hospital disagrees. It says Charlie had suffered irreversible brain damage by January as a result of a series of seizures, and his responsiveness has not changed since then.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/charlie-gard-has-died-hospice-experimental-treatment-denied-life-support-removed-193594/"}

But like the child he appears to be, his words and actions can simply arise from a person who is not intelligent enough to do the job he has been elected to do\n\nJustin Trudeau: Maybe he is just really, really stupid\n\n\n\nMost Canadians who do not spend their evenings drinking the Liberal Party Kool Aid do not like the way Justin Trudeau is running the country. They realize as leaders and politicians go, he is not the sharpest knife in the drawer. But it is possible even these people are actually overestimating his intelligence. As far as his mental abilities are concerned, he is probably a lot worse than most of us think he is.\n\n\n\nIn a Toronto Sun column, Lorne Gunter wrote everything Trudeau does is done because he is \u201cna\u00efve.\u201d The major problem with the columnist\u2019s thinking is he is being too kind to the selfie-taking Sock Boy. As far as naivet\u00e9 goes, Trudeau is looking at it in the rear view mirror. The reality is he is simply not bright enough to hold any job requiring more intelligence than his work experience before entering politics required; part time drama teacher, snowboard instructor and bouncer.\n\nTrudeau is just so bereft of functioning brain cells, he is unable to appreciate the consequences of his words and actions It could very well be many Canadians are overestimating the prime minister\u2019s intelligence. This is opposite the way critics of other leaders have them figured out. Usually their political enemies underestimate the intelligence of these leaders. Jean Chr\u00e9tien is a case in point. Love him or hate him, the former PM is an extremely bright man with exceptional political smarts. During his 40 years in politics he successfully conveyed his \u201clittle guy from Shawinigan\u201d persona; an ordinary country bumpkin not as smart as the average Canadian.\n\n\n\nAnd then there is Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne. After raising the province\u2019s minimum wage from $11.60 an hour to a whopping $14 per hour, it was said of the premier she does not understand how business works. Unlike the Right Honourable Prime Minister of Canada, she is perfectly capable of understanding basic economics. If costs rise, businesses will take steps to increase their revenues or decrease their costs. To say Wynne is incapable of understanding this is an insult to the premier which is unfortunate because there are so many better things to insult her for if someone has a mind to. The reality is she does understand the damage she is doing to the economy; she just doesn\u2019t care. It is all about power and there are more Ontarians making minimum or near-minimum wages than there are people employing these workers. Higher wages, more votes. Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely and the potential loss of power corrupts even more.\n\n\n\nTrudeau on the other hand may not be evil and setting out to intentionally destroy Canada as Barack Obama did to the U.S. during his eight years as president. Trudeau is just so bereft of functioning brain cells, he is unable to appreciate the consequences of his words and actions.\n\nProof of his mental incompetency As proof of his mental incompetency one only has to look at some of the things he has said over the years. \u201cThe budget will balance itself\u201d and \u201cWe have to rethink elements as basic as time and space.\u201d The first statement is ludicrous on its face and the second one makes no sense. If he misspoke while uttering these inanities he never told us. And if he was somehow trying to be funny he never told us that either. He lacks the minimal intelligence to realize a statement made by a prime minister is different than one made by an ordinary person in a bar. Words matter and it is scary to realize how mentally incompetent Canada\u2019s PM is.\n\n\n\nAs for his policies, there is a good chance he is not a Muslim nor a radical Islamist terrorist sympathizer many of his political enemies portray him to be. He is simply not smart enough to comprehend the danger of terrorism. He actually believes hardened terrorists who return to Canada can be rehabilitated and become model citizens if only they are given enough hugs. While he is capable of seeing what some of these terrorists do, he is mentally incapable of actually believing and appreciating such actions.\n\n\n\nAs regarding his $10.5 million payout of other peoples\u2019 money to Omar Khadr he actually believes he had no choice but to pay it. He is unable to understand that while the Supreme Court of Canada ruled the little Terror Tyke\u2019s rights had been violated, the matter should have been publicly tried. Trudeau was never \u201cforced\u201d to pay the $10.5 million although the prime minister cannot see the distinction.\n\n", "domain": "canadafreepress.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://canadafreepress.com/print_friendly/justin-trudeau-maybe-he-is-just-really-really-stupid"}

This is why President Harry Truman asked for a one-armed economist because he was tired of being told \u201con the one hand\u2026, but on the other hand\u2026\u201d But it is basic Economics 101 that if a business\u2019s costs increase, that business will end up raising its prices.\n\n\n\nOn Jan. 1, 2018, Ontario\u2019s minimum wage increased from $11.60 an hour to $14 an hour, an increase of 21 percent. And this percentage does not include related increases employers must pay for contribution to their employees\u2019 costs for Employment Insurance and the Canada Pension Plan. Also not included in the increase are other wage hikes employers will have to give their workers who made more than $11.60 an hour at the end of 2017 but less than the now minimum wage. This large increase is a disaster for the province.\n\nJan 9, 2018 \u2014 Arthur Weinreb\n\n\n\nNo matter how destructive you think Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne\u2019s idea was to increase the province\u2019s minimum wage law a whopping amount, a couple of Tim Hortons\u2019 franchisees and the franchisor played it wrong. In the end, with the help of the business-hating media, Wynne has emerged the winner in the battle over whether the increase in the minimum wage is good or bad.\n\n\n\nOntario\u2019s Fair Workplaces, Better Jobs Act, 2017, took effect on Jan. 1 (You know a law can\u2019t be good when it contains the word \u201cfair.\u201d) Among its provisions, the provinces minimum wage increased from $1l.60 an hour to $14. Under the legislation the minimum wage is set to increase again to $15 an hour in January 2019. Although businesses should and do expect minimum wages to increase as other prices do, the 2018 increase represents a 23% increase in low wage levels. As employers have to contribute to the employees Canada pension and Employment insurance payments, the cost to these employers will be more than just the $2.40 increase in the hourly wage.\n\n\n\nOct 12, 2017 \u2014 Arthur Weinreb\n\nOn Oct. 1, Jagmeet Singh won the leadership of the third party New Democratic Party on the first ballot. Singh\u2019s election should have Justin Trudeau very very worried. Singh is everything Trudeau loves but can never be.\n\n\n\nTo begin with, Singh is a Sikh which means he is not white. And as we know Trudeau hates whites. He loathes the white race even though he is a member and he has never made a secret of that fact. The Little Potato especially hates the old stock Canadians; he even said as much. The man who is the highest elected official in this once great country said he prefers immigrants to Canadians who were born in Canada. This is because immigrants choose to come here. Okay, Singh is not an immigrant having been born in the subway-deprived Toronto area of Scarborough. But as we know, perception is reality in politics and Singh looks like an immigrant. Justin never can.\n\nSep 28, 2017 \u2014 Arthur Weinreb\n\nA poll was taken on Monday, the day after the numerous protests by NFL players during the Sunday games. The survey of Western New Yorkers was conducted by the Buffalo-based Big Daddy Strategies in conjunction with Remington Research Group. As the poll was conducted only in Western New York, the questions and answers pertained to the Buffalo Bills.\n\n\n\nA total of 1,390 adults who are likely to vote in general elections were polled. Of these 1,390 people, 71 percent of respondents disagreed with players kneeling or otherwise protesting while the national anthem is being played. These respondents agreed there were other times players can protest other than during the playing of the anthem. Only 23 percent agreed the timing of player protests was acceptable.\n\nSep 25, 2017 \u2014 Arthur Weinreb\n\nRemember Omar Khadr? The little Terror Tyke. A proud member of Canada\u2019s First Family of Terrorism, Khadr was in Afghanistan in 2002 working in the family business of jihad when he killed U.S. Army medic Christopher Speer and wounded Sgt Layne Morris, blinding him in one eye. The darling of the left ended up in Guantanamo Bay and pleaded guilty to terrorism charges before an American tribunal.\n\nKhadr sued the Canadian government demanding he be repatriated back to Canada. In 2010, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled Khadr\u2019s rights had been violated under the Charter because he was subjected to such things as sleep deprivation and Canadian officials who interviewed him in Guantanamo Bay were partly responsible for this breach. Although Canada\u2019s top court found his Charter rights were breached, the justices refused to force the government to repatriate him. Although Khadr was entitled to a remedy the top court was silent on what that remedy should be. After this decision, the Harper government did arrange for the little terrorist to be brought back to Canada.\n\nSep 20, 2017 \u2014 Arthur Weinreb\n\nA poll was conducted last month by Leger on behalf of the Ontario Science Centre. Respondents were asked whether scientific findings were matters of fact or of opinion. Of those polled, 43 percent of those asked answered scientific findings were a matter of opinion. (Global News, Sept. 18)\n\n\n\nRespondents were asked to describe themselves; whether they based their beliefs on intuition (or gut feelings) or whether they were analytical. Those who said they were analytical were more likely to say scientific findings were based upon objective facts.\n\nAug 29, 2017 \u2014 Arthur Weinreb\n\nCPC leader Andrew Scheer has been relatively quiet this summer causing criticism from some conservatives. It seems the newly elected leader preferred to do the barbeque circuit rather than speak out against serious issues facing Canada such as the $10.5 million payment to terrorist Omar Khadr and the erasure by the Trudeau government of the country\u2019s southern border.\n\n\n\nIt is true Scheer made some comments about these matters but left the bulk of the border crisis to Michelle Rempel, the party\u2019s immigration critic. Rempel\u2019s solution was to simply spend more and more money to hire more immigration officers and Immigration and Refugee board judges and support staff in order to process these illegal border crossers more quickly. The faster they can be processed, the sooner they can be deported back to their countries of origin. Rempel\u2019s solution to simply throw more money at the problem was truly Trudashian.\n\nAug 26, 2017 \u2014 Arthur Weinreb\n\nAs everyone who has been at least semi-conscious in the past few days knows, ESPN pulled Asian American Robert Lee from covering the opening college football game between the University of Virginia and William and Mary. The reason Lee was replaced was because his name is the same as Confederate General Robert E. Lee. The network, now being referred to in some circles as MSESPN, was afraaaaiiiiiid memes might appear on social media about Robert Lee marching into Charlottesville. As well, given the current climate we all know anyone named Robert Lee will bring horror to the multitude of little snowflakes currently found in the United States.\n\nAug 22, 2017 \u2014 Arthur Weinreb\n\nSo many illegals have been walking into Canada lately, even Justin Trudeau is starting to worry. Yesterday Trudeau said if he could talk to \u201casylum seekers,\u201d he would tell them, there is no advantage to just walking into Canada. He added those seeking refugee status will be subjected to a \u201crigorous screening process\u201d and \u201cour rules, our principles and our laws apply to everyone.\u201d Cue the laughter. (CBC, Aug. 20, 2017)\n\nDuring the first two weeks of August, 3,800 people were apprehended by the RCMP walking into Quebec. This does not include those who were caught walking to other provinces or those who managed to enter the country without being caught by the authorities. And there is no indication these numbers are about to decrease anytime soon.\n\nAug 14, 2017 \u2014 Arthur Weinreb\n\nPresident Donald Trump has said a lot of complimentary things about Canada\u2019s prime minister. Gushing over Justin Trudeau at the recent G20 meeting, Trump said, \u201cWe have a great neighbour in Canada and Justin is doing a spectacular job in Canada. Everybody loves him and they love him for a reason so congratulations on the job you\u2019re doing.\u201d (National Post, July 8, 2017)\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s statement, and other similar utterances surprised a lot of people. Trudeau, like President Obama, is engaged in a fundamental transformation of Canada. One of the differences is Trudeau is proceeding at a pace much faster than Obama did during his eight years in office. Trudeau even specifically said Canada is the world\u2019s \u201cfirst post-national state\u201d with no core identity and no mainstream. Not only is he destroying the country but he brags about it. The U.S. president is the polar opposite. He won the election by rejecting the globalization trend and making it clear his main concern was for the United States.\n\nAug 10, 2017 \u2014 Arthur Weinreb\n\nLast week, the Canadian government released statistics on the number of illegal immigrants crossing into Canada from the United States at points other than official ports of entry. These numbers include only those who were intercepted by the RCMP while illegally entering the country. It has been estimated hundreds of illegals are walking into Canada every day.\n\nIn June, the last month these statistics are available, 884 illegal border crossers were arrested coming into Canada. A whopping 781 of these \u201casylum seekers\u201d crossed into Quebec. The resources available to house, feed and process these \u201crefugees\u201d are strained with some of them having to be housed in Montreal\u2019s Olympic Stadium.\n\nJul 24, 2017 \u2014 Arthur Weinreb\n\nThe Canadian Press has obtained a copy of a draft citizenship guide the Liberals are working on. These guides are used by people studying to pass their citizenship test. The last time the guide was updated was in 2011 under the Harper government. While some of the changes to the guide were expected based upon Trudeau\u2019s criticism of the Tories\u2019 guide, others were totally unexpected.\n\nWhen former Immigration Minister Jason Kenney released the 2011 guide, the booklet stated \u201cbarbaric cultural practices\u201d such as honour killings and female genital mutilation were criminal offences in Canada and not wanted. Trudeau had his knickers, no doubt halal knickers to match his socks, in a knot over the use of the term \u201cbarbaric.\u201d The Little Potato obviously found little if anything wrong with immigrants who kill their family members as a matter of honour or who practise female genital mutilation. These acts apparently paled in comparison to Harper\u2019s use of the word \u201cbarbaric.\u201d\n\nJul 22, 2017 \u2014 Arthur Weinreb\n\nIf he did, it would not be the first time.\n\nChristina Benson was a civilian employee of the Ottawa Police Service and her job was to conduct background checks on those applying to become police officers with the Ottawa police. Last summer she conducted checks on 19 new recruits. Benson found 18 of the 19 applicants passed the check while one failed. She forwarded her findings to Charles Bordeleau, Chief of the Ottawa police. The chief has the final say on who gets hired and who does not. The man Benson determined not to have passed her background check was a Somali.\n\nOn July 24, 2016, Abdirahman Abdi, a 37-year-old Somali Canadian, became involved in a confrontation with Ottawa police after officers received information about a groping. During this confrontation, Abdi suffered a medical episode and died in hospital the next day. There was outrage as there always is when a black suspect dies at the hands of police.\n\nJul 15, 2017 \u2014 Arthur Weinreb\n\nThe $10.5 million payment made by the Trudeau government to terror tyke Omar Khadr handed Andrew Scheer and the CPC party a great issue to defeat the Liberals in the next election. But Scheer is going to have to do better than he is now doing if he hopes to capitalize on the gift he has been given.\n\nHours before Americans began their July 4th celebrations, news was leaked the government intended to pay the $10.5 million to the most prominent member of Canada\u2019s First Family of Terrorism. Two days later, it was revealed the money had already been paid, no doubt to prevent the funds from being seized by Tabitha Speer and Layne Morris. Speer\u2019s husband Christopher, an American medic was killed when Khadr threw a grenade at him in Afghanistan in 2002. Former Sgt. Layne Morris was blinded in one eye.\n\nJul 5, 2017 \u2014 Arthur Weinreb\n\nNot only is Kathleen Wynne unpopular in the province she governs but she has the lowest approval ratings of any premier in Canada. In a poll late last month, while 70 percent of Ontarians disapprove of her performance, almost half of all Canadians (48 percent) disapprove of her job performance.\n\nBack in March, an Angus Reid poll gave her a record low; only 12 percent of Ontarians polled approved of Wynne\u2019s performance. As the late Finance Minister Jim Flaherty might have put it, she reached Elvis territory; the percentage of people who like the job she is doing is about the same as those who think the singer is still alive.\n\nWatching her majority government headed for what could be third party status after the next election scheduled for June next year, Wynne took action. In May, Wynne announced the province\u2019s minimum wage, now at $11.40 an hour, will increase to $15 by 2019. As of Jan.1 next year, the minimum wage will be increased to $14 an hour. Under the premier\u2019s plan, the minimum wage will increase by a whopping 32 percent in less than two years. Other measures announced such as workers being paid for three hours if their shifts are cancelled and workers being entitled to 10 days of personal leave (two of them paid leave) have been announced.\n\nJun 5, 2017 \u2014 Arthur Weinreb\n\nBecause you\u2019re a comedian does not mean everything you say or do is a joke\n\nAlthough I have not been writing much lately, I have written thousands of articles for Canada Free Press and its hard copy predecessor, Toronto Free Press, during the last 20 plus years. Although I have occasionally thrown in an \u201cI,\u201d I have always avoided writing in the first person.\n\nExpressing an opinion by inserting something like \u201cI think\u201d gives the reader the opportunity to say \u201cWho cares what he thinks?\u201d And besides, I\u2019m not all that interesting. But on this occasion, there is no other way to do it.\n\nMay 4, 2017 \u2014 Arthur Weinreb\n\nIn the past few days there have been calls for Harjit Sajjan to resign his cabinet post as the Minister of Defense. While it is certainly possible he might resign if he personally cannot take the heat, or if Justin Trudeau believes it is politically expedient to get rid of him, there is no way he will ever resign as a matter of honour.\n\nMar 22, 2017 \u2014 Arthur Weinreb\n\nSince the end of last year, the number of people crossing illegally from the United States to Canada has increased. The increase has been attributed to Donald Trump\u2019s election as president with the promised crackdown of illegal immigrants in the United States.\n\nWhile the numbers are not yet large, they are bound to grow. While many of the current illegal border crossers are from Africa and the Middle East, Reuters reported last week, Canada has recorded a record number of detentions of Mexicans attempting to illegally enter Canada during the first two months of the year. In addition to Trump\u2019s election on Dec. 1, 2016, Justin Trudeau\u2019s government did away with the requirement of visas in order for Mexicans to visit Canada. Unless Trump does a complete policy reversal, these numbers are bound to increase. And more and more Canadians are now demanding their country\u2019s borders to be secured.\n\nMar 6, 2017 \u2014 Arthur Weinreb\n\nRecently there has been an influx of illegal immigrants walking into Canada from the United States. According to the RCMP more than 400 people have crossed the border illegally since Jan. 1; a substantial increase over the same time period last year.\n\nDespite what the practitioners of the religion of global warming say, it gets a tad chilly in the Great White (obviously racist) North. Two illegals suffered severe frostbite after walking for seven hours to reach the border. The onset of spring and summer are only going to increase these numbers.\n\nThere are a lot of misconceptions floating around about how Canada can stem the tide of illegals crossing into Canada. These misconceptions are coming from politicians, pundits and others on social media. The reality is, short of building an impenetrable wall along the entire U.S./Canada border, it is virtually impossible to stop people from illegally entering Canada.", "domain": "canadafreepress.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://canadafreepress.com/members/1/Arthur/841"}

The city of Afrin is being bombarded by Turkish airstrikes. We are asking for intervention, and protection against the violent attacks which are being levied against use at the moment.\"\n\n\"Many lives are in mortal danger,\" the letter, which was shared with The Christian Post, reads. \"We are requesting aid and assistance. We are unable to protect ourselves or our families against these attacks, neither are we able to offer assistance or shelter the innocents.\"\n\nAccording to the letter, there are more than 200 Christian families that live in the Afrin area.\n\nAfrin is an isolated part of the Syrian federation that borders areas controlled by Islamist rebels and the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nIn Afrin, evangelical Christianity had steadily grown over the past several years, according to Johannes de Jong, the director of the European Christian think tank Sallux who has worked with Syriac Christians since the rise of the Islamic State in 2014.\n\n\"[I]t is only since the beginning of the civil war that these churches started to grow. This was also possible as the Federation of Northern Syria realized full freedom of religion which allowed the public establishment of churches and missionary work,\" de Jong told CP on Tuesday. \"[Ninety-five percent] of the believers have a Muslim background so almost all church members are converts to Christianity. There are at least three Christian congregations in the various parts of Afrin. The largest congregation consists of approximately 200 families.\"\n\nTurkey began its attack on the area last week on the grounds that the People's Protection Units, the Kurdish militia in Syria also known as YPG, is a terrorist group that threatens the NATO country's security.\n\nDe Jong, however, points out that YPG is part of the Syrian Democratic Forces that worked with the United States-led fight against the Islamic State.\n\n\"What we are hearing from these Kurdish churches in Afrin is that they have to sleep in basements out of fear of bombings,\" de Jong said. \"Some are hiding in the mountains. I am getting quite terrible pictures. It is clearly a threat to the freedom of these Christian communities. The existence of these Christian communities is really under threat. As Christians, they simply know what will be coming for them if these al Qaeda-type of militias take over the area.\"\n\nDe Jong expressed concern that terrorist outfits such as the al Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front are involved in the Turkish attack on Afrin.\n\n\"The Turkish outlet 'Cumhuriyet Gazetesi' published these pictures of the Turkish allies in the Afrin operation. Thanks to that we now have evidence that al-Qaeda is part of the Turkish-backed militias that are part of the invasion in Afrin,\" de Jong explained in an email. \"The intention of these pictures is to show the Turkish allies. The man [in photo No. 21 on the website] wears a [bandana] of Al Nusra. [It is] undisputed is that al-Nusra is al-Qaeda in Syria. It is unbelievable that such a threat is supported by anyone at all.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis urged Turkey to use restraint in its operations in Syria.\n\n\"This could be exploited by ISIS and al-Qaeda, obviously, that we're not staying focused on them right now. And obviously it risks exacerbating the humanitarian crisis that most of Syria is going through,\" Mattis told reporters during his trip to Indonesia.\n\nMattis' comment comes after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Monday that \"We recognize and fully appreciate Turkey's legitimate right to protect its own citizens from terrorist elements.\n\nDe Jong criticized Tillerson's remark and called on American Christians to stand up and urge the U.S. government to take action to stop the Turkish operation in Afrin.\n\n\"We hear Rex Tillerson speaking about Kurdish concerns for their security. Turks are at the same moment using al-Qaeda militias to attack Afrin and these Kurdish Christians are literally crying out for help. What is this?\" de Jong asked. \"What needs to happen now is that U.S. Christians need to stand up and tell the Trump administration that this needs to stop immediately. There is no right to bomb a civilian population. There is no right in any NATO treaty or whatever to indiscriminately bomb civilians.\"\n\n\"These guys have already said there is no place for Christians. These Kurdish Christians, you can see it in the statements that they make, they know that these jihadists are the real threat for them,\" de Jong continued. \"This is happening right now and the U.S. is allowing it to happen.\"\n\nDe Jong asserted that if the U.S. wanted to, it could have a military presence in Afrin.\n\n\"There is no problem any more to go to Afrin. First of all, the Russians pulled back. That means that airspace is open. The second point is that U.S. forces have already been between the rest of the federation and Afrin. If they can be there once, they can be there again. Russia will not object. Turkey will not really be able to object because they can't directly attack the U.S. and the U.S. could say if they want that they are going after these al-Qaeda guys that are hiding in these areas. Obviously, they will be able to stop the attack in Afrin.\"", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/christian-churches-under-attack-amid-turkeys-bombardment-syrian-region-214838/"}

It is natural and most people feel it at least at some point in their lives.\n\nThere is when you really think about it an evolutionary reason as to why we are afraid of the dark. While most people think being afraid of the dark is childish it is anything but. Researchers have hypothesized that this fear in itself stems from a point in history when we were not the top predators. We often fear the unknown and in the dark, there comes a lot of unknown.\n\nWe were also raised seeing monsters and hearing stories of scary things hiding in the dark. Even most \u2018religious\u2019 cultures associate evil with \u2018darkness.\u2019 It is also a pretty conditioned fear for most. With that being said, we should not be afraid of the dark. There is a lot we can learn from the dark and if nothing else we should respect it and find it to be peaceful, to say the least.\n\n5 Reasons Why You Should Not Be Afraid of The Dark:\n\n1. There is balance in darkness.\n\nIn darkness, we can find parts of ourselves we didn\u2019t realize existed. While this may sound pretty cheesy to some if you have ever spent time reflecting in the dark you know this to be true. There is a lot of peace in the silence that comes with it.\n\n2. In the darkness, we can calm our minds.\n\nIn the dark, we are able to let our minds relax. I find meditating in the dark before bed to be quite soothing. Nothing is more relaxing to me than being alone in the dark, as weird as that may sound.\n\n3. Darkness allows us to visualize things more clearly.\n\nIn the dark we can visualize on a level we would not be able to in the light. We don\u2019t even have to close our eyes to see things we want to see. While this takes some practice it is quite interesting, to say the least. I mean even when you close your eyes you are in the dark, it is unavoidable.\n\n4. Without darkness, we would not appreciate the light.\n\nIf we never had any darkness no one would appreciate what the beauty of light is. If the sun was seen 24/7 all over the planet would you really be happier? I know I wouldn\u2019t be. I need the darkness and of course, we need it as well.\n\n5. Darkness symbolizes endless possibilities.\n\nDarkness is symbolic of a lot of things, but something that really touches base with me is that in a lot of religious or theories, darkness was what came first. There was nothing but darkness and now there is so much more than that. From darkness, anything can happen.\n\nDo you value the dark as much as you should?

Don\u2019t read on if you are easily scared and hoping to get some sleep tonight!\n\nThe Smiling Man\n\n\u201cAbout five years ago I lived downtown in a major city in the US. I\u2019ve always been a night person, so I would often find myself bored after my roommate, who was decidedly not a night person, went to sleep. To pass the time, I used to go for long walks and spend the time thinking.\n\nI spent four years like that, walking alone at night, and never once had a reason to feel afraid. I always used to joke with my roommate that even the drug dealers in the city were polite. But all of that changed in just a few minutes of one evening.\n\nIt was a Wednesday, somewhere between one and two in the morning, and I was walking near a police patrolled park quite a ways from my apartment. It was a quiet night, even for a week night, with very little traffic and almost no one on foot. The park, as it was most nights, was completely empty.\n\nI turned down a short side street in order to loop back to my apartment when I first noticed him. At the far end of the street, on my side, was the silhouette of a man, dancing. It was a strange dance, similar to a waltz, but he finished each \u201cbox\u201d with an odd forward stride. I guess you could say he was dance-walking, headed straight for me.\n\nDeciding he was probably drunk, I stepped as close as I could to the road to give him the majority of the sidewalk to pass me by. The closer he got, the more I realized how gracefully he was moving. He was very tall and lanky, and wearing an old suit. He danced closer still, until I could make out his face. His eyes were open wide and wild, head tilted back slightly, looking off at the sky. His mouth was formed in a painfully wide cartoon of a smile. Between the eyes and the smile, I decided to cross the street before he danced any closer.\n\nI took my eyes off of him to cross the empty street. As I reached the other side, I glanced back\u2026 and then stopped dead in my tracks. He had stopped dancing and was standing with one foot in the street, perfectly parallel to me. He was facing me but still looking skyward. Smile still wide on his lips.\n\nI was completely and utterly unnerved by this. I started walking again, but kept my eyes on the man. He didn\u2019t move. Once I had put about half a block between us, I turned away from him for a moment to watch the sidewalk in front of me. The street and sidewalk ahead of me were completely empty. Still unnerved, I looked back to where he had been standing to find him gone. For the briefest of moments, I felt relieved, until I noticed him. He had crossed the street, and was now slightly crouched down. I couldn\u2019t tell for sure due to the distance and the shadows, but I was certain he was facing me. I had looked away from him for no more than 10 seconds, so it was clear that he had moved fast.\n\nI was so shocked that I stood there for some time, staring at him. And then he started moving toward me again. He took giant, exaggerated tip toed steps, as if he were a cartoon character sneaking up on someone. Except he was moving very, very quickly.\n\nI\u2019d like to say at this point I ran away or pulled out my pepper spray or my cellphone or anything at all, but I didn\u2019t. I just stood there, completely frozen as the smiling man crept toward me.\n\nAnd then he stopped again, about a car length away from me. Still smiling his smile, still looking to the sky.\n\nWhen I finally found my voice, I blurted out the first thing that came to mind. What I meant to ask was, \u201cWhat the fuck do you want?!\u201d in an angry, commanding tone. What came out was a whimper, \u201cWhat the fuu\u2026?\u201d\n\nRegardless of whether or not humans can smell fear, they can certainly hear it. I heard it in my own voice, and that only made me more afraid. But he didn\u2019t react to it at all. He just stood there, smiling.\n\nAnd then, after what felt like forever, he turned around, very slowly, and started dance-walking away. Just like that. Not wanting to turn my back to him again, I just watched him go, until he was far enough away to almost be out of sight. And then I realized something. He wasn\u2019t moving away anymore, nor was he dancing. I watched in horror as the distant shape of him grew larger and larger. He was coming back my way. And this time he was running.\n\nI ran too.\n\nI ran until I was off of the side road and back onto a better lit road with sparse traffic. Looking behind me then, he was nowhere to be found. The rest of the way home, I kept glancing over my shoulder, always expecting to see his stupid smile, but he was never there.\n\nI lived in that city for six months after that night, and I never went out for another walk. There was something about his face that always haunted me. He didn\u2019t look drunk, he didn\u2019t look high. He looked completely and utterly insane. And that\u2019s a very, very scary thing to see.\u201d", "domain": "awarenessact.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://awarenessact.com/this-frightening-story-will-make-you-think-twice-about-walking-alone-at-night/"}

As I tried to deal with the night\u2019s stress, I resorted to intense cooking (at least for my own standards), as well as observing reactions on social media. Many of my friends on both sides of the border were concerned with the fostering of a hateful environment based on open prejudice, intolerance and bigotry.\n\nAs I dealt with my feelings and emotions the best I could, one of my kids was concerned about my reaction, and how I should be much more upset with the election\u2019s outcome and what might transpire in the future. I tried to reassure both of my kids that in the end, somehow, sometime, everything was going to be fine because our human horizon, as broken as it is, exists within a Divine horizon.\n\nI must confess that I was also a little surprised with my own reaction. Later I realized that perhaps my equanimity was based on previous experiences. Of course I was mindful of the importance of this election regarding gender issues, but I have to admit that due to my dual citizenship this was not the first time that I had voted for a woman for president.\n\nI have to admit, too, that for some people, it felt like the end of the world due to fears of a rise in intolerant, inhuman attitudes and behaviors. I have already experienced some of that, too. In the 1980s, I went on a solidarity journey to the countryside of El Salvador in the middle of their civil war. In 2010, my Christian delegation was constantly followed by the police in Egypt\u2019s countryside, and I was told to be very careful while speaking at a Christian women\u2019s leadership conference due to governmental observers that might be hiding in the crowd (speakers from similar Christian events had been taken to prison). Of course, I have also experienced the constant fear produced by the increase of violence in northern Mexico during the last decade.\n\nAmong the many post election fears, one especially caught my attention: the one of families raising bicultural kids. This group involves different categories: families where at least one of the parents is an immigrant; families formed by interracial parents; families who have adopted children from a different race or country than their own; families that have lived in the United States for generations but have kept the traditions of their original culture/country, and thus are raising kids with diverse cultural expressions. These families share a common fear related to how an increased racism may negatively affect their kids\u2019 development and potential.\n\nBy no means do I consider myself an expert on this topic. However, I can claim some experience as an immigrant mother who has raised two wonderful children who so far, and thanks to God, seem to be doing fine. Here are some things to consider for those who find themselves in these categories, as well as those who support these blended families.\n\nIt is very important to create a good sense of awareness in bicultural kids. The sooner they realize that they are different because they have a different experience, the better. This realization includes the acknowledgement that they live in between spaces. Mexican-American theologian Virgilio Elizondo expressed his pain of not being fully accepted as a Mexican or an American, and how eventually he found a gift in knowing and embracing the two cultures, and serving as a bridge between the two parent cultures. Predominant systems may use this duality as a way to disempower someone. However, to counterattack this disempowerment, I have always taught my kids that it is a gift, and actually much fun, to know two cultures, two languages, and two ways of life. Here it is very important, too, to expose bicultural kids as much as possible to the original, foreign culture, so that they may develop a good cultural self-esteem. At a certain point we attended two San Antonio, Texas, churches: One Anglo, progressive church, on Sunday morning in order to gain knowledge of gender issues, and one Hispanic on Sunday evening, in order to learn about cultural issues. If it is safe and feasible, take these kids to their country of origin to experience directly the culture and way of life.\n\nThe Bible is a great resource for raising empowered bicultural kids. Genesis 1:26-27 highlights how all human beings are created in God\u2019s image. Even though predominant systems may overtly or covertly suggest that some people are the \u201cother\u201d who may be perceived as inferior or deficient, God does not see us in that way. Humans\u2019 dignity and worth are based on the fact that God created us in God\u2019s image, all equal, but at the same time diverse. Furthermore, the Bible highlights that we were carefully made by God (Psalm 139:13-18). The Bible narrates, too, the divine mission of people who lived in between cultures, such as Abraham, Joseph, Moses, Ruth, Esther and Paul.\n\nRacism and its evils are not pleasant topics; nonetheless they must be discussed as soon as possible. Racist dynamics are an attempt to have power over the \u201cother\u201d that is different in order to weaken and control him/her. They may be present in different ways. My daughter has experienced some racism from Latinos/as in this country due to her fair skin and blue eyes. Unfortunately, often she is told that she does not belong among the Latino/a population due to her complexion, even though she was born in Mexico, has dual citizenship, and is fluent in Spanish. Learning to recognize, name and confront these racist dynamics is truly empowering for bicultural kids.\n\nIt is also important to provide bicultural kids with safe spaces where they can express their fears, anguish and struggles. By doing this, they can verbalize their feelings/emotions and will be able to process and manage them better.\n\nI believe that parents are the major generators of self-esteem in a child. The same applies to authority figures, such as pastors, youth leaders and teachers. Let us use every opportunity to bless these kids with words of affirmation, empowerment and inclusion. At the end, the goal is to make them feel comfortable with whom they are, and help them to develop a good self-esteem.\n\nI am writing this column 20 days after the presidential election, and unfortunately there has been an increase in racist incidents in the U.S. Thus I feel that this topic is more relevant than ever. At the same time, I am mindful, too, that I am writing at the beginning of the Advent season during the week of hope. As we acknowledge the evils of racism and other \u201cisms,\u201d we, as Christians, must continue hoping that love, justice and peace will eventually prevail. I keep repeating to myself, as I told my kids during the election night, that the human horizon with all of its chaos exists within the Divine horizon. As Christians, we are called to move the human horizon as close as we can to align it with the Divine horizon. It is a challenging task, but with God\u2019s help, we must do whatever is in our hands to make this a reality in our circles of influence and beyond.", "domain": "baptistnews.com", "label": 0, "url": "https://baptistnews.com/article/post-election-thoughts-and-raising-bicultural-children-fears-challenges-and-opportunities/"}

Others directly told the radicals: \"If you want to kill us, then kill us. There are no Christians here.\"\n\nTwo people still lost their lives in the attack, including one Christian man who tried to run away, and the driver of a truck behind the bus. A much larger slaughter was prevented due to the united actions of the passengers, however.\n\nChristian leaders, including His Exc. Mgr. Joseph Alexander, the bishop of Garissa, praised the Muslims.\n\n\"It is a very good thing; a concrete sign that Kenyan Muslims are against violence,\" Alexander said at the time.\n\n\"The Shabaab now know that they do not have the support of the Muslim community,\" he added. \"We hope that we continue in this direction because a year ago there was a similar attack that caused a massacre.\"\n\nThe terror group, based in Somalia, continues carrying out attacks in Kenya, with a number of violent incidents reported in 2017.\n\nThe news of \"Watu Wote's\" nomination has been greeted with praise in Kenya, with the country's Film Commission stating on Twitter:\n\n\"Truly deserved ! Congrats @Watu_Wote crew, cast and producers from all of us at Kenya Film Commission. We are proud of you.\"\n\nVoice of America reported that a German film student produced the film, with Katja Benrath directing the short as part of a graduation project at the Hamburg Media School.\n\n\"We felt very good being nominated because this is a huge achievement being nominated, for us, for Germany and for Kenya,\" Benrath said. \"It's just great.\"\n\nThe director shared her hopes that the film can open up minds.\n\n\"I think prejudices are not the right way to live, so I think maybe this movie could help to start again, to look at the next person as a human being and not as a religion you don't like or a culture you don't like,\" she said.\n\nOne of the actors, Abdulahi Ahmed, who played the role of one of the radicals, said that the film offers an important message.\n\n\"It was hard acting as a terrorist, but the thing is I really wanted to spread the message that Muslims are not allowed to kill Christians and our religion doesn't teach us to kill Christians,\" said Ahmed.\n\n\"In our Quran, we are told that our religion does not allow us to kill even an innocent ant without a reason,\" he added, referring to the Islamic holy book.\n\nWatch a trailer for \"Watu Wote\" below:", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/oscars-2018-nominated-film-is-true-story-of-muslims-risking-lives-to-save-christians-from-radicals-215108/"}

The sentencing comes after 156 women shared their testimonies of abuse at the hands of Nassar, according to CNN.\n\nBiles took to Twitter to publicly thank the judge and support the survivors involved in the Nassar case.\n\n\"To Judge Aquilina : THANK YOU, YOU ARE MY HERO & Shout out to all of the survivors for being so brave & speaking like the queens that you are while looking at that monster,\" the Olympic gymnast wrote Wednesday. \"He will no longer have the power to steal our happiness or joy. I stand with every one of you.\"\n\nWhile Nassar offered apologies to his victims in the courtroom, the judge did not believe he was sincere after the former doctor submitted a letter to the court last week where he alleged that the media was sensationalizing his story and maintained that he was a \"good doctor.\"\n\n\"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned,\" Nassar wrote.\n\nThe judge expressed her issues with the letter and spoke out against Nassar's lack of accountability.\n\n\"This letter tells me you have not yet owned what you did,\" she said. \"You still think somehow you are right, you're a doctor, that you're entitled, so you don't have to listen. That you did 'treatment.' I wouldn't send my dogs to you, sir.\"\n\nWhen revealing Nassar's sentence, the judge is quoted as saying, \"I just signed your death warrant.\"\n\n\"It is my honor and privilege to sentence you. You do not deserve to walk outside a prison ever again,\" she said. \"You have done nothing to control those urges, and anywhere you walk, destruction will occur to those most vulnerable.\"\n\nThe proceedings took place one week after Biles opened up about the sexual abuse that she overcame at the hands of Nassar.\n\n\"I've felt a bit broken and the more I try to shut off the voice in my head the louder it screams. I am not afraid to tell my story anymore,\" she tweeted. \"I too am one of the many survivors that was sexually abused by Larry Nassar. Please believe me when I say it was a lot harder to first speak those words out loud than it is now to put them on paper.\"\n\nThe gymnast went on to add, \"There are so many reasons that I have been reluctant to share my story, but I know now it is not my fault.\"\n\nAside from his sentencing on Wednesday, Nassar received a 60-year federal prison sentence in December on child pornography charges.

The report also found that 93 percent of the megachurches are being led by a white pastor and only one has a female pastor.\n\nChurch Clarity, an LGBT-affirming group that reports on and categorizes churches based on their stated policies regarding LGBT issues, released the findings last week. The report is spurring a debate about the theological stances on sexuality as well as the racial and gender diversity among pastoral leadership and congregational membership in the 100 largest churches in America, as ranked by Outreach Magazine's popular annual list. All told, these congregations represent approximately 1.1 million Christians in America.\n\nFounded last year, Church Clarity states that its mission is to \"promote clarity\" on church policies, specifically LGBTQ policies \u2014 which it considers \"critical information.\" According to the CC report, 35 percent of the megachurches clearly state their LGBT positions on their websites. For 54 percent of the megachurches, their position is \"unclear\" \u2014 meaning they're not easily found on the website and may be \"buried\" in peripheral sections such as sermons, blogposts, or media. And 11 percent have \"undisclosed\" (cannot be found on website) LGBT policies.\n\nChurch Clarity's decision to report on racial and gender issues in addition to the degree of LGBT affirmation within congregations is reportedly part of the organization's \"expanding\" mission.\n\nWriting at Religion News Service, Jonathan Merritt called the CC report \"explosive,\" noting that the \"staggering\" data that shows none of the megachurches have policies affirming same-sex people and relationships \"will doubtlessly provide firepower to conservative Christians who claim that LGBTQ+ affirmation is a slippery slope to liberalism and a congregation killer.\"\n\nOthers maintain that this is but another round of trashing megachurches that are stereotypically known for glitzy flashiness and other factors some find unappealing, but are churches that usually proclaim traditional teaching, including on issues of sexuality and sexual ethics.\n\nMark Tooley, president of the Washington-based Institute on Religion & Democracy, observed on his organization's blog Tuesday that despite CC's intention to shame these large congregations for their traditional teaching on sexuality, they are the ones that are actually growing while liberal churches that have LGBT-affirming policies aren't.\n\n\"There are thousands of churches in America with liberal clergy. They could become megachurches if their messages and appeals were compelling to more people. But they aren't,\" Tooley wrote, adding that liberal iterations of most faiths exist mainly \"in the minds of some Western theologians and sociologists.\"\n\n\"More permissive and theologically lax religion may sound appealing but it rarely attracts a sustained crowd, anywhere.\"\n\nLarge crowds do not mean theological truth is being taught, but congregations that continue to die hardly indicate spiritual health, he said.\n\nAnd while Church Clarity is also calling out megachurches for their lack of diversity in leadership, liberal mainline Protestant churches are even less racially diverse, Tooley argued.\n\nChurch Clarity lists as problematic in its report that only 7 percent of megachurches are led by people of color when racial minorities comprise nearly 40 percent of the general population. Similarly, the group laments that only one of the 100 megachurches listed has a female pastor, who co-pastors with her husband, when 8 percent of Fortune 100 CEOs are women.\n\n\"In a country/world where roughly 50% of the population is female, let's not get too excited about Fortune's 8% stat,\" CC notes. \"The point is to compare for-profit corporations vs churches.\"\n\nYet Tooley pointed out that while megachurches originated in mostly white exurbs and suburbs and are often founded by entrepreneurial pastors, \"their congregations are more diverse than commonly imagined.\"\n\nA study from the Leadership Network and Hartford Institute in 2015 revealed that 10 percent of megachurches reported no racial majority, and 37 percent of megachurches have between 20 and 49 percent racial minorities attending congregations that are majority white.\n\nThe IRD president also posited that even though the average megachurch does not affirm LGBT causes, \"still by virtue of its size and variety of programs has more LGBTQ people than the average mostly empty liberal church proudly waving rainbow flags to little effect.\"\n\nSuch is also the case regarding racial diversity among the supposedly inclusive theologically liberal churches. With the exception of the least liberal American Baptist denomination, Tooley said, the memberships of liberal mainline Protestant congregations range from 88 percent to 96 percent white.\n\n\"Their memberships are also much older,\" he continued. \"One survey says only 12 percent of Episcopal Church members are millennials. Likely far fewer are active worshipers. One survey says the average age of a megachurch worshiper is 40. For Mainline Protestants it's close to 60.\"\n\nHe further pointed out that as for female clergy, some denominations like his own United Methodist Church have ordained women for many decades, even though the vast majority of Christians worldwide do not.\n\n\"Although I'm happy in my tradition, I'm loathe to condemn as intrinsically bigoted the vast majority with different teachings. If megachurches are chauvinistic and bigoted why do they more successfully attract women and non-whites than the ostensibly more enlightened liberal churches?\" he asked.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/100-largest-us-megachurches-do-not-affirm-lgbt-causes-mostly-led-by-white-pastors-report-212431/"}

There is no consensus that there is a so-called 'constitutional right' to abortion, even for American citizens, let alone pregnant teens who come into this country illegally,\" said Donovan.\n\n\"As controversial as Roe v. Wade has been, it has never been interpreted this way. We believe HHS has a strong case that will likely go all the way to the Supreme Court.\"\n\nDonovan expressed concern over the potential opening of \"abortion tourism\" in which \"vulnerable young girls \u2013 who may have been abused or trafficked\" will \"travel to the United States to get abortions.\"\n\nA Change in Policy\n\nLast October, the Trump administration reversed President Barack Obama's policy of allowing for pregnant illegal immigrant minors to obtain abortions.\n\nThe Administration for Children and Families, which oversees the Office of Refugee Resettlement, explained that there was \"no constitutional right for a pregnant minor to illegally cross the U.S. border and get an elective abortion while in federal custody.\"\n\n\"Federal law is very clear on giving the director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement the legal responsibility to decide what is in the best interests of a minor in the unaccompanied alien children program and, in this case, her unborn baby,\" stated the ACF, as quoted by Politico.\n\n\"The Office of Refugee Resettlement is providing excellent care to this young woman and her unborn child and fulfilling our duty to the American people ... We cannot cede our responsibility to care for minors and their babies by releasing them to ideological advocacy groups.\"\n\nACLU Litigation\n\nIn response to the policy change, the ACLU filed complaints on behalf of four undocumented pregnant teenagers, known in court documents as \"Jane Doe,\" \"Jane Roe,\" \"Jane Poe,\" and \"Jane Moe.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the ACLU directed CP to a Jan. 11 blog entry by Brigitte Amiri, senior staff attorney at the ACLU's Reproductive Freedom Project.\n\nExpand | Collapse (Photo: REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein) Pro-life and pro-choice activists gather at the Supreme Court for the National March for Life rally in Washington January 27, 2017.\n\nAmiri explained that the ACLU is pursuing a lawsuit, known as Garza v. Hargan, in district court to overturn the administration's general ban on abortions for undocumented minors.\n\n\"Until the court makes that ruling, we find ourselves in the position of having to request temporary restraining orders against the government in each individual case we find out about,\" wrote Amiri.\n\n\"As we made clear in our court papers ... the Trump administration is blatantly ignoring the fact that the Supreme Court has held for the past 45 years that abortion is a fundamental constitutional right. And that right does not depend on immigration status.\"\n\nThus far, the ACLU has been successful in getting abortions for undocumented minors. Doe was able to get her abortion in late October, both Roe and Poe got theirs in December, and Moe was released earlier this month to do the same.\n\nIn its efforts to get abortions for the undocumented minors, the ACLU has been accused by the Justice Department of misleading the government on certain details.\n\nFor example, Justice Department filed a petition to the Supreme Court last November claiming that ACLU lawyers had agreed to keep it informed about the procedure, and that they purposefully moved the abortion of one of the minors from Oct. 26 to Oct. 25, before the administration could appeal to the high court.\n\n\"In light of that, the Justice Department believes the judgment under review should be vacated and discipline may be warranted against Jane Doe's attorneys,\" stated the Department.\n\nDonovan of the Lozier Institute explained that these releases did not reflect a change in policy, but rather that the minors had found sponsors and were thus no longer in ORR custody.\n\n\"'Jane Moe' found a sponsor, usually an adult family member in the U.S., and is no longer in federal custody. Placing unaccompanied minors with a sponsor is always a priority for HHS, and once the child leaves their direct custody, medical decisions are handled by the sponsor,\" noted Donovan.\n\n\"The Trump administration still strongly opposes facilitating abortions for young girls in their care, out of compassion for both them and their unborn children. America is a pro-life nation and we ought to respond with love to both young mother and child.\"\n\nTaxpayer Expenses\n\nSteven Aden, chief legal officer for Americans United for Life, told CP that the debate over the Trump administration's policy involves taxpayers funding of abortion.\n\nAlthough the ACLU has noted in the past that private funds are used for the abortion procedure, Aden countered that other aspects connected to the abortion required federal expenditures.\n\nExpand | Collapse (Courtesy, The Heritage Foundation) Internal Revenue Service\n\n\"Legally, they have jurisdiction and responsibility for her, they have to assign staff to be with her, there are other resources that are utilized to follow up on her as well as medical resources that are utilized to follow-up on her condition after the abortion to make sure that it went well,\" said Aden.\n\n\"So all these things are paid for by taxpayer dollars, so it is a subsidization of elective abortion on the part of the minor by U.S. taxpayer dollars.\"\n\nAden felt that the administration's position \"faithfully reflects existing federal law,\" noting that the Hyde Amendment prohibits the federal funding of abortion in most circumstances.\n\n\"That is why the ACLU and its allies are pushing on this issue right now because they see a vulnerable point. Everyone is talking about immigration right now, their argument is that the administration should allow minor immigrants to obtain elective abortions,\" continued Aden.\n\n\"But the point is that they're in the country illegally and to allow them to obtain elective abortions would require the use of federal taxpayer dollars to monitor, follow up, to provide treatment and that's just contrary to what the law has always said at least since the Hyde Amendment came into effect in the late '70s.\"\n\nAden believed that this was the ACLU's best route, for \"they can't make much headway obviously in the state legislatures and Congress, [since] the Republicans control both houses.\"\n\n\"So they've chosen to push on this point, the point they see as a point of vulnerability which is immigration, but the principle remains that our tax dollars are not to be used to promote, to subsidize, to facilitate elective abortion,\" he noted.\n\n\"It goes contrary to the conscience of the taxpayer.\"", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/aclu-undocumented-minors-political-pawns-abortion-debate-pro-life-214683/"}

You get a do-over' ... This is what he is committed to and as long as he commits to that and continues on that, he will have the support of evangelicals.\"\n\nDespite noting that evangelicals strongly support Trump for his policy efforts as president, Perkins warned that \"evangelical support is not unconditional.\"\n\n\"If the president were to all of a sudden revert back to some of that behavior as president, the evangelical support will not be there for him,\" continued Perkins.\n\n\"It's not unconditional. This president keeps his commitment and his promise to the evangelicals that supported him, and he continues to walk the straight and narrow if you will, then the support will be there.\"\n\nPerkins' comments come not long after excerpts from a 2011 interview a porn star, who goes by the name Stormy Daniels, made claiming that she and Trump had an affair in 2006 after meeting at a golf event.\n\nEarlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that a lawyer for Donald Trump had paid $130,000 in hush money to Stormy Daniels to keep quiet the alleged affair during the election season.\n\nDaniels, whose given name is Stephanie Clifford, has claimed to multiple publications that she had sex with Trump around the time that his wife Melania had given birth to their son Barron.\n\nAccording to the story, Daniels and Trump began their affair in July 2006 at American Century celebrity golf tournament in which Trump invited the porn star into his room and they had what she later described as \"textbook generic\" sex.\n\nBen Shapiro, a conservative author and head of The Daily Caller, penned a column last week arguing that ultimately \"nobody will care\" about the Daniels affair because for most Americans these and other things have \"already been baked into the cake.\"\n\n\"Now, that doesn't mean that Trump's stock price is high enough to win him re-election, or drive serious support for Republicans in 2018. It isn't. But simply throwing gossipy headlines at him does nothing to him, because we knew who he was when we elected him,\" wrote Shapiro.\n\n\"Perhaps that says something about many religious Americans: in their view, they've despaired of the culture anyway, so they may as well support the guy who will enact their priorities. Perhaps it says something about American society more broadly: the worst seem to get ahead, while the most virtuous seem to get left behind.\"\n\nOthers have been more critical of Perkins' approach.\n\nConservative columnist Michael Gerson wrote for The Washington Post that Trump-supporting evangelicals \"have lost their gag reflex.\"\n\n\"Some Christian leaders are surrendering the idea that character matters in public life in direct exchange for political benefits to Christians themselves. It is a political maneuver indistinguishable from those performed by business or union lobbyists every day. Only seedier. You scratch my back, I'll wink at dehumanization and Stormy Daniels. The gag reflex is entirely gone,\" stated Gerson.\n\nIn response to Perkins' Politico interview, Gerson tweeted, \"If you are looking for evidence relating to my column today, look at this.\"", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/tony-perkins-evangelicals-trump-do-over-mulligan-porn-star-sexcapade-moral-failings-214843/"}

They are much more magical than most people are aware of.\n\nNot only do cats protect our homes from mice and anything in the form of a laser pointer, they also ward off evil spirits and block out negative energies. Cats are known for being able to sense negative energies and being able to correct them. Most people seem to feel a sense of peace when a happy kitty in is their presence.\n\nCats are aware of our auras and can sense when our energies are shifting. They can enter our auras and correct them. Cats, as strange as it may sound, are able to provide us with a healing therapy. Spiritually having a feline friend will help keep you at the top of your game. Even in Buddhist teachings a cat often acts as a temporary resting place for the soul of a highly spiritual person.\n\nCats are able to make us aware that there is a spirit or something of that sort in our homes. If you ever notice your cat hissing at nothing it is because they are sensing something you are unable to. They are also able to share their vibrations with us when they show affection. Have you ever been loving on a cat and noticed an instant feeling of relaxation come over you? That cat was sharing its vibrations.\n\nWhile some people think all cats are lazy, they are lazy for good reason. When your cat is sleeping it is releasing all of the negative energies it has absorbed from you. If your cat sleeps more than anything else it is because he or she is doing you a lot more favors than you think. To be completely honest it is good to have more than one cat so that they can share the burden.\n\nSome people even go so far as to believe that angels appear as cats. Peter Kreeft wrote in his book \u201cAngels and (Demons): What Do We Really Know About Them?\u201d that he thought his guardian angel inhabited the body of his pet cat when he was feeling down. He said there was something special about his cat and that it influenced him in many ways.\n\nThat being said, you don\u2019t have to be looking at a cat in its spirit form to know it is special. You can gain inspiration from being around any cat. Now I know there are some anti-cat people out there who will claim that there is nothing magical about felines but I beg to differ. There is definitely something there. Also, before you start thinking I am a crazy cat person, I actually still prefer dogs either way.\n\nImage via", "domain": "awarenessact.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://awarenessact.com/how-cats-can-protect-you-and-your-home-from-evil-spirits-and-bad-energy/"}

This could mean you are being psychically attacked and you need to know how to combat these things.\n\nIf you think negative thoughts or psychic attacks are being pushed onto you then you need to do something about them. While you cannot stop them from happening, you can keep them from controlling your life. These things come from others and are often unintentional. You see, when someone is jealous of you or even doesn\u2019t like you the things they put out into this world have more power than they realize. Below you will find a list of things that can and will help you when these situations arise.\n\n6 Things to Do When You Feel Psychic Attacks Heading Your Way:\n\nThis is a pretty popular practice. During meditation imagine a white light at your solar plexus chakra point and allow it to expand ever so gently. With each breath, it will grow brighter. Once it expands beyond the borders of your body you will begin to notice a difference. Think of this as a means of clearing away the negative feelings attacking your body.\n\nThis is known as smudging. I suggest using white sage as it is the most easily accessible and will do the job. Cleanse your person and your home. This will rid you of any negativity that may have been lingering.\n\nYou can do your own research and figure out which crystals work best for you specifically but for me, black tourmaline works wonders. I carry this in my pocket every single day. Once you get into the swing of carrying crystals you will notice a big change.\n\n4. Enforce healthy boundaries.\n\nIf you find these attacks are coming from a specific person limit their presence in your life. No one should be able to hold power over your being. If they are bringing you down cutting them out is essential.\n\n5. Make it clear you will no longer be affected.\n\nTell yourself verbally that you will no longer let these attacks bother you or affect your life. This is setting your intentions and making it clear that you will not be broken. As mentioned above the things we put out in the world hold more power than we realize.\n\n6. Meditate more often to strengthen your aura.\n\nMeditate as much as you can. Clear your mind and really work to bring a deeper sense of strength to your aura. This is much easier than it sounds.", "domain": "awarenessact.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://awarenessact.com/6-ways-to-handle-a-psychic-attack/"}

The Supreme Court ruled on Friday that the U.S. Constitution provides same-sex couples the right to marry in a historic triumph for the American gay rights movement.\n\nA bill that would eliminate the need for a marriage license and wedding ceremony to be legally married in Alabama could soon become law in a move local legislators argue would bring the state in line with the 2015 Supreme Court ruling on Obergefell v. Hodges which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide.\n\nThe bill, which has already passed the Alabama Senate, according to AL.com, would create a new process that would allow couples to submit affidavits to probate judges which would then be used as an official record of their marriage.\n\nThese affidavits would only be required to state that the spouses are at least 18, or at least 16 with parental consent, are not currently married and are not related by blood or adoption the report said. All other aspects of marriage such as divorce, child custody and child support are expected to remain the same in the state. The cost of this new process will be the same as the current cost of a marriage license, which is about $70.\n\nRepublican sponsor of the bill Sen. Greg Albritton who has sponsored similar bills since Obergefell v. Hodges, said the Supreme Court decision made his bill necessary.\n\n\"We have to bring a bill because of the decision,\" he said. \"I can't change the decision. That decision is the law of the land. The only thing I can do is try to make it easier and try to find some kind of middle ground that we in Alabama can live under that law.\"\n\nThe new process would remove the state's role in any marriage ceremonies, properly separating church and state, he said.\n\nCurrent state laws also do not require probate judges to issue marriage licenses, which protected the freedom of conscience for judges whose views didn't align with the Supreme Court ruling.\n\nA number of judges, such as Washington County Probate Judge Nick Williams, stopped issuing marriage licenses after the Supreme Court ruling. Williams argued that the Supreme Court had no authority to \"redefine\" marriage because God created the institution.\n\nThe new bill will remove that discretion from probate judges and only require them to accept and record properly completed affidavits presented by couples.\n\nWilliams, who argues there is a difference between recording a document and adding his signature to it, says if this new bill becomes law he will abide by its requirements and record all marriages.\n\nDemocrat State Rep. Patricia Todd said she would vote for the new bill because she agrees that the state should not be in the position of deciding who can marry and should have changed the law years ago.\n\nCurrent Alabama law states that a couple that has received a marriage license must \"solemnize\" the union in a ceremony. State law 30-1-7 says: \"Marriages may be solemnized by any licensed minister of the gospel in regular communion with the Christian church or society of which the minister is a member; by an active or retired judge of the Supreme Court, Court of Criminal Appeals, Court of Civil Appeals, any circuit court, or any district court within this state; by a judge of any federal court; or by an active or retired judge of probate.\"\n\nAlbritton explained that the language on \"licensed minister\" is ambiguous and the requirement for a ceremony entangles the state unnecessarily in what should be a private affair, according to AL.com.\n\nAlabama's House Judiciary Committee is expected to consider the bill on Wednesday, which could lead to a final vote in the House next week.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/alabama-bill-eliminates-marriage-license-wedding-ceremony-same-sex-gay-marriage-ruling-214979/"}

The Heritage Foundation has named a new president, and one with a connection to The Colson Center. Kay Coles James has a distinguished 30-year career in and around Washington dating back to the Reagan administration. She was director of the Office of Personnel Management under George W. Bush and served as a senior advisor to Donald Trump during his transition to the White House. James received the Colson Center\u2019s annual Wilberforce Award in 1996. The Colson Center offers James thanks for agreeing to serve once again, and we congratulate Heritage, which, according to many, is the most important conservative think tank in the country, on this outstanding choice.\n\nSunday Service. Chick-fil-A is famous for its \u201cClosed on Sunday\u201d policy. But last Sunday night, the Atlanta-based business agreed to serve stranded travelers and emergency workers in Atlanta affected by the huge power outage at Hartsfield International Airport. A statement released by Chick-fil-A read: \u201cThe mayor called about 10 p.m. and asked for assistance. We immediately mobilized staff and team members who live and work near the airport, and they are making sandwiches and delivering them to the EOC (emergency operations center).\u201d According to WORLD, \u201cThe Christian-owned fast-food chain headed up by CEO Dan Cathy is known for observing the Sabbath by closing its restaurants on Sunday, but it also recognizes that sometimes it is called to perform \u2018works of necessity and mercy\u2019 on the Lord\u2019s Day.\u201d Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed tweeted, \u201cWe have provided 2,000 meals so far. Special thank you to Dan Cathy and @ChickfilA for their support.\u201d\n\nSigns of Life. Last week the Ohio General Assembly passed a bill banning abortions of babies diagnosed with Down syndrome. The legislation passed the state house in November and cleared the state senate last week. Gov. John Kasich has indicated he will sign the bill. The new law would prohibit abortions \u201cbecause an unborn child has or may have Down syndrome.\u201d Abortionists who violate the law would face a felony charge, though the mothers involved would not face prosecution.\n\nWorldview Matters. If you don\u2019t think worldview matters, consider Venezuela. It is, by some measures, one of the richest countries on the planet, with the world\u2019s largest proven oil reserves. So why are its people starving? The answer: a mindless commitment by the country\u2019s dictators to a Marxist/socialist ideology. For a powerful account of Venezuela\u2019s suffering, and the reasons why, please read this in-depth look from the photographers and writers of The New York Times.\n\nStories of the Year. The rise of \u201cTrumpvangelicals\u201d is the top religion story of 2017, according to a poll of religion news writers by Religion News Service. Trump was also the top religion newsmaker of the year, beating out Pope Francis, Martin Luther, and Roy Moore. WORLD magazine does not pick a top story in its \u201cNews of the Year\u201d special feature, but President Trump was prominent in its coverage, too. Other stories that merit year-end notice: North Korea\u2019s advancing nuclear weapons program, Hurricane Irma and other Atlantic storms that affected the U.S., the London terror attacks, the Las Vegas shooting, and the slaughter of 26 people at a Baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas.\n\nMilestones. On December 16, 1944, the Battle of the Bulge began. It lasted until January 25, 1945, and was the last full-scale battle of World War II in the European theatre, effectively destroying the German Luftwaffe. Germany surrendered on May 7, 1945\u2026. On this day in 1998, President Bill Clinton was impeached\u2026. Twenty years ago today the movie \u201cTitanic\u201d opened. It went on to become the second-greatest hit of all time (behind \u201cAvatar\u201d), grossing more than $2 billion at the box office.\n\nImage: Chas Geer/The Heritage Foundation\n\nWarren Cole Smith is an investigative journalist and author as well as the Colson Center vice- president for mission advancement.", "domain": "breakpoint.org", "label": 0, "url": "http://breakpoint.org/2017/12/heritage-chooses-chick-fil-serves-syndrome-babies-protected-venezuela-ravaged-religion-stories-ranked/"}

You get a do-over' ... This is what he is committed to and as long as he commits to that and continues on that, he will have the support of evangelicals.\"\n\nPerkins did go on to explain to Politico that \"evangelical support is not unconditional\" and that Trump could lose that support.\n\n\"If the president were to all of a sudden revert back to some of that behavior as president, the evangelical support will not be there for him,\" continued Perkins.\n\n\"It's not unconditional.

(Hey, there are planes leaving everyday to return them to the sharia-ruled hellhole of their choice)\n\nVeiled Muslim women could find themselves subjected to verbal attacks by vigilantes who demand they remove their face-coverings the minute they sit down on a bus seat. Or they could be humiliated by being ordered to remove their covering in order to enter a government building. (Isn\u2019t that great? Citizens will help enforce the law)\n\n\u201cAs long as the service is being rendered, the face should be uncovered,\u201d Quebec Justice Minister St\u00e9phanie Vall\u00e9e said.

The association is backed by the government.\n\nUnderground Catholics, however, along with church pastors from other denominations, have for years faced a crackdown at the hands of Chinese authorities, with hundreds of worshipers and church leaders arrested.\n\nShantou, who is recognized by the Vatican, was asked to retire by the Holy See back in December, but has so far refused to do so.\n\nA source told AsiaNews that the Vatican has been trying to offer a consolation by allowing Shantou to nominate three priests for Huang to choose a vicar general from.\n\n\"Bishop Zhuang could not help his tears on hearing the demand,\" the source explained, adding that \"it was meaningless to appoint a vicar general, who is still a priest that Bishop Huang could remove him anytime.\"\n\nCritics, such as Rod Dreher, editor of the American Conservative, who converted from Catholicism to Eastern Orthodoxy, called the situation \"beyond disgusting.\"\n\n\"It is possible to hold on throughout the persecution. Perhaps the thinking in Rome is that it is better to guarantee the validity of the sacraments throughout the communist time, so that the Catholic Church will still validly be present when communism passes,\" he said.\n\nDreher pointed out that Catholic and Orthodox ecclesiology is different from Protestant ecclesiology, as sacraments are valid even if a priest is personally corrupt.\n\n\"But without valid sacraments \u2014 which require a validly ordained bishop, and a validly consecrated clergy \u2014 there is no church, only ecclesial communities,\" he added.\n\n\"Maybe what Rome is trying to do is to gamble to keep the Catholic Church alive through the dark communist night. That's the best spin I can put on it.\"\n\nLast year, it was reported that the Vatican and the Communist Party were working on a deal aimed at ordaining Chinese bishops, seeking to end \"decades of frosty ties.\"\n\nChinaAid President Bob Fu told The Christian Post at the time, however, that Pope Francis needs to be aware that the Chinese government has not relented in its persecution of believers.\n\n\"A partnership between the Vatican and the Chinese government would worsen the lives of house church Christians. The Communist Party already targets clergy who are not ordained by the state as illegitimate, which leads to persecution, and having the Vatican's backing gives them a further excuse to do so,\" Fu told CP in March.\n\n\"They may also feel emboldened in their persecution of Christians who practice their faith outside of government churches, since such a union would be the Vatican's stamp of approval on the Party's approach to Christianity.\"", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/beyond-disgusting-critics-slam-vaticans-push-to-replace-chinese-bishops-with-communist-backed-ones-214976/"}

Millions of children across Syria and in neighboring countries have suffered the devastating consequences of unabating levels of violence in several parts of the country,\" the organization said in a statement.\n\n\"UNICEF received information from inside east Ghouta that people are taking shelter underground in fear for their lives. One particular heavy attack on residential buildings was so strong it reportedly injured 80 civilians including children and women. Medical personnel struggled to pull survivors out of the rubble.\"\n\nThe BBC video further shows how survivors of the attacks are struggling without shelter, food or jobs. There's no money to purchase firewood either as families suffer in winter cold temperatures.\n\nAnd desperate families have risked their lives crossing snow-covered mountains in freezing temperatures to find safety in Lebanon. At least 12 Syrians, including two children, died last week during such treks, according to UNICEF.\n\n\"More children could be among the dead as residents in the area and the Lebanese authorities continue to look for people who are reportedly trapped in the mountainous in freezing temperatures and snow,\" said Geert Cappelaere, UNICEF regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, on Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, watchdog groups, such as the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, have said that chlorine gas has been used in the bombing of Syrian cities, though the government's army continues to deny that it has used any kind of chemical weapons against its own people.\n\nThe United States has continued to insist that Syria is not only using chemical weapons in its fight against rebels, which has contributed to the deaths of thousands of innocent civilians, but that Russia is complicit by continuing to stand by Assad.\n\n\"There is simply no denying that Russia, by shielding its Syrian ally, has breached its commitments to the United States as a framework guarantor and has betrayed the chemical weapons convention and the UN Security Resolution 2118,\" U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Tuesday, according to Fox News.\n\nTillerson was speaking about an agreement made in 2013 between Russia and the U.S. that would have secured the removal of chemical weapons from Syria.\n\n\"Russia's failure to resolve the chemical weapons issue in Syria calls into question its relevance to the resolution of the overall crisis,\" he added. \"At a very minimum, Russia must stop vetoing and at least abstain from future Security Council votes on this issue.\"\n\nNikki Haley, U.S. ambassador to the U.N., also accused Russia of failing to live up to the agreements.\n\n\"If these reports are true, this attack in Syria should weigh heavily on their conscience. The United States will never stop fighting for the innocent Syrian children, women, and men who have become victims of their own government and those who continue to prop it up,\" she said, referring to suspected poisonous gas use in the Duoma district on Monday.\n\nWatch the BBC video of the rubble rescue below:", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/shocking-footage-captures-screaming-syrian-child-being-rescued-50-other-children-killed-video-214977/"}

I see a child that is injured. He needs love. He needs care, and I have it and can give it,\" the mother declared.\n\n\"For them [the doctors] to say it's so poor it's not worth living, that's not right. That's not their decision to make.\"\n\nShe said that doctors have only assessed Isiah for short periods of time, but she sees first hand that he is not as unresponsive as they are claiming.\n\n\"The more I say to them that I have seen Isaiah open his eyes, they will dismiss it and say it's not. They are trying to say I'm not right,\" she continued.\n\nStill, expert medical witnesses say that there is often \"a mismatch between what parents perceive and what carers perceive to be purposeful responses.\"\n\nThey said that movements do not always mean a purposeful response, and in fact jaw-clenching and muscle-stiffening could be caused by severe dystonia.\n\nThomas' plight is similar to other high-profile cases of parents fighting for their child to be allowed to continue treatment, such as 11-month-old Charlie Gard last year.\n\nThe parents, Coonie Yates and Chris Gard, challenged Great Ormond Street Hospital in London's decision to stop treatment for Charlie, who had an extremely rare genetic condition that caused progressive brain damage and muscle weakness.\n\nThey petitioned to be allowed to take Charlie for experimental treatment in the United States, but were unsuccessful in their bid.\n\nThe case, which prompted many weeks of passionate debate, and drew comments from world leaders such as U.S. President Donald Trump and Vatican leader Pope Francis in support of the parents, ended late in July when Charlie died.\n\nThomas Evans and Kate James are two other British parents, this time fighting Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool, hoping that their 18-month-old boy, who is suffering from a mystery brain condition, is allowed continued treatment on life support.\n\nThe hospital has said that baby Alfie Evans is in a coma and suffers regular seizures and has no hope for recovery.\n\nThe parents insisted in December that their child has already defied expectations on a number of occasions when he had been given only hours to live, however, and continues fighting for his life.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/pentecostal-mother-fighting-brain-damaged-babys-life-god-decide-when-he-dies-215107/"}

The city of Afrin is being bombarded by Turkish airstrikes. We are asking for intervention, and protection against the violent attacks which are being levied against use at the moment.\"\n\n\"Many lives are in mortal danger,\" the letter, which was shared with The Christian Post, reads. \"We are requesting aid and assistance. We are unable to protect ourselves or our families against these attacks, neither are we able to offer assistance or shelter the innocents.\"\n\nAccording to the letter, there are more than 200 Christian families that live in the Afrin area.\n\nAfrin is an isolated part of the Syrian federation that borders areas controlled by Islamist rebels and the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nIn Afrin, evangelical Christianity had steadily grown over the past several years, according to Johannes de Jong, the director of the European Christian think tank Sallux who has worked with Syriac Christians since the rise of the Islamic State in 2014.\n\n\"[I]t is only since the beginning of the civil war that these churches started to grow. This was also possible as the Federation of Northern Syria realized full freedom of religion which allowed the public establishment of churches and missionary work,\" de Jong told CP on Tuesday. \"[Ninety-five percent] of the believers have a Muslim background so almost all church members are converts to Christianity. There are at least three Christian congregations in the various parts of Afrin. The largest congregation consists of approximately 200 families.\"\n\nTurkey began its attack on the area last week on the grounds that the People's Protection Units, the Kurdish militia in Syria also known as YPG, is a terrorist group that threatens the NATO country's security.\n\nDe Jong, however, points out that YPG is part of the Syrian Democratic Forces that worked with the United States-led fight against the Islamic State.\n\n\"What we are hearing from these Kurdish churches in Afrin is that they have to sleep in basements out of fear of bombings,\" de Jong said. \"Some are hiding in the mountains. I am getting quite terrible pictures. It is clearly a threat to the freedom of these Christian communities. The existence of these Christian communities is really under threat. As Christians, they simply know what will be coming for them if these al Qaeda-type of militias take over the area.\"\n\nDe Jong expressed concern that terrorist outfits such as the al Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front are involved in the Turkish attack on Afrin.\n\n\"The Turkish outlet 'Cumhuriyet Gazetesi' published these pictures of the Turkish allies in the Afrin operation. Thanks to that we now have evidence that al-Qaeda is part of the Turkish-backed militias that are part of the invasion in Afrin,\" de Jong explained in an email. \"The intention of these pictures is to show the Turkish allies. The man [in photo No. 21 on the website] wears a [bandana] of Al Nusra. [It is] undisputed is that al-Nusra is al-Qaeda in Syria. It is unbelievable that such a threat is supported by anyone at all.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis urged Turkey to use restraint in its operations in Syria.\n\n\"This could be exploited by ISIS and al-Qaeda, obviously, that we're not staying focused on them right now. And obviously it risks exacerbating the humanitarian crisis that most of Syria is going through,\" Mattis told reporters during his trip to Indonesia.\n\nMattis' comment comes after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Monday that \"We recognize and fully appreciate Turkey's legitimate right to protect its own citizens from terrorist elements.\n\nDe Jong criticized Tillerson's remark and called on American Christians to stand up and urge the U.S. government to take action to stop the Turkish operation in Afrin.\n\n\"We hear Rex Tillerson speaking about Kurdish concerns for their security. Turks are at the same moment using al-Qaeda militias to attack Afrin and these Kurdish Christians are literally crying out for help. What is this?\" de Jong asked. \"What needs to happen now is that U.S. Christians need to stand up and tell the Trump administration that this needs to stop immediately. There is no right to bomb a civilian population. There is no right in any NATO treaty or whatever to indiscriminately bomb civilians.\"\n\n\"These guys have already said there is no place for Christians. These Kurdish Christians, you can see it in the statements that they make, they know that these jihadists are the real threat for them,\" de Jong continued. \"This is happening right now and the U.S. is allowing it to happen.\"\n\nDe Jong asserted that if the U.S. wanted to, it could have a military presence in Afrin.\n\n\"There is no problem any more to go to Afrin. First of all, the Russians pulled back. That means that airspace is open. The second point is that U.S. forces have already been between the rest of the federation and Afrin. If they can be there once, they can be there again. Russia will not object. Turkey will not really be able to object because they can't directly attack the U.S. and the U.S. could say if they want that they are going after these al-Qaeda guys that are hiding in these areas. Obviously, they will be able to stop the attack in Afrin.\"", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/christian-churches-under-attack-amid-turkeys-bombardment-syrian-city-214838/"}

She allegedly paid for her niece to be smuggled into the U.S. from Honduras then sold her to Julio Amilcar Jimenez-Ramirez, 34, who was also arrested. Local police got involved with the case after Romero-Perez reported her niece had run away.\n\nPolice eventually located the teenager, who produced receipts to show payments toward her sale price.\n\nRomero-Perez had entered into an informal agreement with Jimenez-Ramirez that he would pay the teen $600-$700 monthly. After the teen moved in with Jimenez-Ramirez, however, her aunt became impatient with the payments and threatened to call the police.\n\n\"[Jimenez-Ramirez said] the aunt was extorting the money from him and he was threatened that she would tell the police and call immigration on him,\" said Comal County Sheriff Office Detective Anthony Moreno.\n\nRomero-Perez' niece became pregnant and gave birth as a result of her relationship with Jimenez-Ramirez and the child was placed in the care of Child Protective Services.\n\nShortly after Robison delivered his message from God to the jurors deliberating the case, he recused himself from the remainder of the proceedings.\n\nDespite the divine word, the jury panel of seven men and five women found two hours later that there was enough to convict Romero-Perez on one count of continuous traffic of a person and was sentenced to 25 years in prison. She was acquitted on a second charge of sale or purchase of a child.\n\nThe State Commission on Judicial Conduct did not say whether Robison was being investigated but they said actions like that could lead to punishment, according to News 4 San Antonio.\n\nEric L. Vinson, executive director of the State Commission on Judicial Conduct, said: \"That's an issue that we would definitely investigate and present to the commission as potential misconduct. Legally, a judge is really not supposed to be weighing in on the facts of the case.\"\n\nThe woman's attorney had asked for a mistrial but was denied. Robison is currently on leave but is expected to return to work on Jan. 31.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/texas-judge-says-god-told-him-suspected-sex-trafficker-was-not-guilty-214684/"}

There was no immediate indication how well the youth, who officials said faces multiple charges of murder and attempted murder, knew the victims.\n\n\"There's no good answer for it,\" Bevin told reporters at an afternoon news conference. \"There's 1,000 hypotheses we're not going to go into.\"\n\nThe bloodshed at the school, where nearly 1,150 students are enrolled, was the latest outbreak of gun violence that has become a regular occurrence at schools and college campuses across the United States over the past several years.\n\nTuesday's carnage occurred just 32 miles (52 km) from Heath High School in West Paducah, Kentucky, where in 1997 a 14-year-old boy opened fire on a group of students, killing three.\n\nIn Tuesday's shooting, 14 students were struck by gunfire, two of them fatally. One, a 15-year-old girl, died at the scene, and a 15-year-old boy was pronounced dead at a hospital trauma center, Bevin said.\n\nFive of the 12 surviving wounded students were taken by helicopter to the Vanderbilt University Medical Center's trauma center in Nashville, a hospital spokeswoman said.\n\nAnother five students suffered non-gunshot injuries, Bevin said.\n\nKentucky State Police Commissioner Richard Sanders said the 15-year-old suspect walked into the school armed with a handgun and started shooting. The governor said the youth was apprehended at the scene \"in a nonviolent way,\" but Bevin did not elaborate.\n\nNo further details of the circumstances of the shooting were immediately divulged by authorities. None of the students involved were being publicly identified, Bevin said.\n\nAgents from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation were taking part in the investigation, officials said at the news conference.\n\nThe school serves Marshall County, which has population of about 31,000.\n\nDuring the news conference at the county Board of Education, Governor Bevin paused to collect himself as his voice choked with emotion, asking members of the news media to exercise restraint in dealing with the families of victims.\n\n\"I beg of you again - respect the fact that these children belong to this community and to specific families in this community.

Justice Babak Barin ruled that Quebec cannot force people to uncover their faces until the province establishes clear guidelines under which someone can apply for a religious accommodation.\n\nBill 62 was passed in October and was criticized for targeting Muslim women because they are among the few people in society who wear face veils.\n\nSection 10 of the law forces everyone to show their face when receiving or giving a public service and section 11 allows citizens to be exempted from that rule if they are granted an accommodation for religious reasons.

The government gave itself until next summer to establish the guidelines for religious accommodation requests.\n\nQuebec\u2019s law was challenged by the National Council of Canadian Muslims and the Canadian Civil Liberties Association.They argued section 10 of the Act violates the right to freedom of religion and to equality and requested it be put on hold pending a final ruling by the court on whether or not it is unconstitutional.\n\nBarin granted a temporary stay only \u2014 until the government creates guidelines for religious accommodations.

Prominent men in almost every industry have fallen from grace. Women have risen up to say \"no more.\"\n\nRecently, Hollywood made a bold statement as women and men paraded down the Golden Globes red carpet wearing black in solidarity with the #TimesUp and #MeToo movements. Though this display of support won't replace real action, it is a sign that Hollywood is saying mistreating and abusing women in any form will no longer be tolerated.\n\nContrast that with what is happening in the Christian Church.\n\nOn Jan. 7, prominent Memphis pastor Andy Savage admitted to a sexual encounter with a high school student 20 years ago, after the woman involved made her story public. He received a standing ovation from his congregation after asking for forgiveness.\n\nWhat are we doing, Church?\n\nThe Church has operated under a cloud of shame and silence for decades. I experienced this firsthand when I came to my church for help as a victim of domestic violence. After years of enduring physical, mental, and emotional abuse, I filed for divorce and turned to my lifelong church for aid.\n\nInstead of helping, my church instead called me before church discipline as punishment for divorce. My ex-husband received no condemnation.\n\nDuring my years in women's ministry, I have seen my story repeated dozens of times. I've met women who weren't believed or who were returned to their abusers with the admonishment to \"submit.\" We've seen similar stories play out in the news, but for every woman brave enough to bring her story to the press, there are likely hundreds more suffering in silence.\n\nWhile secular society has recently rushed to correct its mistakes in silencing women, the Church seems to be doubling down. Instead of condemning the abuse of a high school student, a congregation supported its pastor without question. There was no talk of how a church should handle these incidents or the emotional consequences experienced by the woman involved. Instead, the congregation only discussed forgiveness for Andy Savage and remorse that his victim was not on the same \"road to healing.\"\n\nThe Church should always set the moral example for the rest of the world, and on this issue we have failed. We've sat back and allowed Hollywood to take responsibility for advocating for women instead of rising up against the sin in our midst. While the Church should practice grace and forgiveness, there must be real, tangible consequences for sexual misconduct \u2014 especially when it involves a minister using his power to coerce women into sexual acts.\n\nIt's time for leaders to take women seriously. When a woman comes forward, whether she's sharing about domestic violence or sexual misconduct of a minister, there needs to be a swift response from church leadership. Her safety \u2014 both emotional and physical \u2014 must be of utmost importance. The leadership's first instinct should be her care, not determining \"whether she's telling the truth\" or \"whether she participated willingly.\"\n\nIf pastors across the nation don't take immediate steps to advocate for the women in their congregations by speaking out against domestic violence and sexual misconduct, we are abdicating our role as the moral compass of our nation. We cannot expect America to look to us for guidance when we are disregarding the care of half the population. If we give up our responsibility on this issue, we give it up on every issue, from race relations to marriage.\n\nIf #TimesUp for Hollywood, it's way past due for the Church.\n\nThis article originally appeared at RNS.\n\nOriginally published at Red Letter Christians.\n\nThe goal of Red Letter Christians is simple: To take Jesus seriously by endeavoring to live out His radical, counter-cultural teachings as set forth in Scripture, and especially embracing the lifestyle prescribed in the Sermon on the Mount.

Debates over when life begins, whether a fetus can feel pain and at what stage a pregnancy can be terminated raise profound moral and medical questions.\n\nWhile interest groups on both sides of this contentious issue often use absolute claims and polarizing rhetoric to make their case, many Americans recognize the complexity of abortion should not be reduced to talking points or bumper stickers. In fact, a poll from Public Religion Research Institute found that 43 percent of respondents identified as both \"pro-choice\" and \"pro-life,\" a sign that binary categories are insufficient.\n\nA more productive national discussion could start with acknowledging that the way we talk about abortion can't begin with a culture-war approach, and finally recognizing the limits of single-issue politics.\n\nThere is nothing \"pro-life\" about defending life in the womb while walking away from our collective obligations to care for the child once that baby is born. This is exactly what President Trump and many politicians such as Speaker Paul Ryan, who will speak at the march, do when they shred social safety nets, fail to fund health insurance programs for low-income children, and put tax cuts for the wealthiest few before the needs of those in poverty.\n\nThe president has won over many political and religious conservatives with his appointment of anti-abortion judges, including Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. His administration pushed for expanded conscience exemptions to contraception coverage requirements in the Affordable Care Act, and like every Republican president since Ronald Reagan, he reinstated the so-called Mexico City policy, which forbids U.S. aid money going to any international group that funds or promotes abortion.\n\nFor some voters and political leaders, these checks on the scorecard are a sign that Trump passes the test.\n\nThere are signs that a more expansive understanding of what constitutes a \"life issue\" is challenging that narrow vision. Pope Francis, the world's most influential religious leader, is driving that conversation.\n\nThe pope strongly opposes abortion, but has also elevated what he calls an \"economy of exclusion and inequality\" that \"kills,\" the death penalty, climate change and the treatment of immigrants as central pro-life concerns.\n\nWhen asked by reporters about President Trump's decision to rescind an Obama-era program that protected some 800,000 young immigrants brought to the United States as children, Francis didn't equivocate. \"The President of the United States presents himself as pro-life,\" the pope said, \"and if he is a good pro-lifer, he understands that family is the cradle of life and its unity must be protected.\"\n\nClimate change is \"one of the principal challenges facing humanity,\" according to the pope, a stark difference from a president who pulled out of the Paris climate agreement and who once called global warming a hoax invented by the Chinese.\n\nFrancis also helpfully rejects the kind of simple categorizations that limit American political debates. \"Everything is connected,\" he writes in \"Laudato Si,\" the first encyclical in the church's history to address environmental themes and climate change. Francis understands that climate change caused by human activity is already killing people in the poorest countries, and it contributes to a migrant crisis also exacerbated by war and economic exclusion.\n\nWhen Pope Francis visited the United States in 2015, he linked the need to protect life in the womb with \"children who die of hunger or from bombings, immigrants who drown in the search for a better tomorrow ... and the environment devastated by man's predatory nature.\"\n\nSeveral U.S. Catholic bishops are taking the pope's lead.\n\nBoston Cardinal Sean O'Malley, an influential advisor to the pope, calls immigration \"another pro-life issue.\" Chicago Archbishop Blase Cupich views gun violence as an urgent pro-life concern, and is a leader who forges alliances with progressives and Democratic politicians who disagree with the church's position on abortion. In a speech to the Chicago Federation of Labor, the cardinal spoke of \"feeding the hungry, sheltering the homeless, protecting the unborn, caring for the sick and welcoming immigrants\" as part of a \"consistent ethic of solidarity.\"\n\nThe language echoed the message of a previous Chicago cardinal, Joseph Bernardin, who in the 1980s became the most prominent American church leader. \"Those who defend the right to life of the weakest among us, must be equally visible in support of the quality of life of the powerless among us: the old and the young, the hungry and the homeless, the undocumented immigrant and the unemployed worker,\" Bernardin said in a 1983 speech at Fordham University.\n\nDebates over abortion shouldn't stop. But let's make sure the conversation about protecting life and human dignity doesn't end there.\n\nThis article originally appeared at RNS.\n\nOriginally published at Red Letter Christians.\n\nThe goal of Red Letter Christians is simple: To take Jesus seriously by endeavoring to live out His radical, counter-cultural teachings as set forth in Scripture, and especially embracing the lifestyle prescribed in the Sermon on the Mount.

Can modern medicine really \"reassign\" sex? Is sex something \"assigned\" in the first place? What's the loving response to a friend or child experiencing a gender identity conflict? What should our law say on these issues?\n\nThese shouldn't be difficult questions.\n\nJust a few years before \"When Harry Met Sally\" hit theaters, Dr. Paul McHugh thought he had convinced the vast majority of medical professionals not to go along with bold claims about sex and gender being proffered by some of his colleagues. And as chair of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins Medical School and psychiatrist-in-chief at Johns Hopkins Hospital, McHugh put a stop to sex-reassignment surgery at Hopkins.\n\nOnce the elite Johns Hopkins did this, many medical centers across the nation followed suit.\n\nBut in recent years we have seen a resurgence of these drastic procedures\u2014not in light of new scientific evidence, mind you, but as a result of a growing ideological movement. Such is our transgender moment.\n\nThe people increasingly in the spotlight of this moment are children.\n\nIn the past 10 years, dozens of pediatric gender clinics have sprung up throughout the United States. In 2007, Boston Children's Hospital \"became the first major program in the United States to focus on transgender children and adolescents,\" as its own website brags.\n\nA decade later, over 45 gender clinics opened their doors to our nation's children\u2014telling parents that puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones may be the only way to prevent teen suicides.\n\nNever mind that according to the best studies\u2014the ones that even transgender activists themselves cite\u201480 to 95 percent of children with gender dysphoria will come to identify with and embrace their bodily sex.\n\nNever mind that 41 percent of people who identify as transgender will attempt suicide at some point in their lives, compared to 4.6 percent of the general population. Never mind that people who have had transition surgery are 19 times more likely than average to die by suicide.\n\nThese statistics should stop us in our tracks. Clearly, we must work to find ways to effectively prevent these suicides and address the underlying causes. We certainly shouldn't be encouraging children to \"transition.\"\n\nMany psychologists and psychiatrists think of gender dysphoria as similar to other dysphorias, or forms of discomfort with one's body, such as anorexia. The feelings of discomfort can lead to mistaken beliefs about oneself or about reality, and then to actions in accordance with those false beliefs.\n\nThe most helpful therapies focus not on achieving the impossible\u2014changing bodies to conform to thoughts and feelings\u2014but on helping people accept and even embrace the truth about their bodies and reality.\n\nOperating in the background is a sound understanding of physical and mental health\u2014proper function of one's body and mind\u2014and a sound understanding of medicine as a practice aimed at restoring health, not simply satisfying the desires of patients.\n\nFor human beings to flourish, they need to feel comfortable in their own bodies, readily identify with their sex, and believe that they are who they actually are.\n\nIn my new book, \"When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment,\" I argue that McHugh got it right. The best biology, psychology, and philosophy all support an understanding of sex as a bodily reality, and of gender as a social manifestation of bodily sex. Biology isn't bigotry.\n\nIn my book I offer a balanced approach to the policy issues, a nuanced vision of human embodiment, and a sober and honest survey of the human costs of getting human nature wrong.\n\nDespite activists' best efforts to put up a unified front, Harry cannot become Sally. Activists' desperate insistence to the contrary suggests that the transgender moment is fleeting.\n\nOriginally posted at The Daily Signal.\n\nRyan T. Anderson, Ph.D., is the William E.

The plot followsa mute custodian who develops a sexual relationship with a humanoid-amphibian creature.\n\nDue to the film's graphic nudity, I will not see it. As to why it received so many nominations, I defer to a film critic who noted: \"Perhaps the best argument in its favor is that, in a weird way, it's a film that speaks to our times. One could interpret 'The Shape of Water' as being about a mute woman who finds her voice with the help of her gay and African American friends to take down the sexually predatory, bigoted patriarchy.\"\n\nIt seems that The Shape of Water celebrates \"love\" as defined however the characters choose to express it.\n\n\"Speaking your truth\"\n\nThe prevailing theme of our culture is the belief that truth is whatever you believe it to be. Oprah Winfrey made headlines in her Golden Globes speech when she announced, \"What I know for sure is that speaking your truth is the most powerful tool we all have.\"\n\nHowever, to claim that there is no such thing as absolute truth is to make an absolute truth claim. Nor does such a denial change the reality it denies.\n\nMore and more Americans are rejecting the concept of hell, but does their opinion change its existence? If I don't believe the Queen of England exists, does my aristocratic atheism change anything about her reign?\n\nThe denial of absolute truth also leads to ethical quicksand: Americans view the 9/11 attacks as cowardly terrorism, while al-Qaeda celebrates them as a courageous defense of Islam. Is each viewpoint just \"their truth\"?\n\nOf course, the rejection of objective truth leads inevitably to the rejection of objective sexual morality. Marriage becomes defined however its participants wish to define it. Your sexual identity is just that-yours. A sexual relationship between a human and a humanoid-amphibian creature becomes the plot for an Academy Award-nominated film.\n\nIf we disagree, we are labeled intolerant, bigoted, or worse.\n\nOne of the most powerful testimonies of deliverance from same-sex attraction I have ever seen is Emily Thomes's story. I strongly encourage you to watch her video. Appallingly, the ministry behind the video has received death threats. One person posted to Facebook, \"If I had the means, I would come there and kill every last one of you!\"\n\n\"God designed the human machine to run on Himself\"\n\nMartin Luther observed, \"The first commandment will stand and remain, that God is our God; this will not be accomplished in the present, but in the life everlasting.\" He is right, of course: we will not worship God fully and unconditionally until we are with him in heaven.\n\nBut consider what Luther concluded from this observation: \"All the other commandments will cease and end; for, in the life to come, the world will cease and end together with all external worship of God, all world policy and government; only God and the first commandment will remain everlastingly, both here and there.\"\n\nIn heaven, we will not need commandments against idolatry, adultery, murder, and the rest. We will not need to be commanded to keep the Sabbath or to honor our parents. We will keep the first commandment, and all the others will flow from it.\n\nNow consider the degree to which Luther's observation explains the moral morass of our day. If morality flows from worship in heaven, is not the same true on earth?\n\nHumans were created to need intimate relationship with our Creator. In Mere Christianity, C. S. Lewis explained: \"God made us: invented us as a man invents an engine. A car is made to run on petrol, and it would not run properly on anything else. Now God designed the human machine to run on Himself. He Himself is the fuel our spirits were designed to burn, or the food our spirits were designed to feed on. There is no other. That is why it is just no good asking God to make us happy in our own way without bothering about religion. God cannot give us a happiness and peace apart from Himself, because it is not there.\"\n\nThe UK recently appointed a minister for loneliness to deal with what Prime Minister Theresa May calls \"the sad reality of modern life\" for too many people. If we are children cut off from our Father, should we be surprised at the epidemic of loneliness in our culture?\n\nYesterday's violence in Kentucky is the eleventh school shooting this year and tragic proof that we need a Prince of Peace. According to Gallup, 77 percent of Americans say our moral values are getting worse.\n\nA personal question\n\nIf we cut a flower at its roots, the flower inevitably dies. As Jesus noted, \"the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine\" (John 15:4).\n\nAccording to our Lord, there's only one way to live with flourishing purpose: \"Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing\" (v. 5).\n\nIs American society \"abiding\" in Jesus today? Here's a more personal question: Are you?\n\nNOTE: I would like to invite you to attend a special upcoming event at Dallas Baptist University on Monday, February 12.

Although there was palpable relief that Hillary Clinton was not elected president in November 2016, many still harbored concerns about President-elect Donald Trump. Trump certainly campaigned as an opponent of abortion in both the primary and the general election. However, unlike previous Republican presidential nominees, he did not have a track record of voting for pro-life bills or supporting pro-life initiatives. However, most pro-lifers have been pleasantly surprised by the Trump administration.\n\nOne of the president's first actions was to both reinstate and strengthen the Mexico City policy, which prevents foreign-aid money from being used to pay for abortions overseas. President Trump also defunded the United Nations Population Fund. It has a long history of involvement in China's brutal birth-limitation policy, which routinely included forced abortions. Finally, Trump's executive-branch appointments and his judicial nominees, especially Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, have received praise from pro-lifers. Of course, the work is far from over.\n\nThis year is shaping up to be an extremely important year for the pro-life movement. That is because Republican majorities in both the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate have made possible two important pro-life policy objectives. The first is to defund Planned Parenthood. The second is a federal ban on abortions after 20 weeks. Pro-lifers should move boldly, because the twin pro-life strategies of defunding big abortion and pursuing incremental legislation have proven to be very effective in the past. Some history is instructive. One of the most important legislative victories for pro-lifers was the passage of the Hyde Amendment in 1976. It prevents federal Medicaid dollars from being used to pay for elective abortions. After years of litigation, the Hyde Amendment was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1980, and the abortion rate has fallen nearly every year since then.\n\nAdditionally, both pro-life and pro-choice analysts agree that the amendment has reduced abortion rates. In my analysis of it, I find that it has saved 2.1 million lives between 1976 and 2016. The defunding of Planned Parenthood needs to be a priority. The upcoming Department of Justice investigation will almost certainly reveal damaging information about the organization. Furthermore, Republican elected officials should not be scared by the inevitable misinformation campaign that will take place. Ever since Texas defunded Planned Parenthood in 2011, the media have worked overtime to find evidence of a public-health crisis in the Lone Star State. However, most public-health trends are positive. Minor pregnancies and minor abortions in Texas are down by 33 percent and 49 percent, respectively, and there is no evidence of a significant increase in the rate of unintended pregnancies. The debate over a 20-week abortion ban will definitely shape public opinion in a way that will benefit the pro-life cause. Since 1973, the biggest gain in pro-life public sentiment occurred in the mid 1990s, during the congressional and national debates over banning partial-birth abortion. The media attention given to that gruesome practice made many Americans reconsider their position on abortion. Something similar could happen with the 20-week abortion ban. Such bans have been popular politically: 20 states have passed bans on abortion after 20 weeks. And a significant body of survey data shows that women and young adults are actually more likely to support a 20-week abortion ban than are other demographic groups.\n\nAlthough we have not succeeded in overturning Roe. v Wade, we have enjoyed great success in reducing the abortion rate in the U.S. The abortion rate has been falling consistently for the past 34 years and is currently half of what it was in 1980. In fact, in 2014, the most recent year for which we have data, the abortion rate was lower than what it was in 1973, the year that Roe v. Wade was decided. Contrary to the claims of the mainstream media, the declines in the abortion rate are not due to increases in contraceptive use. Rates of unintended pregnancy have been fairly stable for much of the past 35 years. Instead, the main factor driving the decline in the abortion rate has been that a higher percentage of unintended pregnancies are being carried to term. Pro-life efforts to defund Big Abortion, pursue incremental legislation, and provide for the needs of pregnant women will continue to protect women \u2014 and their unborn children \u2014 for years to come.\n\nOriginally published at The National Review.\n\nMichael J.

This month, I would like to talk about hostility towards Christians worldwide.\n\nA recent report by Aid to the Church in Need documents that persecution of Christians today is worse than at any time in history. \"Not only are Christians more persecuted than any other faith groups. But ever-increasing numbers are experiencing the very worst forms of persecution.\"\n\nIn some countries the situation was already so severe, it is hard to imagine how it could be any worse. Other countries (like China) have seen intolerance on the rise, as evidenced by a clampdown on dissent clergy and the destruction of churches.\n\nMost of the countries where persecution against Christians is the most intense are Muslim countries (though North Korea and China are notable exceptions). Former Representative Frank Wolf has been on Point of View many times and recently called for the United State to take \"bold action\" to prevent Christianity in Iraq from disappearing altogether. Of course, ISIS remains a threat to Iraq's minority groups but they also face threat from a Baghdad-sanctioned Shiite militia.\n\nWorld Summit\n\nEarlier this year, the World Summit in Defense of Persecuted Christians was held in Washington, D.C. More than 600 victims and advocates from 130 countries gathered to raise awareness of the plight of persecuted Christians.\n\nFranklin Graham said that he \"spent time this week with two men whose brothers were among the Coptic Christians marched out on the beach in Libya and viciously beheaded by ISIS for refusing to deny Christ.\" Some were surprised to hear the story of one of the men who actually was from Chad and had NOT been a Christian prior to the day of his beheading. As the terrorists gave each Christian a choice to deny Jesus or die, they came to this man from Chad. He answered, \"Their God is my God.\" He was moved by the faith of these Christians and chose to die with them.\n\nVice President Mike Pence spoke at the summit. He observed, \"The reality is, across the wider world, the Christian faith is under siege. Throughout the world, no people of faith today face greater hostility or hatred than the followers of Christ.\" He also added that he believed \"ISIS is guilty of nothing short of genocide against people of Christian faith and it is time people called it by name.\"\n\nDuring the summit's final session, the organizers put forth a declaration that called for all believers to declare their allegiance with those who suffer for Christ's name. They pledged to promote awareness of persecuted Christians as well as pray and urge other believers to pray for those being persecuted. It also called for churches and individual Christians to provide practical assistance to the persecuted church.\n\nIgnored and Forgotten?\n\nWhenever I do a radio program on the plight of persecuted Christians, I notice two things. First, the number of people who call into the program drops significantly. Second, a number of those who do call the program complain that we should be more concerned with what is happening in America.\n\nI thought of this phenomenon when I read a commentary by Dennis Prager that asked: \"Why Don't Christians Help . . . Christians?\" He is asking a good question. He tells the story of how as a young American Jew he traveled to the Soviet Union and became the national spokesman for the Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry.\n\nHe spoke before synagogues of every denomination, Jewish federations, and Jewish groups on college campuses. For decades, virtually every synagogue in America has a \"Save Soviet Jewry\" sign in front of it. By contrast, he never saw a sign in front of a church that said \"Save Soviet Christians.\"\n\nToday Christians are being murdered and churches are being destroyed. We hear very little about it. Some of the attacks have made the news. More than 60 people were killed at the Our Lady of Salvation Church in Baghdad. Since that massacre, an estimated 100,000 Christians have left the country.\n\nIn Nigeria, armed men and bombers killed over 40 in a Christmas Eve attack. More than 200 Muslim rioters burned homes, churches, and police stations when the Nigerian people elected a Christian as president.\n\nIn Egypt, terrorists detonated a bomb at Saints Church in Alexandria as worshippers left a New Year's Eve service. The attack killed at least 23 of those attending Mass as the Coptic Christian church.\n\nRecently we had Johnnie Moore on Point of View to talk about his new book The Martyr's Oath. He begins the book and began our interview by talking about attending a Bible school graduation ceremony. The students repeated this martyr's oath in which they pledged their lives and death to Jesus. He felt like he was standing in the book of Acts, witnessing \"a raw, first-century Christianity\" that he had been shielded from in America.\n\nHe has since asked himself, \"Why are so few of us in America willing to live for Jesus when others are so willing to die for him?\" He noted that seeing Jesus through the eyes of the persecuted church has transformed him.\n\nHow Should We Respond?\n\nAs a church there are many ways we can respond. We can encourage church members and missionaries to go to these persecuted Christians and minister to them. We can set aside time in church to pray for persecuted Christians. Since 1996, the World Evangelical Fellowship has coordinated efforts of churches and Christian organizations to institute the first International Day of Prayer for the Persecuted Church.\n\nThe Scriptures admonish us to pray for those who are being persecuted. Hebrews 13:3 says, \"Remember those in prison as if you were their fellow prisoners, and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering.\" And Paul reminds us in 1 Corinthians 12:26 that, \"When one member suffers, all members suffer with it.\"\n\nWhat should you pray? Here are four prayer targets:\n\nFirst, pray for courage. It takes courage to stand for Christ in a country that is hostile to your beliefs and actively persecutes you.\n\nSecond, pray for faith. Pray that these persecuted believers will grow in grace and increase in faith as they face persecution.\n\nThird, pray for hope. It is hard to find reasons for hope in a world of persecution. Pray that they would be empowered and press on.\n\nFinally, pray for help. Many of these persecuted Christians need food, medicine and finances to survive.\n\nKerby Anderson is the Host of Point of View Radio Talk Show and also serves as the President of Probe Ministries.

Here are 4 ways:\n\n1. Take a break long enough to ask the really hard questions.\n\nGet out of the hamster wheel so that you can pray, think and evaluate. Ask yourself hard questions like:\n\n-How spiritually on-fire are my teenagers?\n\n-Are my teenagers accelerating in their faith or just coming to youth group?\n\n-Is my youth group growing because new disciples are being made and multiplied on a consistent basis?\n\nBe brutally honest. Ask God for divine insight.\n\nConsider getting away for a weekend to spend time thinking and praying about this. Read the the book of Acts and compare what you read in it with how you are running your youth ministry (or how it is running you!)\n\n2. Re-discover your mission.\n\nWe don't technically need a youth group mission statement because Jesus already gave us the ultimate one in Matthew 28:19,20, \"Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.\"\n\nThis is what we are called to do, to make and multiply disciples. If your youth group is more defined by meetings than accomplishing this mission then it has been \"hamsterized\", institutionalized, and needs freed from the ministry wheel.\n\nA few years ago I wrote a book called Gospelize your Youth Ministry that unpacks how to build a youth ministry that advances the Gospel and makes disciples. It's all rooted in the seven values that drove the early church. These same values can drive your ministry too if you get out of the wheel long enough to figure it out.\n\n3. Create a new cycle.\n\nSometimes we need to break the old cycle and accomplish your mission. If year after year you've been doing the same camp, same brand of curriculum, same old-same old and are getting the same results, it's time to break the cycle and create a new one.\n\nEverything we do should go through a mission grid. \"Is this (camp, conference, curriculum, activity, etc) going to help us get from here to there?\"\n\nAt Dare 2 Share we have seen youth leaders who have finally chosen to break the camp cycle and bring their teenagers to Lead THE Cause (our full week intensive training for disciple multiplication.) Many of them ask themselves afterward \"Why didn't I take my teenagers to this earlier?\"\n\nThe answer is simple. They were stuck on the ministry wheel, going to the same camp year after year because, well, that's what they've always done and that's where they've always gone.\n\nThey discover that Lead THE Cause actually helps them, not only get off the ministry wheel, but escape the cage altogether. And now they have the beginnings of a youth group that is making progress toward the mission God has put in their hearts!\n\n4. Ask God for his strength to escape the wheel!\n\nPaul tells the Ephesians believers, \"be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power\" Ephesians 6:10. This same power is available to you and me. God will give you the strength to escape the ministry wheel if you yield to his indwelling Spirit and take a courageous step of faith.\n\nThe collective power of the Trinity is available to you to escape the ministry wheel. Unleash it through faith and escape!\n\nLet's stop running around in circles. Let's start accomplishing the mission God has placed in our hearts!\n\nAfter all, we're not hamsters! We're ambassadors of the King!\n\nGreg Stier is the Founder and President of Dare 2 Share Ministries International.

Imagine your favourite armchair and then add all the electronic gadgetry that you can conjure up and here is a seat that can be electrically adjusted to your heart\u2019s content providing that ultimate driving position. Then of course there is the sheer height of this luxury off roader, which stands head and shoulders above most other vehicles apart from lorries. This means that the driver and front passenger have a marvellous view of the road ahead, which is perfect for overtaking. Despite its sheer size and weight this 4x4 is pretty quick off the mark and if the accelerator is pushed to the floor it makes safe light work of most opportunities that present themselves on the open road. Zero to 60mph is accomplished in a little over seven seconds, which is very impressive. There are so many luxuries fitted to this vehicle that it makes a Rolls Royce blush. Shut the door and the Range Rover ensures that the door is properly closed as you can see in the video at Testdrives.biz. The two section boot opens and closes at the push of a button. This is all well and good but ironically, after reading a newspaper article about how a woman lost her arm in the door of a neighbour\u2019s car, I come close to trapping mine in the boot of the Range Rover but thankfully escape with a light bruise.

Empaths are excellent at reading body language, and they are the best mind detectives!\n\nEmpaths are born with a gift; they have the ability to feel others feelings. Although this is handy when you need someone to talk to, this isn\u2019t their primary gift. Empaths are experts on human psychology by second nature. This gives them to ability to be able to tell when someone is faking, lying, or simply not who they said they were. Some nice people have cruel intentions, let\u2019s face it. Empaths just have the ability to recognize this.\n\nAs an empath, the best way to explain this is: the knowing just happens. We know how to read people, and we aren\u2019t easily fooled. If you are a cheating type of partner, don\u2019t get with an empath. You will soon enjoy the taste of your own medicine.\n\nEmpaths are Basically Lie Detectors\n\nWhen someone lies, they give off certain subconscious body movements and \u2018ticks\u2019, if you must. Common ways to identify a liar is their eye movement, and overwhelming intention to convince you. However, if you\u2019re an empath you already know this. You don\u2019t know how to explain why you know, you just do. It is the most prominent feeling you\u2019ll ever feel in your gut.\n\nDon\u2019t Try to Fool Them\n\nEmpaths feel other people\u2019s feelings \u2013 much more than they would want too. Because of this, they know when you\u2019re faking. Don\u2019t try and hide your cruel intentions around an empath \u2013 it simply won\u2019t work. Empathic people can see right through your conniving disguise. They often don\u2019t ever approach it either because they are also aware that you obviously have some kind of mental distortion.\n\nThey Sense Jealousy\n\nEmpathic people can feel when you are jealous of them. You might expect this to make them feel a bit charismatic, but that would be wrong. Empath\u2019s might know that you are jealous of them for whatever reason, and they will often demonstrate humility to make you feel more comfortable.\n\nThey Sense Hatred\n\nOne of the most prevalent senses an empath has is for hatred. Hatred is such a negative emotion it gives off a negative energy that is powerful. Empaths are drawn away by this feeling. They aren\u2019t hurt over your hatred, but would rather not have their soul affected by your negative energy. They do not lose sleep over any hatred, which often causes people to hate them even more. They are comfortable with who they are, and they expect to be nobody else.\n\nThey Know your Prejudices\n\nEmpaths will always know when you have a hidden prejudice. If you are discomforted by people with different colored skin, sexual orientation, or personality differences, they empath will very likely lose interest. Empathic people are not interested in people who are shallow or self-absorbed.\n\nThey Know you\u2019re not Fine\n\n\u201care you okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cyes, I am fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. Now tell me everything.\u201d\n\nIf you have ever had this conversation with a friend, they are more than likely an empath. Empaths know when you lie, and they also know when you feel bad. Having a friend you can talk to about things is a tremendous help! Take advantage of your friend\u2019s healing abilities and do not lie to them. Don\u2019t be afraid; they want to help.\n\nThey Can Read Lackey\u2019s Like a Book\n\nEmpaths hate small talk, and they hate sucking up even more. Don\u2019t falsely compliment an empath to gain their affection. They actually hate this, and they see what you\u2019re doing. An Empath\u2019s most powerful ability is deciphering people\u2019s actions and intentions.\n\nThey Know When You\u2019re on The Wrong Path\n\nIf you have an empathic friend and they are warning you about things you\u2019ve been doing, LISTEN TO THEM. Empaths are so good at predicting self-destruction it is similar to time travel. They know your subconscious reasoning for acting out and it isn\u2019t worth it \u2013 and they will tell you that too. When an empath is telling you that you are heading for a dark place, you better seriously reevaluate your intentions.\n\nThey Know When You\u2019re Trying to be Someone You\u2019re Not\n\nEmpaths have the ability to see a personals spirit. They appreciate your perks and your flaws! There is nothing more attractive to an empath than someone who is their self. When you try to put on an act, they will know. Be confident in your own skin and don\u2019t try to be someone you\u2019re not. Especially in front of an empath.\n\nThey Can Identify Exploitation\n\nRemember when you were a kid and you wanted something, so you would \u2018butter up\u2019 your parents to get what you want.

When vibrational energy and information are introduced via sound, light, or other vibrational stimuli, physical systems change their form and function. Vibration can be perceived in multiple sensory ways, with all of our 5 senses being ways of interpreting vibratory patterns in our environment. Everything that is perceived to exist in physical reality is just the narrow, dense layer of wave forms and vibration that is being projected and manifested by higher density vibrational fields. Physicists have discovered that any particle which appears to exist is in a sense a snapshot of a wave, which appears in a momentary frozen form as a result of the observer perceiving it in order to crystallize a reality for the observer. Nothing is truly solid or stable, everything is energy in some state of motion, i.e. vibration.\n\nThe various layers of vibratory reality that underlie the physical realm are expressions of consciousness. Mystical teachers have always explained that consciousness and spirit are the fundamental reality, and the physical realm just a mirror or projection, a feedback tool for consciousness to observe and understand itself. Scientists who study nuclear physics will recognize that in just a single atom is the potential energy to provide massive amounts of power if that atom is split (nuclear atomic fission). This illustrates how much energy is involved in bringing into form just a single atom. When we tap in to those deeper levels of energy and consciousness we access a tremendous power for transformation.\n\n\n\nIn the holographic principle, each part broken off from a hologram still contains access to the information to create the whole. For this to be true it implies that the hologram is a form of unified field, in which any lower level appearance of separation from that Source field is an illusion. This also means that the whole is reflected in the parts and that any change in a part will have a ripple effect that is reflected throughout the whole. We do not exist separate from one another or from our ultimate Source, whether we call that source God, Great Spirit, Infinite Intelligence, Divine Matrix, All That Is, Prime Creator, The Grand Architect, or Supreme Being.\n\nIf we examine the creation of a human being we can see a field of immense intelligence at work. Conception occurs with an egg and sperm and this microscopic entity now carries out programs to use its environment to grow according to rather precise parameters. Trillions of cells are created according to innumerable specifications and the organism is constantly monitoring its environment to adapt and adjust and maintain relative balance and harmony to sustain life. Just think of how much processing power and energy would be needed for a computer to perform such functions! For a human being, the processing power comes from the animating spirit, the spiritual field of consciousness and vibratory energy that is creating a human life. That spirit exists independent of the human identity, for it was present prior to the biological conception and will continue to exist when the physical body is released and decays. The spirit gathers memory and experience which contribute to its own evolution, to the consciousness of the whole of Creation, and to whatever it may choose to create next.\n\nAs we come to understand these principles underlying our reality and our life experience we can see how they relate to our health and healing. Health can be seen as a state of wholeness and balance, when we are in harmony with our higher source, with the unified field. What is occurring on the physical plane is always dependent upon what is occurring in the non-physical realms of consciousness. We can use the analogy of a film projector, where there is a film strip recording running through the projector, transmitted through a field of light onto a movie screen. The film recording is the recording of what is occurring in consciousness, transmitted through fields of energy to condense into that which appears in physical reality (the screen). In our physical reality vibration is so slow that there usually appear to be substantial time delays between something coming through our consciousness and a physical reflection of it showing up.\n\nShould we be displeased with what appears on the screen, what can we do about it? We could cut off or paste over part of the screen with some image we desire, however, the projector is still running and will sooner or later project something else over what we have pasted there. We could project another pattern of light within the stream coming from the projector, and this might temporarily change what appears on the screen; however, the power source for our intermediary pattern of light cannot match the spiritual power source of the original projector, so at some point that original projection will become dominant again. Finally, we could meet with the film producer and director to create a new movie that expresses what we would prefer to have on screen. This is where we would examine our own thoughts, beliefs, feelings, values, and priorities, and change our perspective and our pattern of living. This would produce the most lasting change in what appears \u201con-screen\u201d in our life.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nJed Shlackman, M.S.

The first event was all but ignored, aside from President Trump's historic address to the march; the second event was celebrated and glorified and magnified.\n\nThe differences in coverage were so glaring as to be embarrassing. But within the echo chamber of leftist media, the bias is so ingrained that it is not even noticed. And it is hardly anything new.\n\nIn fact, in 1981, professors S. Robert Lichter and Stanley Rothman \"released a groundbreaking survey of 240 journalists at the most influential national media outlets \u2014 including the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Time, Newsweek, U.S. News & World Report, ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS \u2014 on their political attitudes and voting patterns.\" The survey found these \"media elites\" to be shockingly liberal, to the point that \"54 percent did not regard adultery as wrong, compared to only 15 percent [of the general public] who regarded it as wrong.\"\n\nNot only so, but \"90 percent agree that a woman has the right to decide for herself whether to have an abortion; 79 percent agree strongly with this pro-choice position.\" This was in 1981. Little has changed to this day, aside from alternative voices being raised up to combat this one-sided narrative.\n\nFrom 1987-1996, my family lived in Maryland, immediately outside of Washington, DC, and many of our friends were on the front lines of the pro-life movement. One year, a number of us participated in an Operation Rescue event and were arrested at a local abortion clinic. This barely made the news, despite a fairly substantial turnout.\n\nThe next day was the massive March for Life, attended by multiplied tens of thousands of peaceful protestors. And it took place right in our back yard, certainly worthy of local news, not to mention national news. There were also a handful of pro-abortion protestors at the event, but they were outnumbered by 500 or even 1,000 to 1.\n\nThat night we gathered around our TVs to watch the 11:00 PM local news, and there was not a mention of the march until the closing minutes of the broadcast. And this despite the fact that the march was far and away the most momentous local event of the week (or month?), let alone of the day.\n\nAnd how did the stations cover the event? They did not show the massive crowds. Instead, they interviewed a couple of pro-life marchers and a couple of pro-abortion protestors, giving the idea that they were equal in number. We were grieved but not surprised.\n\nNot much has changed today, and if not for President Trump addressing the March for Life, which was participating in the longest-lasting protest march in our nation's history (tragically), it appears there would have been a virtual media blackout of the event.\n\nBut this year, the media were able to display their bias even more dramatically, not just covering the women's march (which included many a staunch pro-abortion feminist) but actually celebrating it.\n\nThe Right Scoop website counted tweets from CNN and CNN Breaking News on both events. The totals?\n\nFor the March for Life, there were zero tweets from CNN's Breaking News and two from CNN's main account, both focusing on the president's address, where, we were told, he touted his \"anti-abortion\" record. In contrast, CNN's Breaking News tweeted 10 timesabout the women's march while CNN's main account tweeted 18 times.\n\nIt's worth looking at the page to see the tweets and pictures for yourself. Talk about shouting out your bias.\n\nBut once again, this is nothing new. One year ago, Newsbusters carried this shocking headline: \"Networks Cover Women's March 129x More Than March for Life.\" Yes, 129 times.\n\nWhat is really tragic is that many people get their news from the liberal media, because of which they have a skewed sense of reality, not even knowing what is taking place in their own nation.\n\nAll the more, then, do we have the responsibility to challenge the integrity of the leftist media, to expose its biases loudly and clearly, and to determine to get the truth out \u2013 sans our own biases \u2013 for the world to hear.\n\nAnd we do this with confidence, not despair, knowing that in the end, truth will always triumph. As the apostle Paul wrote, \"For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth\" (2 Corinthians 13:8).\n\nWho knows? We might even see a shift in media perspectives in our lifetimes.\n\nEngaging views and analysis from outside contributors on the issues affecting society and faith today.\n\nCP VOICES do not necessarily reflect the views of The Christian Post.

Schools can also be birth control providers under the guise of helping girls stay in school and avoid unplanned pregnancies.\n\nThere's plenty of research on the psychological implications of having sex too young. And as Christians we read in the Bible about God's thoughts on the subject, but has anyone researched the long-term medical complications that can occur in young girls receiving high levels of hormones during puberty? Hormones are not innocent drugs. I learned this by experience.\n\nDuring my mom's pregnancy with me, her doctor gave her a new drug that supposedly helped prevent miscarriage. Diethylstibetrol (DES) was a synthetic form of the hormone estrogen. Mom dutifully took it daily throughout her pregnancy and experienced no complications.\n\nThen 16 years later complications arose\u2014not in her, but in me. The DES caused clear cell adenocarcinoma \u2014and cases all over the country were cropping up in other \"DES daughters\".\n\nLess than a decade later, I had a miscarriage, followed by giving birth prematurely at 32 weeks. Why? Deformed uterus caused by DES. Then, six years later, my mom died of breast cancer\u2014DES gave the women who took it a 30 percent increased chance of developing that disease.\n\nFor all of these young girls being given hormone drugs\u2014there may be a cost to pay in the future.

He is the author of 25 books and hosts the nationally syndicated, daily talk radio show, the Line of Fire.\n\nAccording to evangelical Christian leader Johnnie Moore, President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel is a good thing for the Palestinians. According to Rev. Dr. Jack Sara, a Palestinian Christian living in Jerusalem, Moore has seriously missed the mark. In fact, in Sara's view, since Trump's decision was strongly encouraged by evangelical Christians, that very name \u2013 evangelical \u2013 now has a negative connotation among the Palestinian people, making it all the more difficult for the Palestinian Christians living there. What are we to make of these concerns?\n\nSara writes with a gracious tone, saying, \"My critique is from an evangelical perspective and it is a plea to my brethren across the water.\" But he is forthright in his convictions, claiming that the term \"evangelical\" has \"become increasingly despised in our region and that the \"uncritical support of Israel\" by evangelicals \"is blinding their eyes to the injustices committed in the land.\"\n\nHe blames this further on the alleged \"distorted interpretation of Scripture\" held to by evangelicals, asking, \"What is their good news to the Palestinians? What is their Gospel for the Arab nations?\"\n\nWith all respect to Dr. Sara as my brother in the Lord, and having shared with him privately that I'd be responding to his article, allow me to address the issues he raises.\n\nFirst, in 1972, as a weeks-old, Jewish believer in Jesus, the local rabbi gave me a book on anti-Semitism in Church history, outlining one of the major reasons many Jews do not believe in Jesus. Non-baptized Jews were exiled from numerous countries; Jews were slaughtered in the Crusades (including European Jews, whose sin was to be Jewish); Martin Luther counseled that rabbis be forbidden to teach on penalty of death \u2013 and on and on it goes.\n\nAs evil and anti-Christian as the Holocaust was, it found a ready home in anti-Semitic Europe, the result of centuries of \"Christian\" anti-Semitism.\n\nNow, after such a long and ugly history, evangelical Christian love for Israel has won the hearts of many Israelis, and Jewish leaders around the world recognize the sincerity \u2013 even the altruism \u2013 of this love, thereby recovering some of the testimony of Jesus that has been lost.\n\nDr. Sara, can you rejoice with me that this has taken place? Since these are the Messiah's own flesh and blood, the ones for whom Paul agonized (in Romans 9), shouldn't you, as a follower of Jesus be glad? \"Evangelical\" has hardly become a dirty word among Israeli Jews.\n\nSecond, the gospel for the Arab nations is the same as the gospel for the Hindu nations and Buddhist nations \u2013 and for the Jewish people themselves. You can receive forgiveness of your sins through the blood the cross! You can receive a new heart and become a child of God through the death and resurrection of Jesus! Repent and believe!\n\nIsn't that message enough? Why must it also have territorial promises tied in with it?\n\nThird, God did promise the physical land of Israel to the Jewish people before the Law was given at Sinai, and as Paul explained in Galatians 3, the Law, which was 430 years after the promise, cannot nullify the promise. As for the perpetuity of that promise, could God have made Himself any clearer? \"He remembers his covenant forever, the word that he commanded, for a thousand generations, the covenant that he made with Abraham, his sworn promise to Isaac, which he confirmed to Jacob as a statute, to Israel as an everlasting covenant, saying, 'To you I will give the land of Canaan as your portion for an inheritance.'\" (Ps. 105:8-11)\n\nYou might say, \"But that's not fair.\"\n\nMay I ask you, dear brother, why everyone else gets a homeland but the Jewish people don't get one, even a tiny one in the Middle East? If my calculations are right, the physical land of Israel constitutes roughly 1/650th of the surrounding Arab and Muslim land. Is it so terrible that we Jews have a homeland?\n\nFourth, when there was plenty of room for Jews and Arabs to dwell side by side in what was then called Palestine in the 1930s, the Muslim leadership was offered a two-state solution. The Jewish leadership accepted the offer; the Muslim leadership refused.\n\nThe same thing happened in 1947. The Jewish leadership accepted the two-state solution, echoing the sentiments of David Ben Gurion, who said in 1937, \"We do not wish and do not need to expel Arabs and take their place. All our aspiration is built on the assumption \u2013 proven throughout all our activity in the Land of Israel \u2013 that there is enough room in the country for ourselves and the Arabs.\"\n\nThe Muslim leadership refused, calling for war instead. In the words of Azzam Pasha, Secretary-General of the Arab League, October 11, 1947, \"It will be a war of annihilation. It will be a momentous massacre in history that will be talked about like the massacres of the Mongols or the Crusades.\"\n\nIsn't that still the attitude of Hamas, rightly branded a terrorist group by America? And isn't it true that the Palestinian Authority (PA) still rewards the families of terrorists who slaughter Israeli children, women, and men? And isn't it true that, the vast majority of Israel's 1.5 million Arab citizens prefer living under Israeli rule rather than under the rule of Hamas or the PA?\n\nPerhaps Israel is not the primary cause of Palestinian suffering? Perhaps the greater cause is the Palestinian Muslim leadership?\n\nFifth, if I follow your logic, then the only way Palestinians will be happy with evangelical Christians is if we renounce reality and say that Jerusalem is not the capital of Israel, when in fact it is the capital, both in history and at present. Conversely, as you surely know, Jerusalem has never been the capital of a Palestinian state. Why, now, must E. Jerusalem be the capital of Palestine? Based on what criteria?\n\nUnfortunately, as noted by one pro-Israel blogger, you are basically stating \"that without antisemitism, the Arabs won't listen to the message of Christ.\" In other words, unless Christians worldwide take an anti-Israel position and refuse to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Muslims won't receive the gospel. Dr. Sara, do you really believe this?\n\nThe good news is that, around the world, not only are Muslims coming to Jesus in unprecedented numbers, but many of them are becoming staunch lovers of Israel, recognizing that it is Satan who wants to destroy the Jewish people and that Jew-hatred is all too present in Islamic tradition.\n\nOn a recent trip to Germany, I met some former Muslims from Iran and Turkey and Syria. We hugged and rejoiced together, as they told me in their imperfect English how much they loved Jesus and how much they loved the Jews. This is but one anecdotal example out of countless thousands.\n\nI know some Palestinian Christians who feel the same way, yet they have been beaten and threatened by their Muslim neighbors because of their pro-Israel stance.\n\nPerhaps, Dr. Sara, they are not all reading the Bible wrongly? Perhaps they recognize that, as surely as God is God, His love for Israel remains the same, despite our many sins (Romans 11:28-29)?\n\nSixth, I do not minimize injustices you and your friends may have suffered, and I do not believe Israel is faultless, not historically and not today. I do my best to address areas of concerns when my Jewish brothers fall short, so yes, we are joined together in Jesus to stand for justice. Where I have a blind spot to these injustices, by all means, help me to see more clearly.\n\nI simply appeal to you to reconsider your understanding of the Scriptures when it comes to Israel, to ask yourself if your bad experiences have blinded your eyes to the plain teaching of the Bible, and to do what the Lord enjoined in the Psalms and in Isaiah (Psalm 22 and Isaiah 62), namely, to pray for a Jewish Jerusalem to become the praise of all the earth.\n\nLet the discussion continue.\n\nEngaging views and analysis from outside contributors on the issues affecting society and faith today.\n\nCP VOICES do not necessarily reflect the views of The Christian Post.

Go ahead, and test your knowledge.\n\nCan Christianity be proven? Contrary to popular belief that the Christian faith is based on unproven assumptions, there is actually a great deal of evidence for the Christian worldview. This is a 12 point reasoning process, in extremely short form, indicating a reasoning route beginning at \"Can truth be known?\"\n\n1. Truth about reality is knowable.\n\na. The phrase \"all truth is relative\" actually contradicts itself, the statement is making an objective claim while at the same time suggesting that all ideas must be relative. That is an obvious contradiction. (Road-runner tactic)\n\nb. All sorts of facts are knowable, such as: mathematics, history, science, rules of logic, finances, and systems of law. The whole world functions on objective truths; philosophy and religion don't become \"relative\" just because it's intellectually convenient.\n\nc. We don't need absolute proof to take action, we only need proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n2. The law of non-contradictionindicates that what is opposite of true must be false.\n\n3. It is true that a theistic God exists.\n\na. The fine tuning of the universe proves God exists\n\nb. The fact of a cosmic beginning shows that God exists\n\nc. The order and design in nature and human DNA proves that God exists\n\nd. The reality of good and evil and objective morality proves that God exists\n\ne. Only an infinite God with infinite power could create the universe, time, space and humanity. Aninfinite God is singular, in that multiple gods could not all be infinite, only one God is needed, an infinite God, therefore God must be a theistic God, one God.\n\n4. If God exists then miracles are possible.\n\na. An infinite God can interact within the universe He created in any way he desires, so miracles are not a problem for this theistic God.\n\n5. Miracles are useful as evidence and confirmation of a message from God.\n\n6. The Bible is historically reliable.\n\na. Over 5,000 manuscripts validate the Bible as unaltered and historically reliable\n\nb. Archaeological evidence agrees with biblical descriptions of history.\n\nc. Respected ancient historians cite facts that match with the biblical narrative\n\n7. The New Testament says that Jesus claimed to be God.\n\na. \"I and the Father are one.\" \u2013John 10:30 ESV\n\nb. Jesus said to them, \"Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am.\" \u2013John 8:58 ESV\n\nc. \"So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.\" \u2013Mark 2:28 NIV\n\n8. Jesus' claim to be God was miraculously confirmed by:\n\na. His fulfillment of many prophecies about himself\n\nb. His sinless and miraculous life\n\nc. His crucifixion and resurrection\n\n9. Therefore, Jesus is God.\n\n10. Whatever Jesus (Who is God) teaches must be true.\n\na. If Jesus Christ is God, then anything Jesus teaches must be absolutely true, given the requirements for God include infinite knowledge, infinite ability, moral purity, and a living embodiment of the truth.\n\n11. Jesus taught that the Bible is the word of God.\n\na. \"For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished,\" Matt. 5:18 NASB\n\nb. \"The Scripture cannot be broken\" \u2013John 10:35b NASB\n\nc. \"Your word is truth\" \u2013John 17:17b NASB\n\n12. Therefore it is true that the Bible is the word of God.\n\nIf Jesus Christ is really God, then the Bible must be the word of God, because Jesus considered the Bible the word of God. Given these 12 points, Christianity is true beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nHow should you respond? First step, do more research. Second step, think about it. Third step, actually pray about it and ask God to reveal himself to you.\n\nFrom a basis of imperative (necessity) the greatest question of life itself must be: How can we overcome death? The clock is after all ticking for all of us. Well, there is only one who has successfully overcome death.\n\nDid Jesus Christ really rise from the dead? If Jesus Christ really did rise from the dead, then he can do the same for us, as God, and for that reason, eternal life, the holy grail itself becomes available to us!\n\nIf the reasoning is sound, and you've come to believe that these facts are true, then commit your life to Jesus Christ, commit to serve Him and live by his standards put forth in the New Testament. And you will live forever. It's as simple as that. Believe on Jesus Christ, believe God raised him from the dead, and commit your way to his teachings. If the goal is to believe what is actually true, then you ought to believe Christianity.\n\nNote: The 12points discussed are drawn from Dr. Norman Geisler and Frank Turek's book I Don't Have Enough Faith to be an Atheist.

(Reuters/KYODO)\n\nThe news consistently reminds us that we are not the captains of our fate. For instance, a 7.9 magnitude earthquake off the southern coast of Alaska early this morning has prompted fearsof a tsunami that could reach the West Coast. Despite all our scientific advances, humans are no match for the power of nature.\n\nA new study suggests that the Black Death, a plague that killed 30 to 60 percent of Europe's population, was caused not by fleas spread on rats but by human fleas and body lice.

Patriots defensive tackle Adam Butler responded: \"Be humble or be humbled.\" We now know which transpired.\n\nA life of humility\n\nEvangelist Luis Palau is one of the godliest and most gracious men I have ever met. His sparkling wit and infectious passion for Jesus have attracted millions of people to our Lord.\n\nHe has spoken to thirty million people in seventy-five countries across his ministry, authored dozens of books, and been featured in radio broadcasts on 3,500 radio outlets in forty-eight countries. When he preached at the last church I pastored, his message exalted Jesus in a way I will never forget.\n\nNow he has announced that he has Stage 4 lung cancer. \"Everything is ready and if the Lord wants to take me home in the next few months or two years or whatever it is, I'm ready,\" he said in a video I hope you'll watch today.\n\nOne of the most impactful attributes of Rev. Palau's life and ministry is his genuine humility. He believes passionately that his salvation and ministry are God's gifts of grace. He points people to Jesus rather than himself because he knows our souls need not a man but the Master.\n\nI recently read this statement from Charles Spurgeon: \"The more thou hast, the more thou art in debt to God; and thou shouldst not be proud of that which renders thee a debtor.\"\n\nThe priority of humility\n\nC. J. Mahaney is the author of Humility: True Greatness. This pastor's insightful description of the biblical path from pride to humility is transformational reading. I was given a copy of his book recently and profited from it greatly.\n\nMahaney begins with God's promise from Isaiah 66:2: \"This is the one to whom I will look: he who is humble and contrite in spirit and trembles at my word.\" This promise causes him to note that \"humility draws the gaze of our Sovereign God.\"\n\nJust as our humility honors God, the converse is true: honoring God leads to humility. Mahaney quotes John Calvin: \"It is evident that man never attains to a true self-knowledge until he has previously contemplated the face of God, and come down after such contemplation to look into himself.\" Calvin's observation leads to Mahaney's definition: \"Humility is honestly assessing ourselves in light of God's holiness and our sinfulness.\"\n\nChoosing humility involves the following theological commitments:\n\n\u2022 View pride as \"the essence of all sin\" (John Stott) and \"an abomination to the Lord\" (Proverbs 16:5).\n\n\u2022 Remember that \"God opposes the proud\" (James 4:6; 1 Peter 5:5) because our pride contends with his sovereignty.\n\n\u2022 Define greatness as serving others for the glory of God: \"Whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be slave of all\" (Mark 10:43-44).\n\n\u2022 Ask God to rescue you from pride, depending on the One who \"came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many\" (Matthew 20:28).\n\nThe path to humility\n\nNext, Mahaney offers several practical steps toward humility. The first and most important is to reflect often on the wonder of the cross, beginning your day by acknowledging your dependence on God and your need for God.\n\nHe quotes John Stott: \"Nothing in history or in the universe cuts us down to size like the cross. All of us have inflated views of ourselves, especially in self-righteousness, until we have visited a place called Calvary. It is there, at the foot of the cross, that we shrink to our true size.\"\n\nNow begin your day by expressing gratefulness to God. Spend time in the spiritual disciplines of prayer, Bible study, and worship. Memorize Scripture, especially on your commute or during what Mahaney calls \"mundane moments.\" Cast your cares upon Jesus (1 Peter 5:6-7), as this will cause you to realize your need for your Lord. And end your day by expressing gratitude to God for his grace and for the gift of sleep.\n\nThere's much more in Mahaney's wonderful exposition. That's why I hope you'll read it and apply its truths personally.\n\nThe mystery of humility\n\nFaith does not exempt us from the peril of pride. Mahaney quotes John Owen's warning: \"There is no duty we perform for God that sin does not oppose. And the more spirituality or holiness there is in what we do, the greater is its enmity to it. Thus, those who seek the most for God experience the strongest opposition.\"\n\nThe more you serve Jesus, the more opposition you will face, but the more you will experience his abundant life (John 10:10). And the closer you get to God, the farther away you will realize you are.\n\nThat's the challenge, the joy, and the mystery of humility.\n\nFirst published at the Denison Forum.\n\nAdapted from Dr. Jim Denison's daily cultural commentary at www.denisonforum.org .

The good news is, it is simply not true!\n\nThat's according to a fascinating new book, \"Religion vs. Science: What Religious People Really Think,\" by Elaine Howard Ecklund of Rice University and Christopher Scheitle of West Virginia University. As reported in Christianity Today, Ecklund and Scheitle found that, based on data from a nationally representative survey of 10,000 Americans, evangelicals are just as likely as most Americans to count scientists as close friends\u2014but they tend to assume their friends are the exceptions, that most scientists want nothing to do with them.\n\nAnd while only 40 percent of all scientists say they believe in God, and about half have no religious affiliation, Ecklund and Scheitle found that a full 65 percent of those working in practical scientific fields such as medicine and engineering identify as Christians, including 24 percent as evangelicals.\n\nApparently there's a link between faith traditions that emphasize helping other people and the kinds of professions that actually do so\u2014who knew? Down through the centuries, of course, Christians have been eager to help the sick and many of us have taken to heart God's call to be His stewards in the world, caring for and developing His creation, so these figures are no surprise.\n\nWe're not doing quite as well in the basic and more theoretical sciences, however. Ecklund and Scheitle suspect there isn't as strong a connection between our religious values and basic science, observing, \"[I]t would be easier to see 'new medical discoveries' as spiritually connected to the ideals of faith than it would be to see 'new scientific discoveries' as promoting faith ideas.\"\n\nBut of course the connection between scientific discovery and a Christian worldview is as strong as an electric current running through water. Years ago, Chuck Colson reminded us that many of the great scientists of history\u2014Copernicus in astronomy and Newton in physics, among them\u2014made epochal discoveries while operating out of a Christian worldview.\n\nThat worldview says that God created the universe out of nothing, that He has set up a series of observable, rational laws to govern it, and that mankind\u2014male and female\u2014has been created in His image with the God-given ability to discover things about the physical world and bring order and blessing to it. As the eminent historian Rodney Stark has written, \"Christian theology was necessary for the rise of science.\" Indeed!\n\nYes, sometimes certain modern scientific trends and spokespeople have anti-religious agendas. But let's never fear the battle, remembering that when we engage in science, we are firmly on our heavenly Father's home turf.\n\nEcklund and Scheitle, for their part, suggest that our churches should take a more active role in recognizing and promoting science as a calling from God. They say that the church needs \"faith leaders to celebrate the scientists within their congregations, and they need these scientists to speak out about how scientific knowledge is not a threat to their faith.\"\n\nSo while the rift between science and faith may have been greatly exaggerated, we still have some work to do.\n\nScientists and Christianity: It's not What You May Think\n\nScientific pursuit and faith in Christ are not mutually exclusive, as Eric has pointed out.

Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\" (Matthew 19:23,24)\n\nWhy then do you suppose God allows so much affluence, given how dangerous the love of money and the pursuit of materialism is to a person's soul? Jesus cut to the chase by asking, \"What does it profit a man to gain the whole world, and yet lose his own soul?\" (Mark 8:36)\n\nAnd yet in spite of the solemn risk, throngs of people seem willing to give anything in exchange for loads of money and a ton of possessions. Jesus addressed this pitfall by declaring what has become a well-known biblical principle: \"You cannot serve both God and money.\" (Matthew 6:24)\n\nThe apostle Paul expressed the danger this way: \"People who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.\" (1 Timothy 6:9,10)\n\nNevertheless, God has given man the option to pursue a life of extravagance and riches. Ultimately, it is a test of one's allegiance. Will I choose to worship created things, or the Creator Himself?\n\nThe Bible describes how centuries ago people \"exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator - who is forever praised.\" (Romans 1:25) The same error goes on all the time today.\n\nYou assume that you own your things, when in reality, they may very well be owning you. And so it's no surprise that \"the abundance of a rich man permits him no sleep.\" (Eccl. 5:12)\n\nWhen you worship things, you are left high and dry; whereas when you worship your Creator, you engage in an activity that will take place in heaven forever. And while the joy and contentment of paradise will never end, the person who loves money and worships wealth will have a far different experience throughout eternity.\n\nAs you look at your life today, ask yourself this question: \"Am I consumed by the love of God and a desire to help others know Christ, or by the love of money and the obsession to get rich?\" No heart is capable of being consumed by both of those goals at the same time because they are polar opposites. And at the end of the day, \"A man is a slave to whatever has mastered him.\" (2 Peter 2:19)\n\nThe wisdom of Solomon revealed this fact: \"Whoever loves money never has money enough; whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with his income.\" (Ecclesiastes 5:10) In other words, those who chase after riches dig a bottomless pit for themselves.\n\nNo wonder Jesus spent most of His earthly ministry reaching out to the poor, rather than hobnobbing with rich folks. Remember that it was Christ who said, \"When you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed.\" (Luke 14:13,14)\n\nNearly one-half of the world's population live on less than $2.50 a day. Meanwhile, there are scores of people on the planet who adhere to Warren Buffett's famous admonition: \"Rule No. 1: Never lose money. Rule No. 2: Don't forget rule No. 1.\"\n\nNow compare that worldview to what Christ said concerning man's immortal soul. You could sum up the Lord's approach to money and eternity this way: \"Rule No. 1: Never lose your soul. Rule No. 2: Don't forget rule No. 1.\"\n\nIt has been 2600 years since the prophet Daniel was given profound spiritual insight into future events. Daniel wrote, \"Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt. Those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness like the stars forever and ever.\" (Daniel 12:2,3)\n\nAnd so the question remains: With eternity hanging in the balance, why does God allow so much affluence?\n\nWhile we may not have all the answers to this puzzling question, Scripture does reveal why God sent His only Son to be sacrificed on the cross. \"God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.\" (John 3:16)\n\nThe wealth of this world is pitiful and paltry when compared to the glorious riches of Christ and His eternal kingdom. I guess that leaves each one of us with a monumental decision in front of us. And the stakes couldn't be any higher.\n\nDan Delzell is the pastor of Wellspring Church in Papillion, Neb.

I am frustrated with the President's and Congress's games and excuses while hardworking men and women (many of whom put their lives on the line every day) will suffer because they won't do their jobs.\n\nIn the ongoing news cycle of discouraging situations one after another, how do we as followers of Christ respond? God often uses the following five biblical truths to remind me Who's in control when life seems out of control.\n\nI had you all along. God won't fail us. He promises us this in Hebrews 13:5, \"I will never leave you nor forsake you\" (ESV). He is active in every part of our lives and our family's lives. I am working. In John 5:17 Jesus said, \"My Father is working until now, and I am working.\" Every part of our lives is important to God and He is always working in our lives even when we don't see evidence. The Bible is full of examples of God working through and in spite of the craziness of the world. Jesus' life is the perfect example. Only Mary, Joseph, Elizabeth, and Zacharias knew Who He was and His purpose for coming to earth. Jesus dealt with persecution from His own people, the Roman government, and the religious leaders. From the outside it seemed His life was discouraging and off-track at times, but all along God was working His plan. You have not missed anything. If there is one message that social media preaches louder than any other, it is this\u2014You are missing out! It has been given a name\u2014FOMO (fear of missing out). It is the job of social media to convince you that you are missing out so you better stay connected online at all times. When current events bring uncertainty, the temptation is to be glued to whatever medium we use for the news. We look to others' social media posts to give us insights and comfort, assuming they have the inside scoop. But the truth is only God knows all. He will tell us what we need to know when we need to know it. 2 Peter 1:3, \"I can pray this because His divine power has bestowed on us everything necessary for life and godliness through the rich knowledge of the one who called us by his own glory and excellence\" (NET). We need to be alert and listening to Him. I am not holding out on you. We want what we want and we want it now. We are basically two-year-olds. But the truth is if what we want would be good for us, God would make sure we had it and now. Psalm 84:11, \"For the LORD God is a sun and shield; the LORD bestows favor and honor. No good thing does He withhold from those who walk uprightly\" (ESV). When we don't understand what God is up to, we must make a decision\u2014to acknowledge God as our sovereign LORD, trusting Him; or not to trust Him because He has not shown us \"the big plan.\" Faith trusts. Disbelief demands answers. I have given you all you need. We live in a country where we can get hot coffee on any street corner and order an item online and it will be delivered within an hour, two days at the most. We have news and entertainment literally at our fingertips. Yet, we live with the scarcity mentality\u2014there's not enough for me. Through Moses' life God shows us, \"I have given you all you need.\" Throughout his life, God communicated with Moses in a way Moses could hear. Moses leaned in and listened to God and then did what God told him to do. Throughout his life, God provided for Moses and the Hebrews by giving them manna and keeping their clothes from wearing out. God will give us what we need as we need it. We only need to listen and look for it. Enjoy Today. Life is a process. Life does not consist of many easy days strung together with a hard one every so often. Each day provides its own challenges. Jesus told us as much, \"So then, do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Today has enough trouble of its own\" (Matthew 6:34, NET). Our pastor recently reminded us that Jesus has today taken care of; so I can enjoy today. Enjoying today requires that I am present in the moments and not rushing through to get to the end of the day. It means I acknowledge and thank God for all I call good in my life\u2014my family, friends, home, our church, work, etc. Today and all the blessings it brings are a gift from God. I can enjoy them even when I don't have answers or power to change the crazy in our country.\n\nYes, we have the responsibility to participate in our government\u2014vote, call your Congressperson, pray for our leaders. But remember that ultimately it is God Who directs the leaders' hearts (Proverbs 21:1). And because of this we have peace.\n\nFor more on trusting God in the crazy times, check out Brenda's short video, What God Wished I Knew.

Blockchain Stocks Are Next!\n\nBy Matt Agorist\n\nSchaumburg, IL \u2014 In a testament as to how the world is rejecting the war on cannabis and, instead, embracing its incredible medicinal properties, an Illinois court has just ruled that an 11-year-old girl will be able to treat her seizures with cannabis \u2014 while at school.\n\nNothing highlights the hypocrisy, immorality, and sheer idiocy of the drug war quite like marijuana prohibition. Here we have a medicine that kills cancer cells, saves the lives of countless epileptic children, heals broken bones, relieves pain, treats PTSD, is not dangerous, and exhibits a variety of other incredible benefits \u2013 yet the state will kill you over it. The good news is, however, that in spite of the reefer madness maniacs tightening their grip on the drug war, people are resisting and the effects are saving lives \u2014 Ashley Surin is one of them.\n\nWhen she was much younger, Ashley found herself in a battle for her life as leukemia took over. Thankfully, she won that battle but not without consequences. As a result of the chemotherapy, Ashley developed seizures.\n\nLuckily for Ashley, however, medical marijuana helped to drastically decrease those seizures.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re amazed with her progress,\u201d Maureen Surin, Ashley\u2019s mother told NPR. There was a catch, however, in treating Ashley\u2019s seizures with cannabis \u2014 she couldn\u2019t go to school \u2014 because it was illegal.\n\nAshley\u2019s family wasn\u2019t going down without a fight though and this week, in a landmark ruling, she won that fight.\n\nAs NPR reports, her parents filed a lawsuit in federal court on Wednesday against Schaumburg School District 54 and the State of Illinois, claiming that the state\u2019s ban on taking the drug at school violates the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). On Friday, a judge ruled in their favor after hearing from the school district, which reportedly had concerns that its employees may be subject to legal penalties for helping Ashley with her medications.\n\n[More\u2026]\n\nPhilosophers stone \u2013 selected views from the boat http://philosophers-stone.co.uk\n\nSource: http://www.phoenixisrisen.co.uk/?p=15834", "domain": "beforeitsnews.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://beforeitsnews.com/alternative/2018/01/paradigm-shift-court-rules-11yo-girl-can-treat-her-seizures-with-cannabis-in-school-2-3590353.html"}

Whether it\u2019s plastic pollution, pricey artificial imports or simple nostalgia for the real thing, everywhere sales of live pines, spruce, firs and hemlock are climbing. And why not? Christmas tree farming is environmentally sound. The stands, often on land little suited for anything else, provide a welcoming habitat for vast array of wildlife as well as employment in areas where such opportunities are often scarce on the ground. Cut-your-own operations not only offer an additional source of revenue to tree farmers but to surrounding communities where the visitors stop to shop. Once home, they bring joy and happiness before finally ending their days biodegraded as municipal mulch.\n\nThe same cannot be said for the competition. The pollution caused by plastics has reached down almost to the point of politicians taking practical steps to reduce the menace. Nor to these ersatz imitations offer much in the way of local employment. China yes, and the contaminating container ships that deliver them en masse to further shores. And surely there is nothing more ironic than communist China not recognizing religion but profiting from a major event of Christianity? So you\u2019ll never have to buy another tree? Think again\u2014artificial trees last an average of six years before ending up in landfill. What tree to purchase? Visit local lots and you\u2019ll most likely be limited to the two or three species most popular in your neck of the woods. These could be White spruce, White pine, Scotch pine, Virginia pine, Hemlock (Balsam fir), Douglas fir, Fraser Fir, or Noble fir. Any and all may have taken up to 10 years to reach the desired six to seven feet in height. A word of warning, however: potted Picea are not environmentally practical. They may tolerate a week or so in the home but then must be planted outside. Is your yard large enough to support what, in the case of a white spruce (P. glauca), become a hundred-foot conifer? Where will next year\u2019s tree go? And the next one . . . and the next . . . and the next? Fun Facts and Figures: Canadian Christmas Trees: valued at over $50 million annually; more than 1,700,000 trees were exported to the US\u2014half from Quebec.\n\nCanadian Christmas Tree Farms: almost 2,400 for a total of over 28,000 hectares\n\nBig Business: in the US, 25 to 30 million trees are sold annually from about 15,000 farms, worth about $1 billion.\n\nTallest Christmas Tree: to date 73 metres (238 feet) artificial tree at Galle Face Green, Colombo, Sri Lanka; a 67.36m (221ft) Douglas fir at Northgate Shopping Center, Seattle holds the record for the real thing according to Guinness World Records\n\nWorse Christmas Tree: many claims but to date, Cardiff, Wales leads the pack with an artificial tree\n\nHow Old Are Christmas Trees? First printed reference is from German inn 1531\n\nFirst Decorated Christmas Tree? Riga and Tallinn, the capitals of Latvia and Estonia, have waged a feud over which was the site of the world\u2019s first decorated Christmas tree, according to The New York Times. Answer: Riga in 1510\n\nChristmas Tree Lights: first mass-produced 1890 after being thought up eight years earlier by Edward Johnson, assistant to Thomas Edison\n\nToilet Brush Trees: US Addis Brush Company first made artificial trees in 1930 with brush bristles died green\n\nWorse Christmas Song: O Christmas Tree is rated the second worse seasonal song, although the original German song O Tannebaum doesn\u2019t refer to Christmas: but to fir trees as a whole (The worse is I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus).\n\nWes Porter is a horticultural consultant and writer based in Toronto.

The trifecta concurrence is well on its way.\n\nFor those who do not know this is something that happens when a series of three cosmic events happen together. This being the full moon to come on the 31st of January. For those who do not know that specific full moon is going to be a blue moon, a blood moon, and a supermoon. No, I am not joking, this is something that has not happened in over 100 years.\n\nBreaking Down the Trifecta:\n\nBlue Moon\n\nA blue moon is probably the easiest of these three to explain. It is simply what we call the second full moon of any given month. For instance, if there were more than one full moon in say, October the second full moon would be referred to as a blue moon. No, a blue moon is not actually blue for anyone who may be wondering.\n\nA blood moon is a term used to refer to a total lunar eclipse. This is because the fully eclipsed moon will, for the most part, appear reddish in color. While a lunar eclipse is not as intense as a solar eclipse it is much easier on the eyes. It happens when the Moon travels through the Earth\u2019s umbra. That being said, the moon does not ever technically turn completely black during the ordeal.\n\nA supermoon is something that happens when the full moon coincides with the moon\u2019s closest approach to Earth in its orbit. Supermoons make the moon itself appear bigger and brighter even though it has not technically changed at all. The term supermoon is relatively new as it has only been used in the past 40 years.\n\nYou see, the super blue blood moon to come is going to be something quite interesting, to say the least. The energies this full moon will bring are going to be like nothing we have experienced before. I suggest taking the time to ensure your personal energies are protected and then sitting back to see the magic of this event.

True they will be fleeting visitors, but their sojourn can be prolonged with a little of the proverbial tender loving care. Bulbs are amazingly thirsty. Check twice a day. Position in bright light and keep as cool as possible. Avoid radiators or hot air vents. Flower stems will continue to elongate, and some support may be required. When the blooms fade, trim back their stalks but retain the foliage. Keep watering until the leaves fade, then allow to dry and store in a cool, dry place until they can be planted out in the garden.

Created by the Christian media ministry Anchored North, this production gives every appearance of being just another \"coming out\" story by a lesbian woman.\n\nEmily Thomes tells of how it \"went terribly\" when she revealed her first romantic relationship with a woman to her father. In her Southern lilt, she describes the conviction at age twenty that if anyone in the Bible Belt was truly a Christian, they would approve of her lifestyle. \"If not,\" she says, \"then you were legalistic and you needed to re-read what God was really about: 'Judge not.'\"\n\nThen, at twenty-two, Thomes was invited to attend a ladies' Bible study. Certain the women would reject her, she gave it the old college try. But something strange happened. Thomes was not shunned by these Christian women. As a result, she began asking herself questions: \"What if it's all true? Are you sure this is who you are?\"\n\nShe turned to the Bible to see if her ideas about what real Christians believe were accurate, and soon found herself in the sin list of 1 Corinthians 6. Paul's promise of judgement, she says, scared her. \"I realized I was in the 'will not enter the kingdom of God' lineup.\" And then she read verse 11: \"And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified.\"\n\nThe freedom promised in this verse ultimately opened her eyes. \"I could hold onto my sin and reject God,\" she says, \"or I could turn to Him. All the debt that I racked up living like I had lived didn't have to be mine...\"\n\nPredictably, HuffPo slams Thomes' story as a commercial for the \"scientifically discredited and flat-out lethal idea that gay, lesbian, or bisexual people can change their sexual orientation if they pray hard enough.\" They quote one so-called \"queer Christian writer and pastor\" who insists \"a robust, Christ-centered\" theology teaches that God accepts every lifestyle, that He is \"all gracious, all merciful, and extends forgiveness and love to absolutely everyone.\"\n\nThe irony is that Thomes would agree that God extends forgiveness and love to all. The difference is that her idea of forgiveness involves repentance, and being born again.\n\nPeople regularly confront her with the refrain of the LGBT movement: \"I was born this way.\" Her reply? \"Yeah, me too. You're not born with right affections. That's why Jesus had to come. You're feeling a desire for sin just proves you need grace like me.\"\n\nThis answer is more than just a good one. It's the definitive response from a Christian worldview to those who insist sexual desires define them.\n\nWhat Thomes' story so beautifully portrays and what proves to be such a stumbling block to the editorial staff at the Huffington Post is a little something called the Gospel. It's the same message preached by other disciples called out of the gay lifestyle, like Rosaria Butterfield, who no longer identify themselves by their desires, but in Christ.\n\nSecular news outlets want to associate this with so-called \"conversion therapy,\" the once popular practice of trying to clinically \"cure\" homosexuality. But as Thomes says, the transformation we undergo in Christ isn't from gay to straight. Despite being happily married in the Lord today, she reminds viewers that \"God calls us not to heterosexuality but to holiness.\"\n\nThe central lie of the LGBT movement and the sexual revolution is that our sin and our desire for it are our identity\u2014even something in which to take pride. But the good news of Christianity is that in Jesus, we can have a new identity. We need no longer be enslaved to our fallen passions.

I am not one of those who would consider myself to have had phenomenal success in the ministry--by most metrics. We did not grow exponentially and send out a dozen missionaries and pastors. We have grown. We have shrunk. We have grown again.\n\nI have had discontent individuals complain over the fact that our church did not have enough elderly members, not enough programs, an unpaved parking lot, that I did not dress nicely enough, that my wife looks too young, there are too many kids, that there are not enough kids, that we sing too many old hymns, that we do not sing enough old hymns, and so on. There seems to be no shortage of illegitimate reasons why people leave a local church in which they are truly loved, pastored, and held up in prayer.\n\nWhen members leave for unbiblical reasons, the faithful pastor has to fight the unsanctified tendency to envy the churches around me that appear to be more successful on account of their attendance. The faithful pastor is tempted to sometimes too quickly label other pastors as \"wolves,\" \"sellouts,\" or \"ear-itchers.\"\n\nThe faithful pastor has to listen to all kinds of suggestions from people in the church about what they think would make the church grow with discernment and the consensus of the eldership without attempting everything or rejecting everything. The faithful pastor has to preach the gospel to himself regularly and remember that it is ultimately God who grows the church. As a dear friend and pastor once told me after a church split, \"Chris, God did not call you to be successful; He called you to be faithful.\"\n\nNo matter the size of the church you attend, your pastor is always aware that there are bigger churches. He is assaulted and accused by the evil one, and he struggles with the balance between viewing himself as both the sinner and the child of God. He often wonders whether the church would be better off with another pastor, but loves the congregation too much to leave.\n\nYour pastor probably will never tell you many of the things that he struggles with internally because he doesn't want to discourage you. You need to know he has thought about quitting everything and taking up a secular job. You need to know that he feels the sting of betrayal when someone leaves the church. You need to know that he weeps when the sheep bite and run away.\n\nYou need to know these things in order to know how to encourage your pastor. You cannot force people to stay, but you can keep yourself from contributing to the pastor's sorrow. These things will also make you a better servant of the Kingdom of God.\n\nIf you are a member of a church, take a good look around at the churches in your area. Talk to pastors, visit services, and focus on the major elements. Is the theology sound? Is the preaching consistent? Are they organized by scriptural principles regarding leadership, church membership, and discipline? Be critical in your search, but be expedient, and set your roots. Here are six things to keep in mind before you decide to leave a local congregation:\n\n1. Be in the church. First, this means to actually attend services. When the doors are open, and it is possible for you to be there, be there. Secondly, it means being in the church, dedicated and emotionally attached. Are there difficult people in the church? That's a wonderful opportunity for you to treat them with the love of Christ!\n\nAre there old hymns you do not know? Wonderful! You can examine the theology of those hymns and learn while you try to sing. Are there little children that get bored and distracted during the sermon? Great! You now have tiny souls that you are reminded to pray for and you have opportunity to encourage parents as they raise their children in the faith. Examine yourself with a flood lamp and your pastor with a candle.\n\n2. Do not be concerned with other local churches. This goes two ways. Do not be consumed with how awful some churches in your area appear, and do not be consumed with how great other churches seem to be. While not absolutely the same, there is roughly a parallel between the relationship of the church and that of marriage. Looking around and comparing your spouse to other people you know is fatal.\n\nOne of the best lessons we can learn from Song of Solomon is the way in which the spouses are instant with songs of praise for the other. God put you in a particular church at this time and it will only be destructive to be \"browsing.\" When other gospel-preaching churches are growing in your area, praise God for working in them, and return to serving the local congregation to which you have committed. Resist the urge to nurture the thought, \"Would I be happier if I were there?\" The grass only looks greener over there. You almost certainly cannot see the thorns.\n\n3. Bloom where you are planted. God put you there to serve him, to grow, glorify His name, and be an ambassador for His kingdom. Ask not what your church can do for you, but what you can do for your church.\n\n4. Do not idolize the \"internet pastor.\" By all means, listen to the sermons of great men. Read books by gifted theologians and pastors. Find ministries that are doctrinally sound and glean from them. But remember, those men do not know you, they do not pray for you, they will not visit you when you are sick or on the brink of a divorce. Your pastor may not be as brilliant or eloquent, but a big part of it is that he is spending his time tending the flock while the theologian is reading and writing. Your pastor is aware that he is not Charles Spurgeon.\n\n5. Do not leave lightly. After someone leaves a congregation on account of discontentment, there is a stall in the growth of the saints--especially for the pastor. Your pastor has been praying for you, preparing spiritual meals for you, and striving to serve you. Even if you leave and another person comes, he will feel the pain of your departure. Keep in mind that when a congregant leaves because of unbiblical discontentment, your pastor will be tempted to start believing that he is unfit for ministry. There is not a scriptural precedence for leaving a true church, and I am convinced that it is sin to leave for reasons other than moving, church-planting, or significant and clear biblical reasons.\n\n6. If you do move on from a particular congregation, leave in peace. It is always a temptation for a departing person or family to try to take the best with them. This is divisiveness and sinful. Unless the church you left is a full-blown cult teaching heresy, do not poach sheep. You sin against Christ's bride by luring others away. If you are leaving for legitimate reasons, be honest with your elders about those reasons, but be tactful and brief if you must explain to others so that you do not sow seeds of discord.\n\nI understand the appeal of reliving that church honeymoon period where everyone is nice to you and whatever work you do is thoroughly applauded. I believe Satan's most effective tactic is often to keep Christians impotent by moving them from church to church. When he does, there is perpetual delay to the work to which they once belonged. Your pastor does his best work when he is encouraged by the spiritual growth and commitment of the saints.\n\nI pray that God presses these things upon your heart in such a way that you can best serve Him in His church. To God be the glory.\n\nChris Marley is the pastor of Miller Valley Baptist Church in Prescott, AZ.

The author, a young woman named Gabrielle Ulubay, shared intimate details about her recent experiences with casual sex after the first date. She was thoughtful, honest, genuine...and completely, utterly lost.\n\nI'm ashamed to admit that for far too many years my attitude towards opinion pieces like this was less than charitable. I'd find annoyance in what I saw as poor counsel from the author and would seethe with frustration at any serious publication that helped promote it.\n\nBut truthfully, Ms. Ulubay is doing the best she can \u2013 and I wouldn't hesitate to say that's far better than I would be doing without the saving relationship I found in Christ.\n\nThink about it. She's a graduate of a prestigious university and is being published by the New York Times. She exudes compassion, an earnestness to do the right thing herself, and help others do the same. As a hopefully maturing Christian, I find myself less inclined these days to criticize her for failing to come to the proper conclusion, and more impressed at her apparent desire to find it in the first place.\n\nAs she narrates the tempest of emotions she felt the morning after her one night stand with a companion she met on the dating app Tinder, she vulnerably expresses her concerns over being perceived as a \"slut,\" \"morally deficient,\" or \"dirty.\" She acknowledges \"falling for\" her partner's flattering compliments. And Ulubay voices her persistent desire to \"have a man who wants me despite how fallible, loud or political I can be. Someone who, with a kiss, can snap me out of my self-pitying reverie.\"\n\nIt doesn't take a psychologist to realize that what Ulubay wants is love. She wants real intimacy. She wants the safety of what marriage was always intended to be. And like so many, she finds herself adrift in a culture of shallow romance coupled with sexual excess. A culture that clutches its chest and sighs longingly as it watches the third make-out session on that night's episode of The Bachelor, while simultaneously relegating abstinence, virtue, and Biblical sexual morality to a bygone era.\n\nI feel sympathy for Gabrielle Ulubay; not in a condescending way, and not because she asked for it. I feel it because I can't imagine trying to navigate the pressures of relational intimacy without a guidepost grounded in something more foundational than the wise counsel of my parents, without a compass calibrated by something more reliable than my fickle emotions. In short, I can't imagine attempting to find and express love without the living personification of love a permanent resident of my heart.\n\nYes, I'm talking about Jesus. And I know that's not fashionable, culturally relevant, or likely to land my opinions in the Times, but that doesn't really matter. If we're all doing the best we can, if we're all trying to piece this thing together as we go, if cultural wisdom says that no one's perspectives are any more legitimate or valid than another's, then what's the harm in expressing mine?\n\nAfter all, Gabrielle writes of soliciting the advice of her friends, whose counsel included a perplexing call to \"find it within yourself.\" Ulubay's exasperation at that recommendation is not unlike my own as she asks, \"How do I search within myself?\" That's just it. We're the confused ones in the first place \u2013 Gabrielle, me, you, all of us. If we're honest, that should be enough to tell us the answers don't lie within us, but without.\n\nThere's more to the Christian sexual ethic than a despotic list of don'ts. There's a holistic and healthy ideal that includes recognizing the person you are dating is someone's future spouse, and should be treated with the same dignity that we would want another treating our future spouse. There's an enduring commendation of the formation of lifelong, loving relationships built not upon tawdry lusts but self-sacrificial commitment; the recognition that love is not something we feel, but something we do.\n\nIt's God's way, and because no one knows better what will bring us lasting contentment than our own Creator, it's the better way. And I am willing to bet it's the very thing that a culture of Gabrielles are looking for.\n\nPeter Heck is a speaker, author and teacher.

They berated political right-wing activists who stand against abortion. They spoke hatefully about conservative Christians who assert that life begins in the womb. Together, they passionately agreed that every woman should have the right to choose what she does with her body and that abortion should be a legal option for every woman.\n\nThis godly man could remain quiet no longer. He turned to the ladies and kindly asked if he might have a word. They agreed, so the preacher offered them a biblical view regarding the pre-born child. He quoted Luke 2:5, where the Bible describes Mary as being \"great with child\" and explained that God sees the pre-born as children\u2014not as mere tissue.\n\nHe further challenged their misconceptions, explaining that many Christians give of their time and effort to help distressed women looking for answers: \"Ladies, Christians do not hate those who abort babies, but they do believe that abortion is against God's plan. Many organizations helping women who face unwanted pregnancy are established and supported by Christians who want to show God's love to those without hope.\"\n\nAs the preacher humbly concluded his thoughts, the ladies, captivated, grew quiet. Their political views had not necessarily changed, but because this man was not afraid to speak up, they had heard a Christian's beliefs poured out from a heart of compassion. As the conversation ended, the women evidenced respect for this preacher who had lovingly articulated the truth of God's Word.\n\nWould your opinion on abortion be similar to that of these ladies? Perhaps you feel uncertain about the issue. Take a few moments to consider when life actually begins.\n\nFrom eternity past, God had predetermined, according to His foreknowledge, that man would need a Savior to die for their sins (Acts 2:23). This Savior was Jesus\u2014God who took on flesh to come to us. Jesus' predetermined death began with a predetermined birth. \"And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favor with God. And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David\" (Luke 1:30\u201332).\n\nThe birth of Christ was no coincidence; it was planned and appointed by God. The Old Testament contains hundreds of prophecies concerning the birth of Christ. (Micah 5:2 prophesied where Christ's birth would take place, and Daniel 9:24\u201326 prophesied its timing.) The probability of all these prophecies taking place exactly as recorded is inconceivable, yet they did. Only God could have orchestrated such an event.\n\nEven before baby Jesus was born, He was living proof that God's design for life begins at conception. Scripture does not refer to the life growing inside Mary as a mere tissue. Notice how Luke 2:5 refers to Jesus when He was still in the womb of His mother: \"Mary...being great with child.\" Scripture does not use the words embryo or tissue; it refers to a child.\n\nGod does not make a distinction between the pre-born and the born; both are children whom He has created. To God, the pre-born child is alive and possesses the same distinctions inherent to all humanity.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court struggles with this concept. With regard to the Roe v. Wade decision, the court made a tremendous mistake\u2014ruling in favor of abortion\u2014that has been a blight on our nation ever since.\n\nThe court stated, \"We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary at this point in the development of man's knowledge is not in a position to speculate as to the answer.\" In other words, \"We are not equipped to answer the question concerning where life really begins. This is above our pay grade.\"\n\nThere is One, and only One, who is capable of answering that question\u2014the One who created life. Though our culture seems blind to the truths of the Bible, we must align our beliefs with God's principles and hold fast to His view of life\u2014the view revealed in His account of Christ's divinely appointed birth.\n\nWhile popular culture may consider abortion an option, it is not a biblical option. God's Word leaves no room for doubt concerning the inception of human life and the personhood of an unborn infant.\n\nThe miraculous conception of Jesus Himself is a reminder that the pre-born child is indeed a precious life given by God. Every child has been planned by God and created with a special purpose for his life. God uniquely prepares each child even while he is still in his mother's womb that he might fulfill this distinctive purpose.\n\nIn a day when the sanctity of human life is quickly eroding, Christians must lovingly and unashamedly stand for the truth. Proverbs 31:8\u20139 instructs us to be a voice for the oppressed who are unable to speak for themselves: \"Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction. Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.\"\n\nSurely unborn children need us to defend them and speak for them. They need us to recognize and respect the value of their life.\n\n(Dr. Paul Chappell is the pastor of Lancaster Baptist Church and the president of West Coast Baptist College in Southern California.

The following are doses of reality that bust these myths. Read more about five more myths below and catch up on the previous five myths in The Christian Post here.\n\nMyth #6: Health care sharing ministries are not regulated.\n\nReality: While it is true that health care sharing ministries are not subject to state health insurance laws (because they are not health insurance), that doesn't mean HCSMs aren't subject to any laws.\n\nHCSMs are regulated as charities in their home states under each state's charity laws and each state's attorney general, and as 501(c)3 charities by the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nBut the best regulators are HCSM members. First, for example, members of Samaritan Ministries International elect from within the membership the majority of the individuals serving on the Board that governs SMI. Also, Samaritan's Guidelines provide a complaint resolution process. Members dissatisfied with administrative decisions can appeal to a randomly chosen panel of 13 other members. That process has been invoked only four times in Samaritan's 23-year history.\n\nEvidence points to member satisfaction through file drawers full of letters from members who like Samaritan Ministries and thank God for having provided this ministry.\n\nMyth #7: Health insurance=health care.\n\nReality: While this might not necessarily be a myth about health care sharing ministries, it's closely related and a common misconception of those just learning about HCSMs.\n\nHealth insurance and health care are not synonymous. Health care is obtaining a service from a medical provider. Health insurance is contracting with a third party to pay for those services in exchange for premiums. Just because you don't have health insurance doesn't mean you don't have health care. Doctors are not required to see patients or accept their health insurance.\n\nBeing part of a health care sharing ministry allows members to bypass the third parties. They deal directly with a medical provider and directly with the HCSM. It's a bit more responsibility for members, but they are able to see the actual cost of care, thus helping them be better patients and stewards of God's provisions. One of the problems in health care today is that patients with health insurance are generally ignorant of the costs of medical care. Cash-pay patients, including those who are members of health care sharing ministries, can make better decisions about their health care because they become better informed about the process and costs.\n\nMyth #8: People won't send money to people they don't know.\n\nReality: Samaritan members have been sending money to people they don't know for more than 23 years\u2014about $25 million per month at this writing. It can be difficult for someone who doesn't believe in Christ and the Bible to understand why someone would want to send money to another person they don't know, let alone trust that a person they don't know will send money to them when they have a need. However, Christians who live according to the instructions of the Scriptures understand their responsibility to help those in need and trust that they will be treated the same in their time of need. Samaritan Ministries believes that, ultimately, God provides\u2014often through His children.\n\nMyth #9: Health care sharing ministries turn away people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nReality: Samaritan Ministries doesn't deny membership to anyone for health reasons.\n\nNeeds from pre-existing conditions aren't eligible for sharing as regular needs. However, needs related to conditions that existed before a person joined may eventually become able to be shared under certain conditions, such as an absence of symptoms for a certain number of years depending on the condition. In addition, needs related to pre-existing conditions may also be submitted as a \"Special Prayer Need.\" SPNs are needs that fall outside the Guidelines (expenses related to pre-existing conditions, extensive dental work, orthodontics, etc.) but that are causing a financial burden. If approved, they are included on a month's share slips for voluntary giving above and beyond one's monthly share. In some cases, Samaritan even shares SPNs related to expenses incurred before the person's membership started.\n\nMembers of Samaritan Ministries send their money directly to each other. The only money sent to the ministry's office is an enrollment fee, a new member's first two monthly shares, and an annual membership share. Shares are only sent to households that have sent itemized medical bills to Samaritan and whose bills have been determined to be within the ministry's Guidelines.\n\nHealth care sharing is not a \"Ponzi scheme\" because there is no promise of \"returns\" to \"investors.\" In fact, Samaritan goes to pains to make sure anyone interested in joining knows there's no guarantee of any kind of payment because health care sharing is not health insurance. Samaritan operates on faith, and has done so for 23 years. And the method is effective.\n\nNeither is health care sharing a \"pyramid scheme\" because, while members are encouraged to spread the word about Samaritan, there is no requirement for them to get new members to sign up in order to be able to remain members. There is the incentive of a $100 credit for those members who are listed as referrals by new members, but telling others about Samaritan is not required.\n\nThere is also no need to recruit new members so as to \"pay off\" a backlog of needs of the old members. When needs for a month exceed available shares, Samaritan pro rates needs. And when there are not enough needs to use all the available shares, everyone can sometimes actually receive a share reduction.\n\nBonus myth: Health care sharing is too expensive for the average family.\n\nReality: The facts reveal that it is health insurance that is too expensive for the average family. According to the 2017 Milliman Medical Index, the cost of health insurance for a family of four without employer contribution is $26,944.\n\n\"Of the $26,944 spent by the MMI's family of four, $11,685 is paid by the employee, through a combination of $7,151 in payroll deductions for premium, and $4,534 in out-of-pocket costs incurred at time of care,\" the report at milliman.com (May 16, 2017) said.\n\n\"Employer-sponsored\" insurance can also be deceiving. It sounds like a bonus, as it is a tax-free benefit that companies provide to their employees, but it's really a tax break for employers that also restricts patients' freedom of health care choices. If the company's share of health care costs were given to employees in cash, tax-free or not, employees could spend it as they see fit.\n\nBy contrast, a year's worth of Samaritan Classic monthly shares for a family of four is $5,940 ($495 per month), with one month of that a membership fee. The numbers would be even less for Samaritan Basic.\n\nThat, of course, includes a $250,000 per need cap. So factoring in the program for needs over $250,000, Save to Share ($399 set aside per year for family household and less for others), with no cap per incident, would add to that. It would still, however, be much less than the cost of health insurance, whether out-of-pocket or employer-provided.\n\nIn an ever-changing health care landscape, many are researching health care sharing ministries\u2014and for good reason. Myth often becomes a welcome reality.\n\nMichael Miller is a communications specialist at Samaritan Ministries International.

We live in a time of great corruption and uncertainty. We live in a time of great splendor, and beauty, and technological marvels and convenience. Yet suicide rates are on the rise according to the CDC suicide rates have doubled in the United States when comparing the early 2000s to the late 2000s up to 2014 (source). According to the World Happiness Report in 2007 the United States ranked 3rd in happiness in surveyed countries, and in 2016 we'd dropped to 19th (source).\n\nThere is a sense of growing corruption in our times, and of growing polarization in our culture. There are no longer shared beliefs of the past that unite all Americans in common heritage and worldview. There are now two chief warring worldviews in the United States, each of which are distinct and unique, with many varying viewpoints, but generally these two worldviews come down to the traditional vs. the progressive.\n\nThe traditional would affirm certain core philosophies held, some unknowingly, like the values leading back to ancient Greek and Roman thought, coming from people like Plato, Aristotle, and Socrates. Married with the ancient Greek philosophy of seeking unity in diversity is of course the religious heritage of Christianity in Protestant and Catholic forms, as well as various forms of Judaism. Prominent foundational thinkers of this worldview would include of course Jesus Christ, Moses, and the church fathers like Augustine, Origen, Justin Martyr, and others. Other foundational thinkers would include people like George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, John Locke (philosopher) and Martin Luther (the Reformation).\n\nCurrent leaders include Victor Davis Hanson (author and speaker), Ravi Zacharias (famed Christian apologist), Mike Lee (Senator), Ted Cruz (Senator), Mark Levin (talk show host), Franklin Graham (Christian leader), David Horowitz (political philosopher), Dennis Prager (orthodox Jew and talk show host), Ben Shapiro (orthodox Jew and political commentator) and Dinesh D'Souza (Catholic apologist and film maker). Baked into these various forms of traditionalism are ideas like objective truth, natural law (God given rights), the concept of absolute truth, individual liberty, religious freedom, free market economics, the right to life, natural marriage and the fallen nature of man.\n\nBaked into the worldview of progressivism are ideas like the basic goodness of humanity, equality, group rights, critical theory, deconstructionism, advocating for victim groups, social safety nets, welfare, socialism and democratic socialism, government redistribution of wealth, class structures, the evolutionary view of human origins, naturalism, post-modernism and viewing the course of history as a constant progression and of viewing humanity as always progressing toward the greater good.\n\nThis worldview tends to believe that a ruling elite of academics, scientists, rationalists, philosophers, political commentators and bureaucrats should rule over the society and guide the course of society, through direct democracy, and guided by the larger society's view of what progression toward utopia looks like. This worldview generally believes that very little can be learned from history, and the present must always be remade and reshaped, always evolving toward a better future.\n\nThe traditionalist view is quite different of course, believing instead that the present must be guided by the past, by history, and by learning throughout the ages. In general this worldview believes that Judaeo-Christian ethics, the ideas brought forth from the Torah and the Christian Bible form the best foundation for the ideals for a society to live by. Individual liberty is vital, religious liberty is vital, and economic liberty is very important as well. The society is considered a meritocracy where people rise and fall based on how hard they work and how well they put their ideas and values into practice.\n\nEquality is also valued, but not in the same way as in the progressive worldview. Equality is viewed as secondary to liberty in the traditional view, while in the progressive view equality tends to be prime, while liberty is secondary to the progressive worldview.\n\nProbably the deepest foundational difference between progressive and traditionalist is their views on the nature of man: The traditionalist recognizes man is basically sinful and fallen, with a capacity to become good if brought into religious faith and good moral practice while the progressive tends to believe that man is basically good and pure, with a capacity to do evil only on an institutional level, therefore existing institutions must be torn down and replaced with a truly equal society in which all are treated fairly.\n\nOf course the deepest foundation of this belief is regarding the nature of the universe itself, the progressive sees a random material evolving universe in which there is no truth or absolutes and values are fungible, while the traditionalist sees an ordered universe intelligently designed by a creator, with inherent values, absolutes and objective realities.\n\nSo those are the two worldviews battling in our society. There are varying forms of course on both sides, traditionalists might be more libertarian, or more deist, or more Christian, or even atheist or gay or transgender conservatives would fall under this umbrella, additionally some would identify as paleo-conservatives, Traditionalist (with a capital T) and neo-conservative. Many progressives would consider themselves more liberal, less liberal, social justice warriors, progressives, democratic socialists, communists, blue dogs, classical liberals, atheists, naturalists, deists, liberal Christian, progressive Christian, new left, black lives matter and so on and so forth.\n\nNow let me tell you, I understand the frustration with the polarization in our country, and in the western world overall. It's really annoying, frustrating, and mind-boggling. But I'm really sorry to tell you that's there no easy way to \"come together.\"\n\nSo many complain about the polarization of the country, but we've really been coming to this point for a long time. There is a very real difficulty, seemingly insurmountable difficulty, in reconciling the traditional worldview and the progressive worldview. They are fundamentally different worldviews, with fundamentally different presuppositions. And both views can produce decent evidence for their positions. So there isn't a simple way to come together.\n\nThough I suppose it could start with a willingness for both sides to stop with the inflated rhetoric, but I don't think we'll see that happen because it's so intense on both sides. Progressives come and out shout \"Thousands of people will die if Obamacare is repealed!\" And Conservatives are just as quick to point out \"that if the progressive agenda is allowed to continue it will mean the total collapse and destruction of western civilization itself!\" The rhetoric is wild on both sides. And the differences are not just policy-deep, they're systemic foundational beliefs.\n\nSo we see this struggle in our country between left and right. Some think both sides are pretty much the same, and there is a certain truth to that, in that there are \"establishment\" sides to both parties, that tend to be interior between the line, that are snuggled up close with special interest groups, lobbyists and the big money.\n\nThese are the sitting senators and congressmen who have been in their respective bodies for 20, 30 and even 40 years. It's a sad state of affairs, but let me assure you that returning to this supposed bi-partisan middle ground is not the answer either. It was this establishment middle ground that brought us to the point of 20+ trillion dollars in debt, hyper-inflation, career politicians, and Washington becoming a place that was seemingly cut off from the will of the people.\n\nPolitics is politics. I don't have a further comment on all this progressive vs. traditionalist struggle. Obviously I would fall more on the traditionalist side of the struggle. But my concern is the state of human souls. My concern is helping people to understand what the meaning of life is, and how to connect with what is beyond us. And I do believe there is a way forward.\n\nUltimately it will have to start with me. And with you. We look to solving the problems of the world by changing things around us, but what about us? It has to start with us, internally, and how we live externally.\n\nWe've often been a people of hedonism. We've been indulgent and lazy, staring at the television when we should've been pursuing holiness. We've prostituted ourselves to one night stands when we should've been mighty men and women of God, standing boldly, with great dignity and honor against the rising tide of darkness. We should've been building up the future generations, not destroying them, lying to them and educating them into imbecility. We've made many mistakes, and to better the world we must better ourselves.\n\nBut there is still hope. We can patch up these wounds, and cry out to God almighty for His help and deliverance, and come to a humility, and a patient knowledgeable about who we are and what we need. The truth is there is only one who can truly transform our souls into new people, it's God. But of course the question must come up and many would ask, \"Why do you believe in God?\"\n\nIt's a fair question and a good question. Most assume that Christians are backwards fundamentalists who have faith in things that are not true and are simply practicing a sort of cultural faith based on their heritage. If that were the sum of it, I would not be here now talking about it, because if that's all it is, then it's nothing, and it's less than nothing, it's just an empty pattern of nothingness.\n\nThankfully that's not what I believe. I believe in a reasonable, intelligent faith based on history, science, personal experience, textual criticism, and philosophy. And I believe facts in these disciplines indicate that God does exist. Christianity is unique as a world religion in that there is a great deal of historical and archaeological evidence for the facts depicted in the biblical documents.\n\nSo my response regarding the existence of God is this: I think it's very reasonable to believe in God. Let me tell you why:\n\n1. The universe exists and it must have a cause, everything that begins to exist has a cause. The universe began to exist. Evolution can't create, neither can science. The universe needs a first cause that is timeless, outside the system and infinitely powerful. God is the logical first cause (cosmological argument)\n\n2. The universe is finely tuned, there is order in the universe at work that allows for planets, stars and galaxies. There are laws in the universe, constants like gravity, relativity, and so on. It's reasonable that when we find mathematical laws and cosmological laws in the universe, that there is a powerful being that created those systems (argument from design)\n\n3. Within the human cell we find massive amounts of information. When we look at the human eye, we see a system so incredibly complicated that it could never come about by chance. When scientists look into the human body they see a complex yet harmonious system of machinery. We see cells and tissue, and DNA and systems that all function as one, and are irreducibly complex. (specified complexity, irreducibly complexity).\n\n4. The human mind intuitively knows that there is good and evil, right and wrong, good and bad. Objective moral laws exist, they are universal. If objective morals exist, then an objective moral law giver must exist, therefore God exists. (moral argument)\n\nThose are four key logical progressions that indicate it's reasonable to believe God is real. We can also talk about the historical authenticity of the biblical documents, how there are thousands of manuscripts that match each other highly accurately.\n\nAnd we can also talk about how Jesus Christ is mentioned in historical documents outside the Bible, such as in the histories of Tacitus and Josephus, indicating that Jesus Christ did really exist and his life was recorded. There is a great deal of evidence, and I think you'll see if you really research it, that Jesus is truly who He said He was and is, today alive and active in the world.\n\nSo we move beyond these key arguments for the existence of God. But for the believer reading these words, do memorize these facts and be prepared to provide an answer to those you may an encounter who don't know Jesus.\n\nWe should know the truth. And people in our world don't trust the word of God. We can show how science and history point to Christ. Many will not be interested in the truth anyway, just finding a way to avoid and reject the concept of a creator, but there are many out there who have genuine questions and are honestly searching for the truth. Give them answers.\n\nWe've often struggled as the church on Earth to contend with the forces of culture and change. Don't get me wrong, the church has done so much good in human history and does a great deal of good today. Please don't mistake me on that. But many of us have struggled to step out and take action, and meet people with the gospel.\n\nWe've sat idle in our citadels as the darkness closed in from every side. We've trembled and quaked at the thought that we might offend someone or we might get called judgmental. We've grown apathetic and exhausted self-pleasuring. Wve slept and stared at the television and the iphone while the moral structure of our society disintegrated.\n\nWe've been so afraid, so dossil, so set in our ways, so anachronistic that nothing seemed capable to move us, and our army disappeared around us, and all that was left was old women and young boys. We've left our responsibility to hold the line against the night, in line with the Spirit, and philosophical and moral chaos has resulted. We've allowed our religion to become a hellfire, a lie, and empty, and done little to remedy this.\n\nBut not all of us. Some of us continue to fight. Some of us like \"strider\" on the plains, remains as a sentinel, a sentry, lone patrol-men in the wilderness, without an army, but still jaunting through the night, fighting and ambushing enemy troops moving through our regions, sleeping on rocks and eating locusts and wild honey, dogged in our determination and unfailing in our hope. In the cold wind and moon-lit night we look up at the sky filled with stars and wonder if there is a future left. And when we sleep we dream of far away places, and see things yet to come, and something in those images heals us within. At one moment we fear and tremble, at the next we are filled with zeal and boldness, resolute to never give up the fight, to never stop trying, to stand for Christ to the very last battle. This is the struggle for the Christian soldier in the post-truth culture in which we live.\n\nWe stand, we fear, we fight, we struggle, we see the glory of God, yet we live in the angst of a fallen society. We're like Lot in the Sodom, sad in our hearts for the collapse. And we never give up. This is our lost cause. And more so, the cause of all mankind. In the world of darkness, a bright light has shined, and we now bear that sacred fire in our souls. We are the lightbringers, through Him who gives us strength. We are the keepers of the sacred fire, and the ones through whom Christ makes his appeal to the world.\n\nThis is my call to you Christians standing in these late hours: Stand firm, do not be moved. Don't give up, and don't lose heart. Don't lose heart in the face of sin, and darkness, and sin celebration, and even brokenness, abortion, broken families, child abuse, the mass marketing of lies, the corruption in the high places and all the rest. Do not lose heart. You must not.\n\nGuard your heart, and turn the eyes of your heart to Christ. As it says in Hebrews Chapter 12: \"Since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, 2 fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. 3 Consider him who endured such opposition from sinners, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.\"\n\nConsider what Jesus had to deal with. Are we so special in our time? Did modernism really herald a new age of goodness? Of course not. Very little has in fact changed. When Jesus spoke to the people, the crowds were divided, many believed him, many did not believe him and apposed him. That's how it always goes. Our time is no different. Though it is sad to see a nation that once honored God, began to mock, ignore, and reject the very concept of God. That tragedy should not be overlooked, and to mourn for a night is no sin.\n\nEverything is about Jesus, all of life is about Jesus, and the word itself is Jesus. That is the hardest thing. It's the almost impossible thing. It's the scariest thing because it's so unknown. It's so terrifying because it means giving up our own control. It's like a haunting specter, it's seems beyond us to do, not because we can't choose it, but because it's a new world that might leave us in last place.\n\nThat hardest thing is this: Really giving up our entire, whole life to Christ. And instead of us being in control of everything, we willingly yield our heart, life, plans, future, decisions, and even the things we love most dearly, to God almighty, and we admit, yes God is God, and I am not, and I give authority over to God. We yield our own authority to Him. Why? Because we can know, and know that the best life we can possibly live, not the easiest or the most pleasurable, but the most pure, right and best life course can only be found in Christ. We trust Christ for that. And we yield our destiny to Him.\n\nWe yield our future to him and our present day, yet we also yield our past to Him. We yield our past wrongs to him, we yield our sins to him, we yield every guilt to him, and we yield every painful memory, every anxiety, depression, youthful sorrow, lost love, broken childhood sorrows, all our brokenness, all our sins, all our wrongs, all our selfishness, all our self-seeking, all our evil desires, and our good desires, and every big thing and little thing, we yield to Him, and we are transformed fundamentally into a new person.\n\nNew life. We become a new person. I've experienced it myself. The new life is real. It's very, very real. As I see myself being changed internally, slowly but surely, I wonder at the possibilities, and I really wonder about the nature of reality itself.\n\nWe've been sold such a lie as young people in this day and age. We've been sold the lie that life has no meaning. Nothing could be further from the truth. It's a disgusting, ugly lie that entices us to live duplicitous, selfish lives of cynicism, indulgence and erotomania. It's sad, and pathetic, and it's left us chained to a hundred addictions, opening up desires in our hearts that nothing can ever fulfill. And we're exhausted by it all. We can't stand it and we found nothing in those bottles, pills, parties and sexual encounters except suicide and self-hatred.\n\nSo in the new life I wonder at my destiny: What is this future God has designed? What have I been chosen for? And I see in the future a perfect reality beyond the chaos and darkness of this world. I see a redeemed humanity living in a timeless state, on a perfected Earth, reset, redesigned and recrafted to a perfect city, a perfect nature, a perfect animal kingdom and a perfect humanity, perfected by Christ, and given great position and authority by Him who made the human soul. To know God is a lifelong process, this is not a once and done deal. To come to comprehend the glory of God is a lifelong process of seeking after God, and seeing God respond to your seeking. That is the truth of it.\n\nIf you've been hurt by religious people in the past, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, and I apologize on their behalf for what they did. We're suppose to represent Christ in this world as Christians and quite often we fail at that. I know I've personally failed at that time and again. But ultimately we can't look to Christ-followers for perfection, the whole point of Christianity is acknowledging our own sinfulness, our own shortcomings, selfishness, and turning to Christ for salvation and new life. We're between worlds right now, so Christians will always fail you. But Christ will never fail you, if you seek after Him.\n\nIf you don't know Him, then know Him. If you do know Him, then be a true Spirit filled born again follower of Jesus Christ. Be set on fire for Christ. Be excited for this mission. God has called you, in His will to a certain calling for your life. He will reveal it to you, and if He has, do walk in it, and do love it dearly. Love it with all your heart and do your very best at it. Be wise, and know His word clearly. Study it again and again. Be one of those rare Christians that truly brings the presence of God with you wherever you go. We see desperately need that sort of strong Spirit-filled Christianity today. There is so much compromise today, there is so much wishy-washyness in the church, and people are afraid to take a clear stance on difficult issues. Be bold, brave, and fearless. The people of this world desperately need you to be 100% all in for Jesus. Everything is at stake, everyday. Really live out the entailments of this Christian faith, recognize the ticking clock, the state of reality, and the future that is being offered to the human race. This is all real. That is the fundamental flaw of our modern Christianity, we've lived it out like it's a nice thing to talk about, when it's a true reality that should break through into every moment of our lives and completely transform how we see the world. And it will, if we'll just believe and realize how real and present it truly is.\n\nYes, life has meaning, yes, truth is knowable, yes, Christ is real, yes, the new world will come. It's all true. It's all real. And it was a shock to my entire world when I really realized that. I know it seems like there is little hope for our world. I know it seems like the darkness is too strong, and we are too weak. But those are just the sort of moments when God moves in and takes action to transform the world, when we know without a doubt that it must've been Him because we weren't strong enough to really make a difference. I don't really care about your politics, right, left, center, people can disagree and still love one another, what matters to me is your soul, and your eternal future. There is a God. He has designed the universe, this planet, the plants, animals, and the DNA strands in our body, and He will respond when you seek Him out. That is the craziest, most world shaking thing, when you seek out God and you realize for a moment as you sit alone in your room, that He's actually, really responding to your seeking. Now that will bring down the house of cards, let me tell you. It's true. Good luck, and God bless.\n\nEngaging views and analysis from outside contributors on the issues affecting society and faith today.\n\nCP VOICES do not necessarily reflect the views of The Christian Post.

But I have a challenge for all of you who still identify as Never Trumpers: Are you willing to be as honest about the accomplishments of President Trump as you are about his failings?\n\nFor many of you who could not vote for Trump, it was a matter of conscience. How could you be a \"values voter\" and yet vote for a man with such abysmal moral values, a thrice-married, playboy, billionaire?\n\nPut another way, your integrity compelled you to be a Never Trumper. But does your integrity now compel you to admit where he has done well? Where he has kept his promises? Where he has championed causes that really matter to \"value voters\"? Where he has stood strong for the some of the great moral issues of the day?\n\nLest you think I'm being one-sided in my challenge to Never Trumpers, in June I wrote an article titled, \"Don't Sell Your Soul Defending the Words of President Trump.\" And earlier this month I penned, \"As Evangelicals Our Ultimate Allegiance is to the Lord, Not the President,\" just to give two examples.\n\nIn short, I concur with prominent Never Trumper David French, who just last month counseled his colleagues to follow these guidelines: \"Praise him when he's right, critique him when he's wrong, apply the same standards to your own side that you apply to ideological opponents, and keep your eyes fixed on the larger, more important cultural trends.\"\n\nBut have Never Trumpers done this? On a regular basis, those of us who voted for Trump are called on to repudiate his latest ill-advised comment or tweet, or to condemn a past indiscretion. And with words similar to French's, I recently wrote, \"When the president does the right thing, we commend him and encourage him. When he does the wrong thing, with full respect for his office, we express our differences. Is this really so hard?\"\n\nBut I ask again, have you done this as Never Trumpers? Doesn't your integrity compel you to be even-handed, or, perhaps, to acknowledge where, at times, you may have been wrong?\n\nSince the media bombards us 24/7 with the latest failings or alleged failings of the President, there's no need for me to rehearse them here. Only the most extreme pro-Trumpers view him as a flawless saint.\n\nBut will you, my Never Trumper friends, be as truthful in your praise as you have been in your criticism?\n\nConsider the President's pro-life words and actions.\n\nHe appointed Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, along with a score of fine justices for other federal positions. This alone is highly significant.\n\nLast week, \"The Department of Justice (DOJ) filed an amicus (or 'friend-of-the-court') brief at the Supreme Court Wednesday, urging the justices to overturn a California law requiring pro-life crisis pregnancy centers to post information about state-funded abortions.\" Could anything be more anti-Obama than this?\n\nAlso last week, Trump made history as the first sitting president to address the March for Life in DC, which begs the question, Why didn't our previous, pro-life presidents do this? And in his speech, he criticized Roe v. Wade by name.\n\nIn terms of actions taken so far, was Vice President Pence exaggerating when he called Trump the \"most pro-life\" president in our history? Pence \"boasted of a litany of anti-abortion measures by the Trump administration over its first year: Banning federal funds for global health groups that promote abortion under the 'Mexico City policy,' defunding the United Nations Population Fund, and overturning an Obama administration rule that required states to provide funding for Planned Parenthood.\"\n\nHow about Trump's actions opposing LGBT activism and standing for religious freedoms?\n\nFor the first time in 8 years, last June was not gay pride month. In contrast, January 16 was just proclaimed \"Religious Freedom Day.\"\n\nEvaluating Trump's first year in office, a headline on The Hill announces, \"Trump administration amasses striking anti-LGBT record in first year.\" Similarly, a headline on The Conversation describes 2017 as \"the year of transgender moral panic.\"\n\nTo give one case in point, The Hill reported last October that, \"Attorney General Jeff Sessions is reversing course on the Justice Department's policy that a 1964 civil rights law protects transgender individuals from discrimination.\"\n\nAnd in stark contrast with the Obama administration's aggressive pushing of transgender activism in our children's schools, the DOJ under Trump has reversed course here as well. This too is quite major. (It does not bring me joy that transgenders and their allies feel threatened or insecure; it does bring me joy that sanity is prevailing in our schools.)\n\nTrump is also the first president to take a major step in repealing the onerous Johnson Amendment, although more still needs to be done to make this far-reaching and permanent.\n\nAnd what of Trump's decision to move our embassy to Jerusalem, along with his calling out of the Palestinian Authority's deception?\n\nFor many conservative voters, these are some of the most important issues: the sanctity of life and marriage; preserving religious freedoms; standing with Israel.\n\nAnd what of the strength of the economy? The decimation of ISIS?\n\nDo you have the integrity to commend the President for the good he has done?\n\nSteve Deace says it well: \"I was once NeverTrump. I have called our current president both a narcissist and a child. Compared him to both Peter Pan and former pro wrestling manager extraordinaire Bobby 'The Brain' Heenan.\n\n\"But...\n\n\"The news that the Trump administration is setting up a new division within the Department of Health and Human Services to protect the conscience rights of doctors, nurses, and other health-care providers is unambiguously good. It allows HHS to come to the defense of conscientious objectors working in the health-care field by defending the God-given rights of those who opt out of 'certain procedures' \u2014 like the killing field that is abortion or gender-bending sex-change operations.\"\n\nThis \"is an outcome that simply wouldn't and couldn't have happened if Hillary Clinton was president,\" nor Deace reasons, likely would have happened under an establishment candidate like Mitt Romney.\n\nSo, once more, my appeal to the Never Trumpers: Will you demonstrate your integrity by recognizing the good President Trump has done without overbalancing your statement with a litany of the negatives, at least just this one time? And might you even acknowledge that, in some important ways, he has done better than you expected?\n\nI look forward to hearing your responses.\n\nEngaging views and analysis from outside contributors on the issues affecting society and faith today.\n\nCP VOICES do not necessarily reflect the views of The Christian Post.

The blame game is fully in play. In very black and white terms, each political party is saying all the blame belongs on the other side. As in much of our current political discourse, presentation is made in an either/or, all/nothing sense. How should believers think about this situation? What would a third way say?\n\nUsually in a dysfunctional relationship, and our government is dysfunctional these days, it takes two to make the dysfunction. Now what we run to next, even when we acknowledge this, is to ask who bears the brunt of the blame. But does that really help us get out of the dysfunction? When do we take the view that we are called to own our own junk? Whatever the other has done wrong, what I can control is what I may be doing wrong that is contributing to the breakdown. Maybe what is wrong here is that each side is focused only on what it wants. So why not wrestle with an alternative way to address our current situation, a third way?\n\nSo where are we? One side is saying we need to fund the government. True enough. The other side is saying but funding the government one month at a time with piecemeal proposals, which we have been doing now for months, is no way to budget a great nation. What is wrong about that? Where is the black and white in that discussion? Who has it most right or wrong? Does that really help us? A solution is to get out of our black and white approach to issues to see the spectrum and discuss the relationship between the parts.\n\nThe sticking point in the current stalemate is the debate over DACA, the dreamers. Once again there is a black and white conflict as we discuss it: illegal immigration versus a sense of justice about children who have grown up here whose illegal presence was through no fault of their own but that of their parents, something our previous protection of them recognized. Even more amazing is that each side says DACA should be fixed and protections should be provided. As the old Nike ad says, then why not just do it?\n\nWhat is in the way are different, one dimensional answers for how we should approach the solution to that particular problem that has depth and is not one dimensional. Again we have a black and white discussion: the law needs to be followed with crucial concerns about security versus should we honor our sense of justice about these children who have been here much of their lives? Who wants to make that choice as an either/or? Both are worthy considerations.\n\nPerhaps we should ask, what should be the relationship between these two worthy goals. Maybe we should ask what the spectrum of options might be for trying to be sensitive to both concerns. Maybe we should wrestle with how to craft laws that seek to balance two sets of legitimate concerns. Maybe we should \"come let us reason together\". The third way of the church would be concerned with the human dimensions on all sides of this question. It would recognize a spectrum and ask how to balance two sets of legitimate concerns. We have the right to change how our laws work and craft better ones that work. It would ask how we can craft something that balances these concerns.\n\nAs concerned citizens, rather than allowing each party to grab one concern and pit it against the other, we should insist and look for people to govern who get this alternative way of doing legislation. We should look for people who see the spectrum and ask about how competing themes relate to each other. There will still be differences and debates for sure, but there also will be more options to consider than the ones that lead us into a government shutdown. Maybe the third way asks us to more interested in how we can live better together than who is most to blame.\n\nDr. Darrell L.

Part 1 of 7.\n\nHeadline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!\n\nVaccine Safety Assessments & Vaccine Science Falsified to Support Vaccination Policy\n\nby Vera Sharav\n\nVaccine Safety Assessments & Vaccine Science Falsified to Support Vaccination Policy\n\nby Vera Sharav\n\nNote from the WMP Team: Following is Part One in a seven-part series of Vera Sharav\u2019s in-depth expos\u00e9 of the complex and widespread corruption that exists in the vaccination program. Her investigation has uncovered decades-long fraudulent activity that has permeated the vaccine industry. Sharav\u2019s research is a must-read by those in our community because it explains the intricate groundwork that has led us to the debacle we are now living with \u2014 an epidemic of sick children.\n\nThe exponential increase in the autism / autism spectrum prevalence rate since 1985 (1 in 2,500) to 2016 (1 in 45) is evidence of an epidemic, not, as the deniers will have it, \u201can optical illusion\u201d or \u201ca statistical mirage.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026today a million and more Americans, almost all under thirty, have been formally diagnosed with autism\u2026Most with an autism diagnosis will never [lead normal lives] or be responsible for their health and welfare. Both the increase and the burden it imposes are widely recognized by thousands of parents and frontline professionals such as nurses and teachers. Yet some of the most prominent and powerful people in medicine, the media, and government deny it.\u201d [DENIAL: How Refusing to Face the Facts about Our Autism Epidemic Hurts Children, Families, and Our Future, Mark Blaxil and Dan Olmsted (2017)]\n\nAre children\u2019s rights to a normal life being sacrificed as collateral damage to protect high utilization of vaccines?\n\nThe focus of this appendix is how the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the vaccine industry control vaccine safety assessments, control the science of vaccines and control the scientific and mass channels of information about vaccines. These primary stakeholders gained control by establishing an elaborate web of collaborating institutional partnerships which they fund. The collaborating institutional stakeholders include:\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics,\n\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization (JCVI, UK),\n\nThe World Health Organization,\n\nWHO-Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety ( GACVS ),\n\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA),\n\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention & Control (ECDPC),\n\nThe Brighton Collaboration and the Brighton Collaboration Foundation,\n\nThe Cochrane Collaboration,\n\nThe Institute of Medicine,\n\nThe Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS),\n\nThe Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization ( GAVI ) which is bankrolled by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,\n\nWorld Bank and others.\n\nNumerous additional industry front groups are popping up on social media to spread vaccine propaganda, such as the European Health Parliament (EHP, situated in Brussels, created in 2017). EHP is bankrolled by Johnson and Johnson and is affiliated with Google, Politico and others. [Appendix 10 is being updated. It will publish shortly.]\n\nAll of these institutions became de facto stakeholders in promoting vaccination policies while presenting themselves as independent authoritative sources of information about vaccine safety.\n\nThrough this elaborate network of collaborative partnerships, industry gained global control of vaccine safety assessments \u2014 which are applied as the single standard, used mostly to rule out a causal relationshipbetween vaccination and serious adverse events following vaccination. These centrally controlled assessments are applied indiscriminately in all cases, disregarding individual human susceptibility factors.\n\nOne of the intended features of these collaborating partnerships is to camouflage the identity of the funding source for vaccine research and professed independent reviews of vaccine research. Medical journals, as the editor-in-chief of The Lancet, Dr. Richard Horton acknowledged, \u201cdevolved into information laundering operations for the pharmaceutical industry.\u201d Indeed, the BMJ (British Medical Journal) entered into undisclosed partnership agreements with both major vaccine manufacturers. In 2008, BMJ and Merck entered into partnership and in 2016, BMJ and GlaxoSmithKline formed a partnership as well. Additionally, vaccine stakeholders control the vast channels of propaganda \u2014 including Google, which has formed a partnership with GlaxoSmithKline.\n\nThe financial interest of these collaborating partnerships conflicts with the tenets of medical ethics and scientific integrity \u2014 such as transparency and independent assessment of the data. The consequences of these ill-suited partnerships are demonstrated by evidence of corrupt vaccine safety assessments; evidence of harm following vaccination is either concealed or defined as non-related; journal publications are corrupted by fraudulent reports, and honest scientific findings are suppressed. The entire web of vaccine stakeholder- collaborations is geared toward issuing uniform vaccine safety pronouncements that promote vaccination policies crafted to ensure high vaccination rates, translating to ever higher profit margins.\n\nMuch of the evidence is documented in thousands of internal CDC documents (some were obtained in 2011);[1] additional CDC internal documents were obtained in July 2017.[2] The evidence is also documented in transcripts of closed-door meetings, such as the Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) at Simpsonwood (2000); the Institute of Medicine Committee on Immunization Safety Review (2001); and the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI, 1990). These documents were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Evidence was also gathered in the course of a criminal investigation of Dr. Poul Thorsen by the U.S. Inspector General, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n\nBackground:\n\nWhat Did CDC Officials Know About Thimerosal; When Did They Know It, & What Did They Do About It?\n\nIn 1974, the FDA convened a panel of experts to conduct a comprehensive review of the safety and effectiveness of over-the-counter medicines. One facet of the review was OTC drugs that contained mercury whose function was to kill bacteria to prevent infection. In 1980, the Advisory Review Panel submitted its report to the FDA, having reviewed 18 products containing mercury. It found the products either unsafe or ineffective. The report cited several studies demonstrating human hypersensitivity to thimerosal:\n\n\u201cmercury compounds as a class are of dubious value for anti-microbial use. Mercury inhibits the growth of bacteria, but does not act swiftly to kill them.\u201d\u201cThe Panel concludes that thimerosal is not safe for OTC topical use because of its potential for cell damage if applied to broken skin, and its allergy potential. It is not effective as a topical antimicrobial because its bacteriostatic action can be reversed.\u201d[4]\n\nAfter the determination by the FDA advisory committee, Eli Lilly chose to cease production of Thimerosal-containing products. Despite the evidence, Thimerosal continued to be added to vaccines. In 1990, Professor Hans Wigzell, Rector of the Karolinska Institute, Sweden, and member Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine, wrote \u201cDifficult to Substitute Mercury as a Preservative in Bacterial Vaccines\u201d, in which he recommended that:\n\n\u201ca study [be conducted] to show if there is a difference in general toxicity when uptake of mercury is from the stomach-intestines or after injections\u2026This should be studied in relation to the tremendous large number of subjects vaccinated with preparations containing thimerosal sodium; Our goal is to develop, as soon as possible, vaccines completely free of mercury.\u201d[5]\n\nIn 1991, Dr. Maurice Hilleman, an internationally renowned Merck vaccinologist, wrote a memo to the president of Merck\u2019s vaccine division stating:\n\n\u201c6-month-old children who received their shots on schedule would get a mercury dose up to 87 times higher than guidelines for the maximum daily consumption of mercury from fish. When viewed in this way, the mercury load appears rather large. The key issue is whether thimerosal, in the amount given with the vaccine, does or does not constitute a safety hazard. However, perception of hazard may be equally important.\u201d [6]\n\nThe FDA delayed issuing its final rule on thimerosal until 1998, stating: \u201csafety and effectiveness have not been established for the ingredients (mercury based preservatives)\u2026 manufacturers have not submitted the necessary data in response to earlier opportunities.\u201d[7]The rule, however, applied only to OTC products.\n\nIn 1991, Dr. Peter Aaby, Director of the Bandim Health Project, a demographic surveillance system (in Guinea-Bissau, West Africa), which is affiliated with the Statens Serum Institute, identified non-specific adverse vaccine effects which go beyond the specific protective effects of the targeted disease. He noted that these non-specific effects can be beneficial or harmful. Dr. Aaby has conducted a series of comparative \u201cnatural studies\u201d of vaccinated and unvaccinated children in high-mortality regions in rural Africa, that consistently confirmed that:\n\n\u201cThough a vaccine protects children against the target disease it may simultaneously increase susceptibility to unrelated infections.\u201d[8]\n\nThe First Large-Scale Scientifically Sound CDC Epidemiological Study\n\nThe 1999 CDC study sought to determine the relative risk for infants following exposure to thimerosal-containing childhood vaccines was conducted by Dr. Thomas Verstraeten and three CDC colleagues who examined the evidence documented in CDC\u2019s Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD). They analyzed the medical records of 400,000 infants born between 1991 and 1997 that were maintained by four HMOs and assessed the risk of autism for the children at different ages.\n\nThis was a scientifically solid study; it provided scientific documentation that: exposure to thimerosal during the first month of life increased the relative risk of autism by 7.6 i.e., 760%.\n\nThe VSD data revealed additional risks as well: 1.8 increased relative risk for a neurodevelopmental disorder; 2.1 relative risk for speech disorder; and 5-fold increased relative risk for a nonorganic sleep disorder. The evidence documents that infants exposed to vaccines laced with thimerosal during the first month of life are at an alarmingly high increased risk of serious harm.\n\nIn December 1999, Dr. Verstraeten sent an email to his co-authors and CDC colleagues, Dr. Robert Davis and Dr. Frank DeStefano; the subject line was \u201cit just won\u2019t go away\u201d. The email attachments included four tables with relative risk data and the Abstract of their study findings, that he was submitting for a presentation, at the high level (by invitation only) meeting, convened by CDC\u2019s Epidemic Intelligence Service, at Simpsonwood Retreat Center in Georgia (2000).[9]\n\nThe title of their study: \u201cIncreased Risk Of Developmental Neurologic Impairment After High Exposure To Thimerosal-Containing Vaccine In First Month Of Life.\u201d\n\nThe meeting was chaired by Richard Johnston, M.D., an immunologist and pediatrician (University of Colorado) who stated:\n\n\u201cThe data on its toxicity (shows) it can cause neurologic and renal toxicity, including death. We learned [sic] a number of important things about aluminum, and I think they also are important in our considerations today.\u201d\n\n\u201cAluminum salts are important in the formulating process of vaccines, both in antigen stabilization and absorption of endotoxin. Aluminum and mercury are often simultaneously administered to infants, both at the same site and at different sites.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever [sic] there is absolutely no data, including animal data, about the potential for synergy, additively or antagonism, all of which can occur in binary metal mixtures that relate and allow us to draw any conclusions from the simultaneous exposure to these two salts in vaccines\u2026\u201d [p. 19\u201320]\n\nDr. Verstraeten began his presentation by stating: \u201cwhat I will present to you is the study that nobody thought we should do.\u201d The study categorized the cumulative effect of thimerosal-containing vaccines administered to infants after one month of life and assessed the subsequent risk of degenerative and developmental neurologic disorders, and renal disorders before the age of six. Dr. Verstraeten stated that ALL of these relative risks were statistically significant.\n\nAnd he noted that: \u201cmercury at one month of age is not the same as mercury at three months, at 12 months, prenatal mercury, later mercury. There is a whole range of plausible outcomes from mercury.\u201d When asked about the risk of aluminum, he stated: \u201cthe results were almost identical to ethylmercury because the amount of aluminum goes along almost exactly with the mercury one.\u201d\n\nFollowing the presentation, Dr. Roger Bernier (Associate Director for Science NIP) stated: \u201cWe have asked you to keep this information confidential\u2026.Consider this embargoed information.\u201d [p. 113]\n\nIt is clear from the EIS transcript that the response to Dr. Verstraeten\u2019s research findings differed between pediatricians, who were genuinely concerned about the hazards of both Thimerosal and aluminum, whereas officials of government and non-government organizations (NGOs, that are dependent on government and industry support, such as the World Health Organization), focused on the threat to vaccination policy and the risk of litigation were intent on burying the data and maintaining secrecy about the findings.\n\nPediatricians focused on the risks, public health: Dr. William Weil, represented the American Academy of Pediatricians (AAP) stated:\n\n\u201c\u2026moving from one month or one day of birth to six months of birth changes enormously the potential for toxicity. There are just a host of neurodevelopmental data that would suggest that we\u2019ve got a serious problem. the potential for aluminum and central nervous system toxicity was established by dialysis data. To think there isn\u2019t some possible problem here is unreal.\u201d[p.24]\n\n\u201cAlthough the data presents a number of uncertainties, there is adequate consistency, biological plausibility, a lack of relationship with phenomenon not expected to be related, and a potential causal role that is as good as any other hypothesized etiology of explanation of the noted associations.\n\nIn addition, the possibility that the associations could be causal has major significance for public and professional acceptance of Thimerosal containing vaccines. I think that is a critical issue. Finally, lack of further study would be horrendous grist for the anti-vaccination bill. That\u2019s why we need to go on, and urgently I would add.\u201d [pg. 187 & 188]\n\n\u201cThe number of dose related relationships are linear and statistically significant. You can play with this all you want. They are linear. They are statistically significant.\u201d [p.207]\n\n[Dr. Weil may well have been informed by the following research report: Aluminum Neurotoxicity in Preterm Infants Receiving Intravenous-Feeding Solutions in the NEJM(1997) whose authors concluded: \u201cIn preterm infants, prolonged intravenous feeding with solutions containing aluminum is associated with impaired neurologic development.\u201d More on aluminum vaccine adjuvants below.]\n\nDr. Johnson: \u201cThis association leads me to favor a recommendation that infants up to two years old not be immunized with Thimerosal-containing vaccines if suitable alternative preparations are available\u2026 I do not want [my] grandson to get a Thimerosal containing vaccine until we know better what is going on.\u201d [p. 198]\n\nDr. Robert Brent [a Scientific Adviser to an industry front-group] focused entirely on protecting corporations from lawsuits:\n\n\u201cThe medical/legal findings in this study, causal or not, are horrendous and therefore, it is important that the suggested epidemiological, pharmacokinetic, and animal studies be performed. If an allegation was made that a child\u2019s neurobehavioral findings were caused by Thimerosal containing vaccines, you could readily find junk scientist who would support the claim with \u201ca reasonable degree of certainty\u201d.\n\nBut you will not find a scientist with any integrity who would say the reverse with the data that is available. And that is true. So we are in a bad position from the standpoint of defending any lawsuits if they were initiated and I am concerned.\u201d [pg. 229, emphasis added]\n\n*[Dr. Brent was a member of the Board of Trustees of the American Council on Science and Health (ACSH) a food and chemical industry front group which the Center for Science in the Public Interest described as, \u201cVoodoo Science, Twisted Consumerism\u201d[10]]\n\nDr. John Clements, who represented the WHO at the EIS conference, expressed alarm about the direction of the research, which he viewed as posing a threat to vaccination uptake if the information reaches the public:\n\n\u201cI am really concerned that we have taken off like a boat going down one arm of the mangrove swamp at high speed, when in fact there was not enough discussion really early on about which way the boat should go at all. And I really [don\u2019t] want to risk offending everyone in the room by saying that perhaps this study should not have been done at all, because the outcome of it could have, to some extent, been predicted\u2026 and we have all reached this point now where we are left hanging, even though I hear the majority of consultants say to the Board that they are not convinced there is a causality direct link between thimerosal and various neurological outcomes. I know how we handle it from here is extremely problematic.\u201d [Emphasis added]\n\n\u201c\u2026even if this committee decides that there is no association and that information gets out, the work that has been done and through the freedom of information that will be taken by others and will be used in ways beyond the control of this group. And I am very concerned about that as I suspect it already too late to do anything regardless of any professional body and what they say.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy mandate as I sit here in this group is to make sure at the end of the day that 100,000,000 are immunized with DTP, Hepatitis B and if possible Hib, this year, next year and for many years to come, and that will have to be with Thimerosal containing vaccines unless a miracle occurs and an alternative is found quickly and is tried and found to be safe. \u201c [emphasis added]\n\n\u201cI am very concerned that this has gotten this far, and that having got this far, how you present in a concerted voice the information to the ACIP [Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices] in a way they will be able to handle it and not get exposed to the traps which are out there in public relations.\n\nMy message would be that any other study, and I like the study that has just been described here very much. I think it makes a lot of sense, but it has to be thought through. What are the potential outcomes and how will you handle it? How will it be presented to a public and a media\u2026I wonder how on earth you are going to handle it from here.\u201c [p. 247\u2013249]\n\nOther comments from those present include:\n\n\u201cWe could exclude the lowest exposure children from the database\u201d; \u201cWe could remove children that got the highest exposure levels since they represented an unusually high percentage of the [adverse] outcomes\u201d; \u201cWe can push and pull this data any way we want to get the results we want;\u201d \u201cWe could have predicted the outcomes.\u201d\n\nCDC\u2019s Dr. Bernier reminded everyone: \u201cconsider this embargoed information\u2026and very highly protected information.\u201d\n\nThe concerns expressed at this Epidemic Intelligence Service meeting, by Dr. Clements and other public officials and industry representatives who asserted their determination to conceal the thimerosal evidence from the public, has been the policy of CDC and an international network. However, concealing the evidence does not eradicate the evidence. A compendium of 80 peer-reviewed, published studies found evidence of a link between thimerosal and neurological disorders, including autism. A recent Review paper (April 2017) documents that the continued use of thimerosal in underdeveloped countries provides evidence of its harmful impact.[11]\n\nWMP NOTE: This concludes Part One.

Add your two cents.\n\nHeadline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!\n\nBy Tina Lockhart\n\nDoes turmeric lower blood pressure? This question has been the focus of many research studies, as turmeric contains the antioxidant agent known as curcumin. Found in the roots of the turmeric plant, curcumin is a chemical compound and herbal remedy that has been used for centuries in Asian cultures. The healing effect of turmeric and curcumin on high blood pressure, or hypertension, has been documented, although researchers have not yet found a direct link to lowering blood pressure.\n\nNot to be confused with the Javanese turmeric root (Curcuma xanthorrhiza), which also comes from the ginger family, the turmeric plant (Curcuma longa) offers a pungent, bitter taste that is commonly used as a spice to flavor Chinese and Indian dishes, as well as to treat infections, wounds, colds, and indigestion. A popular way to use the plant is to place its powdered roots in boiling water for turmeric tea benefits.\n\nDisclaimer: Results are not guaranteed*** and may vary from person to person***.\n\nIn terms of blood pressure, turmeric has been shown to indirectly reduce inflammation of blood vessels, hinder clotting of the blood, and lower cholesterol levels.\n\nIn This Article:\n\nHow Turmeric Could Potentially Manage Blood Pressure1. Relaxes Blood Vessels\n\nThe curcumin in turmeric has been shown in clinical trials to help prevent the narrowing of blood vessels, which can increase blood pressure. This effect is seen with the use of isolated turmerone as well as turmeric oil fraction.\n\nStudies show that curcumin may actually cause vasorelaxation, during which the tension within the blood vessel walls is released. This action allows for smoother circulation flow, reducing blood pressure.\n\n2. Blood-Thinning Properties\n\nConsidered a potential natural blood thinner, turmeric is thought to work to prevent blood clotting as needed. The active properties of curcumin include anti-platelet activity.\n\nIt should be noted that, while studies suggest curcumin acts as a blood thinner, there have been no human trials involving patients receiving anti-coagulant medication. This includes those with a bleeding disorder.\n\nThe anti-coagulant properties of curcumin make it a dangerous choice for patients taking warfarin, or coumadin, as it may offer an increased risk of severe bleeding.\n\n3. Regulates Renin-Angiotensin System\n\nOne of the reported benefits of turmeric includes regulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which controls the blood pressure and fluid levels. As blood pressure rises, the renin-angiotensin system works to balance fluid levels in the body.\n\nRenin is an enzyme released by the kidneys that causes the blood pressure to rise as its levels increase. The blood flow to the kidneys is reduced by the constriction of the blood vessels.\n\nA study published in the Scientific Reports journal found that curcumin lowered the blood pressure of mice with angiotensin-II-induced hypertension.\n\n4. Replenishes Glutathione Antioxidant\n\nGlutathione is referred to as the \u201cmother of antioxidants,\u201d as it is a naturally produced immune booster and detoxifier in the body.\n\nA combination of the amino acids cysteine, glutamine, and glycine, this antioxidant can be depleted by certain medications, toxins, extreme stress, and poor eating habits.\n\nTurmeric helps restore glutathione levels, which could in turn control blood pressure, as well as prevent cell damage and other essential functions.\n\n5. Reduces Hypertension-Induced Oxidative Stress\n\nIt\u2019s been suggested that high blood pressure is caused by oxidative stress, which can lead to issues with the structure of the blood vessels.\n\nThe curcumin in turmeric may help lessen any inflammation and prevent the blood vessels from narrowing.\n\nOxidative stress occurs when the amount of harmful free radicals circulating the body is higher than the level of antioxidants needed to neutralize these negative agents.\n\nHypertension-induced oxidative stress can cause narrowing and thickening of the blood vessel walls and cells. The decrease in the vascular channels may lead to a rise in blood pressure.\n\n6. Improves Age-Related Arterial Dysfunction\n\nThe curcumin in turmeric has been proven in clinical studies to treat high blood pressure caused by age-related arterial dysfunction. The hardening of the arteries and low oxygen levels may lead to cardiovascular disease over time.\n\nThe antioxidants found in turmeric may stabilize the oxidative stress and help with arterial dysfunction.\n\n7. Boosts Nitric Oxide Levels\n\nTurmeric is thought to help boost nitric oxide levels. This molecule is essential to blood circulation, as it prompts the walls of the blood vessels to expand. This allows an increase in blood flow, which in turn lowers high blood pressure.\n\nNitric oxide may also help prevent the oxidative stress and inflammation that causes blood pressure to rise by controlling the inner lining of the blood vessels, known as the endothelium.\n\n8. Reduces Blood Cholesterol\n\nOf the few research studies on human patients that focus on the use of turmeric to lower cholesterol levels, the majority have reported a decrease in higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or bad cholesterol. High levels of LDL can block and damage the arteries.\n\nThe curcumin in turmeric has been shown to suppress genes that support LDL, and prevent oxidization of LDL. This cholesterol type leads to atherosclerosis, which is the hardening of the arteries.\n\n9. Keeps the Body Warm\n\nTurmeric is known as an active warming spice that increases the core body temperature by producing a drying effect. This occurs as the astringent tannins in turmeric squeeze the tissues, absorbing all excess water.\n\nAs the internal temperature rises, blood circulation flows smoothly, lowering the pressure of the blood against the arteries. High blood pressure is often seen when both internal and external temperatures are very low.\n\n10. Salt Replacement\n\nWith curcumin showing promise as an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiviral agent, it may be a better choice than salt for spicing meals.\n\nHigh blood pressure patients are advised to curb their salt use, as excess sodium in the bloodstream causes damage to the blood vessels due to the presence of excess fluid that cannot be removed by the kidneys.\n\nThe use of powdered turmeric for blood pressure lowering is recommended when replacing salt.\n\n11. Alleviates High Blood Pressure Risk Factors\n\nThe curcumin in turmeric acts as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. While high blood pressure has no one direct cause, there are risk factors that can lead to this state. A form of high blood pressure that is brought on by an existing health condition is known as secondary hypertension.\n\nRisk factors that may relate to high blood pressure include age, genetics, race, obesity, smoking, alcohol abuse, poor diet, inactivity, and stress, as well as underlying conditions like diabetes, sleep apnea, kidney disease, or even pregnancy.\n\nUsing turmeric may help with a few of these risk factors.\n\nThe Correct Dosage of Turmeric to Lower Blood Pressure\n\nHow much turmeric should you take for its blood pressure-lowering effects? It is important to understand that the curcumin content in turmeric has a high absorption rate, and the digestive system may not be able to easily break down the substance.\n\nTo help combat the curcumin dosage effects, combine the herb with extra virgin olive oil, coconut oil, or fish oil. There are also curcumin phytosome complex supplements that are designed to easily break down in the body.\n\nAs the degree of high blood pressure can vary for each individual, there is no universal dosage of turmeric.\n\nFor natural turmeric remedies, use the following guide. A word of caution: Turmeric should only be taken with or after meals.\n\nFresh turmeric roots: Use one to three grams, or one half-inch piece, chopped or finely sliced. A fresh turmeric root can also be used in a juicer with a pinch of black pepper.\n\nUse one to three grams, or one half-inch piece, chopped or finely sliced. A fresh turmeric root can also be used in a juicer with a pinch of black pepper.\n\nTurmeric powder: Add one teaspoon of turmeric powder to one meal daily. Combining one to two grams of turmeric powder and a quarter-teaspoon of black pepper twice daily is another option for direct consumption.\n\nAdd one teaspoon of turmeric powder to one meal daily. Combining one to two grams of turmeric powder and a quarter-teaspoon of black pepper twice daily is another option for direct consumption.\n\nGolden paste: Create a paste to increase the rate of absorption of the curcumin with the use of heat. Add a half cup of turmeric powder to one cup of water in a pot. Heat the mixture until a thick paste forms. Add one-and-a-half teaspoons of ground black pepper and 70 milliliters of coconut oil or cold-pressed olive oil. Cool and use a quarter to a half teaspoon for the first dosage. Then, increase the dosage by a quarter-teaspoon each week until one to two teaspoons can be tolerated two to three times daily.\n\nCreate a paste to increase the rate of absorption of the curcumin with the use of heat.

Then, increase the dosage by a quarter-teaspoon each week until one to two teaspoons can be tolerated two to three times daily.\n\nTurmeric tincture: Use 10 to 30 drops of turmeric tincture two to three times each day. Add the tincture to juice, smoothies, and teas.\n\nUse 10 to 30 drops of turmeric tincture two to three times each day. Add the tincture to juice, smoothies, and teas.\n\nTurmeric tea: The reported benefits of turmeric tea include the improvement of arthritis symptoms, cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s disease prevention, lower cholesterol, and a boosted immune system. Add one teaspoon of turmeric to four cups of boiling water. Simmer for 10 minutes and strain before drinking. Consume one to two cups daily.\n\nThe reported benefits of turmeric tea include the improvement of arthritis symptoms, cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s disease prevention, lower cholesterol, and a boosted immune system. Add one teaspoon of turmeric to four cups of boiling water. Simmer for 10 minutes and strain before drinking. Consume one to two cups daily.\n\nTurmeric milk: Heat a piece of turmeric measuring a half or one inch for 15 minutes with eight ounces of milk. Remove from heat once the milk begins to boil and strain to remove turmeric. Cool and consume one to two cups daily.\n\nHeat a piece of turmeric measuring a half or one inch for 15 minutes with eight ounces of milk. Remove from heat once the milk begins to boil and strain to remove turmeric. Cool and consume one to two cups daily.\n\nTurmeric supplements: Take two to three doses of 300 to 400 milligrams daily.\n\nPrecautions to Consider When Using Turmeric to Lower Blood Pressure\n\nNaturally, there are concerns over the effects of any blood pressure treatment. So, is turmeric safe?\n\nIt is in low doses. Turmeric ingested from food sources is considered to be within a safe range of consumption.\n\nThe precautions to take with turmeric come into play with supplements, or when large doses are consumed. Supplement labels may suggest up to four daily dosages of 500 milligram each.\n\nTurmeric may be dangerous in large doses because it is intended to lower blood pressure. If the pressure levels fall too low or too quickly, serious complications can arise. These can include a rapid heartbeat; high fever; hallucinations; and stomach, gallbladder, and kidney problems.\n\nThose with existing health conditions like diabetes and liver disease also need to take precautions when using turmeric. The properties of the spice may counteract certain prescription medications.\n\nPrescription, over-the-counter, and herbal painkillers and blood thinners may hinder essential blood clotting when used with large quantities of turmeric. Caution is also necessary when taking medications for stomach acid reduction.\n\nSurgical patients have an increased risk of bleeding if turmeric is used in the weeks leading up to surgery.\n\nIn addition to those with a pre-existing medical condition, pregnant women are also advised not to use turmeric in large doses, especially with supplements, as it may carry a high risk of miscarriage.\n\nDoes Turmeric Lower Blood Pressure?\n\nBased on results in traditional Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine and scientific trials, turmeric has the potential to lower high blood pressure in some cases.\n\nAs with any treatment, the effects of turmeric on high blood pressure will vary from individual to individual, and depend on the presence of an existing medical condition.\n\nA stable blood pressure relies on the proper function of the blood vessels and the circulatory system, both of which can be hindered by cardiovascular risk factors. Curcumin, the active compound in turmeric, appears to have multiple cardio-protective benefits.\n\nTurmeric in pure form or combined with other healthy herbs may be one of the most natural treatments, and possible prevention tools, in the battle against high blood pressure.\n\nHowever, any turmeric use should be discussed with your physician to prevent any potential allergic reactions or medication counteractions.\n\nLet\u2019s block ads!

Wade was decided, nearly 60 million abortions were performed in the U.S. That's more than all abortions in the previous two centuries combined. Dr. Jack Graham is taking the charge to fight the odds.\n\n(Screenshot: March for Life) Tens of thousands of people gather at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., for the 45th Annual March for Life, Jan. 19, 2018.\n\nIt all started with a sermon. At the time, I was a 30-something-year-old pastor leading a congregation in South Florida and caring for a young family.\n\nAbout 10 years earlier, a woman in Texas had filed suit in the state's northern district court to obtain an abortion, back then an illegal procedure unless necessary to save the mother's life. Her name was Norma McCorvey, but she used the alias \"Jane Roe\" in court. Her case would culminate in one of the most fateful Supreme Court decisions of the 20th century, legalizing abortion in all 50 states.\n\nIn the decade after Roe v. Wade was decided, nearly 60 million abortions were performed in the U.S. That's more than all abortions in the previous two centuries combined.\n\nAs a Christian, I knew with every fiber of my being that abortion was an affront against God, who places infinite value on every human life. And my faith compelled me to speak for the millions who couldn't speak for themselves. It was on one of these occasions, during a sermon on the devastating consequences of abortion, that I felt God speak to me. He asked, \"What are you going to do about it?\"\n\nWe began a pregnancy center at First Baptist Church West Palm Beach. And when I accepted the call to lead Prestonwood Baptist Church in Dallas, Texas in 1989, I knew this \"Jesus Ministry\" was one we had to duplicate, and take a proactive stand for the life of the unborn. In 1991 we launched Prestonwood Pregnancy Center, a clinic to reach women at their point of need during unplanned pregnancies.\n\nToday, our center provides counseling, education and medical services \u2014 such as pregnancy tests and sonograms \u2014 free of charge to thousands of women and families. Throughout the years, we have served various locations in the Dallas area with mobile sonogram units, making it convenient for women to drop in for a prompt and confidential visit.\n\nIn the past 26 years, our staff, along with a wonderful group of volunteers who have a heart for this ministry, have served more than 70,000 clients, from single, pregnant women uncertain about their future to unsuspecting fathers to married couples who are in a difficult stage in life.\n\nBut here's the best part: we've seen over 42,500 women choose life for their babies! In fact, 9 out of 10 women who visited our center in 2017 chose to keep their babies.\n\nOver the years, one of the things we've learned is that we've sometimes given Roe v. Wade way too much agency. It's true, the case made abortion legal in the U.S., allowing for the killing of untold millions of babies, but the law doesn't actually force anyone to get an abortion. In our experience, most women don't really want to end their pregnancy. Oftentimes, it's economic and social pressures, and the lack of support from family and a community system, that drive expecting mothers to prematurely end their pregnancies.\n\nA recent study on the emotional effects of abortion confirms the heavy influence of outside pressures on women hesitating to carry their pregnancy to term. The study, which surveyed 987 post-abortion patients, found that 58 percent of the women had gotten an abortion to make someone else happy. In a more telling statistic, 7 out of 10 disagreed that their decision \"was entirely free from even subtle pressure from others to abort.\"\n\nBut here's the figure that broke my heart: 2 in 3 said, \"They knew in their hearts that they were making a mistake when they underwent the abortion.\"\n\nFor the past four and a half decades, the pro-life movement has fought tooth and nail for the right to life of the unborn. We want America to wake up and realize that abortion from whichever perspective you look at it \u2014 morally, ethically and, yes, we believe even legally \u2014 is wrong. And we'll do anything in our power to see the day when no more babies are aborted in America. But we cannot get lost in a war of words and forget where the battle is actually fought. If we care about the babies, we need to start caring for the mothers.\n\nCompared to America's mammoth abortion machine, our pregnancy center seems like putting a Band-Aid on an gushing wound. But I've always noted that the famous saying \"It's better to light a candle than curse the darkness\" is apropos in this battle. I can't help but think what would happen if every woman pressed to get an abortion had access to the support and resources of a center like ours. Abortion might remain legal, but fewer women would turn to it as a solution.\n\nFor us, fighting abortion means investing our resources to help as many women and their babies as possible. Praise God, we've saved 42,500 lives so far ... and we're still counting.\n\nDr. Jack Graham is the pastor of Prestonwood Baptist Church, one of the largest and most dynamic churches in America.

These distinctions can be helpful, but they can also be a little dangerous. When Luther struggled with that, he made this distinction, which has since become somewhat famous: He distinguished between what he called a servile fear and a filial fear.\n\nThe servile fear is a kind of fear that a prisoner in a torture chamber has for his tormentor, the jailer, or the executioner. It's that kind of dreadful anxiety in which someone is frightened by the clear and present danger that is represented by another person. Or it's the kind of fear that a slave would have at the hands of a malicious master who would come with the whip and torment the slave. Servile refers to a posture of servitude toward a malevolent owner.\n\nLuther distinguished between that and what he called filial fear, drawing from the Latin concept from which we get the idea of family. It refers to the fear that a child has for his father. In this regard, Luther is thinking of a child who has tremendous respect and love for his father or mother and who dearly wants to please them. He has a fear or an anxiety of offending the one he loves, not because he's afraid of torture or even of punishment, but rather because he's afraid of displeasing the one who is, in that child's world, the source of security and love.\n\nI think this distinction is helpful because the basic meaning of fearing the Lord that we read about in Deuteronomy is also in the Wisdom Literature, where we're told that \"the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\" The focus here is on a sense of awe and respect for the majesty of God. That's often lacking in contemporary evangelical Christianity. We get very flippant and cavalier with God, as if we had a casual relationship with the Father. We are invited to call Him Abba, Father, and to have the personal intimacy promised to us, but still we're not to be flippant with God. We're always to maintain a healthy respect and adoration for Him.\n\nOne last point: If we really have a healthy adoration for God, we still should have an element of the knowledge that God can be frightening. \"It is a frightening thing to fall into the hands of the living God\" (Heb. 10:31). As sinful people, we have every reason to fear God's judgment; it is part of our motivation to be reconciled with God.\n\nThis article was originally published at Ligonier.org What Does it Mean to Fear God?Ligonier Ministries was founded by Dr. R.C.

Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away.\" (Matthew 27:58-60)\n\nThe Shroud of Turin is an ancient, sepia-colored, rectangular, 14.3 x 3.7 foot linen cloth woven in a three-to-one herringbone twill composed of flax fibrils with the front and the back image of a naked man with his hands folded across his groin on it. It is considered to be the linen cloth the dead Jesus was wrapped in after He was crucified. Some have concluded it is the true burial shroud of Jesus. Others have pronounced it a medieval forgery. In my opinion, the evidence completely disproves it being a medieval forgery...\n\n1. A set of tests conducted on the Shroud place the cloth to the time ranging from 300 B.C. to 400 A.D., well within the time of Jesus of Nazareth (Stanglin, USA Today, 2013).\n\n2. The bloodstains, as forensic scientists and chemists now know, were created by real blood, specificallyblood of a torture victim. In addition to that, an x-ray-taken showed excess iron in blood areas, as expected for blood. Microchemical tests for proteins were positive in blood areas but not in any other parts of the Shroud. Furthermore, claims are that the blood has been confirmed as authentic hemoglobin and identified as Type AB!\n\n3. Microscopic traces of the flowers, and pollen, has been found throughout the Turin Shroud. Out of hundreds of flowers on the Shroud,twenty-eight of them grow in Israel. Twenty grow in Jerusalem itself, and the other eight grow potentially within the close vicinity of Jerusalem (Whanger and Whanger, Duke.edu, 2015). Of these twenty-eight plants, twenty-seven of the identified plants are in bloom in March and April.\n\nJesus was crucified in Jerusalem during the Passover in the Spring of c. 30 AD. (Matthew 26:12; Mark 14:1; Luke 22:1,7: John 18:28) Half of the floral images and pollen grains from the plants are found only in the Middle East or other similar areas but never in Europe, the favored location of the forgery of the Shroud. Most of the flowers were clustered around the head and chest of the man on the Shroud - consistent with Jewish burial custom in Jesus' time.The pollen also dates to the first-century, further indication that the Shroud was first found in first-century Israel. In addition, many grains of the pollen, Gundelia tournefortii, have been identified. This particular pollen has large thorns, blooms in Israel between March and May, and most of the grains of this pollen have been recovered near the man's shoulder! Could it have been the crown of thorns (Matthew 27:29)?\n\n\"In addition to being unable to explain so many things about the Shroud of Turin, did it ever occur to modern skeptics that no medieval forger would have been able to forge pollen grains and floral images. Pollen grains are able to be seen only through a microscope. A medieval artist/forger did not even KNOW about individual GRAINS of pollen, could never ever have seen a microscopic grain of pollen\u2014until the 1800's AD.\"\u2014Sandra Sweeny Silver\n\n4. The image is not a stain, it is not painted on the Shroud, nor is it burned on. Instead, it is seared on to the cloth with a technology that has yet to be explained. Scientists can't even reproduce it with modern technology, let alone medieval technology! Nothing existed in medieval or ancient times that could produce such an X-ray as this. The only explanation would be some sort of large burst of radiation, that was emitted as Jesus was resurrected from the dead, creating the image on the cloth. The process causing the yellowness of the top most fibers of the threads responsible for the image is also unknown.\n\nItalian scientist Paolo DiLazzaro tried for five years to replicate the image and concluded that it was produced by ultraviolet light, but the ultraviolet light necessary to reproduce the image \"exceeds the maximum power released by all ultraviolet light sources available today.\" The time for such a burst \"would be shorter than one forty-billionth of a second, and the intensity of the ultra violet light would have to be around several billion watts.\"\n\n5. The image of the man on the Shroud can be read by 3D imaging technology, something that paintings can't do. The image on the Shroud is also only a few fibers deep. The image on the Shroud is not a painting, and that's a fact!\n\n6. The type of cloth is consistent with fabrics from first-century Israel, but not with medieval Europe. A forger would have had to not only forge the image, but would have had to have detailed knowledge of linen weaves of the first century and then not only reproduce it, but age it convincingly.\n\n7. Usually, whenever there's a picture depicting the crucifixion of Jesus, it shows the nail prints in the palms of the hand. However, modern science has shown that a nail through the middle of the palm of a man's hand would not be sufficient to hold most of the weight of a man on a cross. The nail would tear through the hand. The placement of the nails in crucifixion was most likely in the wrist.\n\nThe Turin Shroud shows the nail marks at the lower part of the hand into the wrist, just as expected! Also, experiments conducted on cadavers note that the Turin Shroud accurately depicts how crucifixions would have transpired. In addition, the whip markings on the man's back match the ends of the flagrums used by the first-century Romans for scourgings, his body shows signs of rigor mortis in a crucified position, some of his blood flows are post mortem, and it even shows marks indicating a spear wound - consistent with John 19:34. It matches the details of Jesus' crucifixion accurately!\n\nThe evidence seems highly probable that the Turin Shroud is genuinely the cloth that covered Jesus of Nazareth before His amazing resurrection from the dead. However, we do not need to rely solely on the Shroud of Turin to provide evidence for the resurrection of Jesus, since the evidence from both Christian and non-Christian sources alone are enough to verify the reliability of the crucifixion and resurrection account. See: Historical Evidence For Jesus' Resurrection.\n\nChristian Evidence was created to enable Christians to defend their faith, and to open their eyes up to the overwhelming evidence for Christianity. We hope to answer many common questions people have regarding Christianity, as well as displaying the overwhelming evidence for creation, evidence against evolution, the amazing end time prophecies that have unfolded before our eyes, and the incredible proofs of God. Any questions you have, feel free to ask. Signs are all around of the end times, which should encourage us to spread the gospel!

Peter Cary Peterson was once featured in a show about wealthy teenagers living in Manhattan. The two have been close friends since they were kids.\n\nLast weekend, they were married in Las Vegas. The event made national headlines because Tiffany Trump was a flower girl. Is this a case of two friends who fell in love and got married out of romantic passion? Not at all.\n\nYahoo reported: \"Tiffany Trump's friends just entered a sexless marriage, which isn't a terrible idea.\" Esme called her marriage \"unconventional\" and explained: \"Peter and I are not romantically involved\u2013in fact we are still dating others and will continue to seek love in all its forms\u2013we are just each other's hearts and wish to begin our journey towards evolution, because the more we face reality, the more we can see that there is no right or wrong.\"\n\nA licensed therapist affirmed their decision: \"We don't need to get married for any of the reasons we used to. Once you've got everything else in place, it is like the cherry on top.\" Another psychologist explained: \"A lot of these sorts of marriages are in response to society getting increasingly isolated, and people want to create a kinship model.\"\n\nBrown's response to her wedding is the mantra of our age: \"We have one life. Free yourself!\"\n\n\"Keep moving forward with God's strength and guidance\"\n\nGod created marriage as a covenant between a man and a woman built on unconditional love (Genesis 2:18-24; Ephesians 5:21-33). When he gave the first man and woman to each other, he told them to \"be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth\" (Genesis 1:28). However, our culture's definition of marriage has obviously departed drastically from God's design in recent years.\n\nPrior to Roe v. Wade, unborn children were protected by law; Americans now abort more than 650,000 babies each year. We once valued the sanctity of life until natural death; today, 73 percent of Americans support legalized euthanasia. This percentage has more than doubled since 1951.\n\nThe news is not all negative by any means. As Janet Denison noted in her latest blog, Christians can still influence society in significant ways. The continuing response to Target's dressing room policy illustrates the power of Christians who coalesce around a moral issue. The popularity of Chick-fil-A and Hobby Lobby show that companies can take strong Christian stands in our culture.\n\nBut as Janet noted, there is also much work to be done, so we must \"keep moving forward with God's strength and guidance.\"\n\nTo that end, consider a biblical event that serves as a parable for cultural engagement today.\n\nA brick in one hand and a sword in the other\n\nNehemiah 4 finds the people of Israel at work rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem. In a day without national armies or police forces, a city's walls were essential to its security. Without such walls, Jerusalem could not be repopulated.\n\nHowever, the project faced enormous opposition from Israel's enemies who understood the strategic significance of this construction project. As a result, half of the people worked on the wall, while half \"held the spears, shields, bows, and coats of mail\" (v. 16). In addition, \"Those who carried burdens were loaded in such a way that each labored on the work with one hand and held his weapon with the other\" (v. 17).\n\nThis metaphor seems powerful to me: rebuilding the nation with a brick in one hand and a sword in the other. We are to work for the best while preparing for the worst.\n\nIf you're traveling by air and worried about the flu, you should pray for God's protection. But you should also clean common surfaces on the airplane and avoid crowds wherever you can.\n\nIf you're a parent, you should pray for your children to be protected from the devastation of pornography. But you should also use resources such as Covenant Eyes to provide real-time accountability and other support.\n\nIf you're concerned about the moral direction of our culture, you should pray for spiritual awakening each day. But you should also look for ways to impact the lives you touch today.\n\n\"He did what he could\"\n\nOn Wednesday, a drone flew to two distressed swimmers off the coast of Australia and dropped a self-inflating rescue pod into the water, saving their lives. Scientists have now developed a blood test that can detect early signs of eight kinds of cancer. But neither the drone nor the blood test can help people unless they are taken to those who need them.\n\nA brick in one hand and a sword in the other is an image for rebuilding the spiritual walls of our culture. We should be positive and proactive in sharing God's love with our world (Matthew 22:39). But we should also be ready to \"contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints\" (Jude 3).\n\nKnow that God has given you all you need to fulfill your Kingdom assignment. Your brick is the right size for the wall you are called to build. Your sword is sharp enough for the battle you are called to wage. In Bread for the Journey, Henri Nouwen notes: \"We are good enough to do what we are called to do.\"\n\nDwight Moody said, \"If I could go down to my grave and have it honestly written above it, 'He did what he could,' I would rather have it than a monument of gold reaching to heaven.\" Do you agree?\n\nFirst published at the Denison Forum.\n\nAdapted from Dr. Jim Denison's daily cultural commentary at www.denisonforum.org .

Blockchain Stocks Are Next!\n\nRavens Shouldn\u2019t Pursue Free Agent Wideout\n\nI know what you\u2019re probably thinking. A talented 25-year-old proven receiver hits the market and you\u2019d rather Ravens NOT pursue him?\n\nAs crazy as that sounds 1. I haven\u2019t been drinking; and 2. I have sound reasoning why this isn\u2019t the best idea considering all the factors we know going in.\n\nThe \u201dHero\u201d Complex\n\nOne guy won\u2019t fix the damage done here. The wide receiver position in Baltimore has been either neglected or patched up with band aids and gum for much of the team\u2019s existence. Big splashes win offseason awards, and while I\u2019m not opposed to them in principle, the Ravens have to put more resources into the position \u2013 one big free agent signing won\u2019t be a quick fix.\n\nAlso, would a splash like this make the team a bit complacent? I worry that they wouldn\u2019t have the will nor the remaining resources to address the position as aggressively as they should the rest of the way, were they to land a catch like Landry to quiet the fans currently storming the castle.\n\nAs for Landry himself\u2026\n\nSkill Set\n\nI\u2019m a big fan of Landry\u2019s game. He\u2019s tough, competitive, has great ball skills andis tremendous in the open field. I know it\u2019s cliche but he really does play like a Raven. In a vacuum he\u2019d be a great fit.\n\nStill, he isn\u2019t what i call a \u201ctable setter.\u201d Table setters have gravity, they draw attention and create looks for everyone else on the field by their sheer presence. As good as Landry is, he isn\u2019t that guy. While Chris Moore is probably best suited as a 4th receiver, Landry is primarily a slot guy, which means you\u2019ll still need two additional snap-worthy players to play on the outside in three-wide sets.\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but i want my \u201csplash\u201d acquisition to solve more problems than that.\n\nFinancial\n\nAnd here is where that table setter thing gets tricky. Reports have surfaced that Landry is looking for upwards of $3 million per season. That\u2019s table setter money for a team that isn\u2019t exactly flush with cap flexibility.\n\nNow i have no doubt if the team really wants Landry they\u2019ll figure out how to meet that price tag, but what\u2019s the collateral damage? It\u2019s hard to imagine there being much space left over to address other needs on the roster. Even without a splash like this the team will have its hands full trying to maneuver in free agency.\n\nI envisioned a move of this magnitude last year. But the team ended up being ravaged by inuries, did some costly restructures and will probably have to hold on to a couple pricier vets because of said injuries (Brandon Carr, Austin Howard). I just don\u2019t see such a move as realistic this offseason.\n\nThe Draft\n\nThis class is chock full of talented slot receivers: Christian Kirk, Anthony Miller, Trey Quinn and D.J. Moore, to name a few. These are guys you could draft in rounds 2 through 4 for a fraction of the cost.\n\nNow, i know that face you\u2019re probably making\u2026\n\nI make it too when talking about the Ravens and drafting receivers but hey, they were rumored to really like Juju Smith-Schuster and Cooper Kupp and passed on both to address the defense. With the team being so lopsided at this point they really have no choice but to flip their approach to the 2017 Draft.\n\nNow lets hope they again identify the right under-the-radar guys but this time pull the trigger and select them.\n\nLandry would be a terrific addition to the roster but the Ravens don\u2019t have a ton of resources to make the team better. I think they\u2019d be better served spreading their capital, whether that be draft or free agency (or both), to acquire as much pass-catching talent as they can.\n\nShould the Ravens pursue Jarvis Landry?

Hawaii wouldn't come under the jurisdiction of American Episcopalians until after the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893.\n\nExpand | Collapse (PHOTO: DENNIS LENNOX)\n\nDesigned by London architects William Slater and R. H. Carpenter, it is inspired by the style of 12th century French Gothic. And while the architecture is interesting and well executed, the cathedral is a notable example of prefabricated construction \u2014 its stained glass windows, pointed arches and columns were sent piece-by-piece in ships for assembly in Honolulu. This was quite the logistical and architectural feat, as the Panama Canal wouldn't open until 1914.\n\nWhile Kamehameha IV's heir, Kamehameha V, laid the cornerstone in 1867 the first services weren't held until Christmas Day 1886, when the quire and part of the nave were ready. Construction continued until 1958, when the six-bay nave, narthex, vestibule and the west front with its magnificent floor-to-ceiling stained glass window were finished.\n\nInside, the church is furnished fairly typical of Gothic Revival churches.\n\nOf particular interest are the stained glass windows, which are attributed to the prominent London glassmakers Clayton and Bell. A keen eye will also be drawn to the circa 1862 Caen stone font, which was gifted for the baptism of the prince of Hawaii by the widow of Arctic explorer Sir John Franklin.\n\nSpires and Crosses is published every week.\n\nDennis Lennox writes about travel, politics and religious affairs.

To quote Perkins directly from his interview with Erin Burnett on CNN, \"Yes, evangelicals, conservatives, they gave him a mulligan. They let him have a do-over. They said we'll start afresh with you and we'll give you a second chance.\"\n\nOn the one hand, I can understand the outrage. We evangelicals didn't give Bill Clinton a mulligan, and we're certainly not giving Harvey Weinstein a mulligan. And since we claim to be champions of marital fidelity and sexual purity, we could not have picked a worst poster boy for our cause \u2013 at least that is what we're told.\n\nAs Michael Gerson wrote in the Washington Post, \"The Trump evangelicals have lost their gag reflex.\" Yes, we evangelicals have made our \"political bargain with open eyes.\"\n\nTrump, Gerson argues, \"has made profanity an unavoidable part of our political culture. He is in the midst of a gathering corruption scandal that has left close aides under indictment. He tells repeated and obvious lies. He incites ethnic and racial resentment as a political strategy and was caught on tape bragging about sexual assault. Add to this something that could never be said of Nixon: the credible accusation that Trump paid hush money to a porn star to cover up an affair.\"\n\nAnd how does Franklin Graham respond to this? \"We certainly don't hold him up as the pastor of this nation and he is not. But I appreciate the fact that the president does have a concern for Christian values, he does have a concern to protect Christians whether it's here at home or around the world, and I appreciate the fact that he protects religious liberty and freedom.\"\n\nFor Gerson and others, this is the height of hypocrisy, and there is no excuse for the fact that, in his words, Trump evangelicals have become \"sycophants, cheerleaders and enablers.\"\n\nFrom my perspective, to the extent we have minimized Trump's past transgressions or turned him into a modern-day saint, there is some truth to these allegations. We have lost our moral compass.\n\nBut that is only one side of the story, and this is what many people find impossible to grasp: We voted for Donald Trump with our eyes wide open and without compromising our faith.\n\nIf he did, in fact, have a fling with this porn star (which he denies) and pay to keep her quiet, we would not be surprised. And when he does use profanity (as many other presidents did before him), we are not surprised. And when he's caught in a lie, we are not surprised. Grieved, yes; surprised, no.\n\nWe don't overlook his past transgressions, we don't hail him as the exemplar of marital fidelity, and we don't say to our constituents, \"Follow Trump, as he follows Christ\" (to echo Paul's words in 1 Corinthians 11:1).\n\nRather, we say this: Babies are being slaughtered by Planned Parenthood, and this flawed man is willing to help us stop the slaughter. Christians are being massacred by ISIS, and this flawed man is willing to help stop the bloodshed. Our religious liberties are being threatened, and this flawed man is willing to take a stand on our behalf.\n\nSo, we appreciate him, we support him in carrying out his campaign promises, and as best as we can, behind closed doors and in other settings, we encourage him to step higher and to take the claims of Jesus seriously.\n\nHow is that hypocritical? How is that immoral? How is that compromised?\n\nWe weren't impressed when he held up his family Bible during the campaign, and we weren't surprised when he couldn't quote a single verse from memory. We know the man we voted for.\n\nAnd he knows who he is too, saying in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, \"At this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical community because, I will tell you what, the support they have given me \u2014 and I'm not sure I totally deserve it \u2014 has been so amazing. And has been such a big reason I'm here tonight. They have much to contribute to our policies.\"\n\nA political insider even told me that, during the campaign, when he asked Trump to take a strong stand on a marriage-related issue, he said, \"I can't do that, given my history.\"\n\nI can't confirm this firsthand (although my source says he heard it for himself), but I can confirm that I've never heard Trump put himself forward as a paragon of marital virtue, which would make sense.\n\nAs for giving him a mulligan, that's what you call the gospel. God forgives us, and we forgive others, especially if they recognize their guilt and seek to make positive changes.\n\nTo this very moment, I feel confident that if Bill Clinton came forward and confessed to his past adulteries, taking full responsibility, seeking to make restitution, and asking for forgiveness, we would line up to be the first to forgive publicly. And should he then say, \"I've had a change of heart regarding abortion,\" we would welcome him as a colleague on the front lines of the pro-life movement.\n\nIn certain ways, Trump has presented more of a mixed bag in that he continues to engage in unchristian behavior while, at the same time, making a clear break with his past. Yet he has consistently welcomed evangelical Christians into his life, he has listened attentively when they have spoken to him, and, to my knowledge, he has never rebuffed their calls for him to change.\n\nSo, while he remains a work in progress, he continues to champion many important causes, and with all his blemishes, he is our president.\n\nDo we not, then, grant him a mulligan when it comes to his past? And if we were to learn that he committed adultery 50 times in his former life, would this change our view of him today?\n\nTo repeat: We voted for him with our eyes wide open (at least, most of us did), and we can support him, with the necessary caveats, without denying or compromising our faith.\n\nWhat's so scandalous about that?\n\nEngaging views and analysis from outside contributors on the issues affecting society and faith today.\n\nCP VOICES do not necessarily reflect the views of The Christian Post.

After struggling with this reality for eight years we felt like our dreams of having children were shattered. We turned to adoption, thinking it would be a quick and easy solution. What we discovered was that it was time-consuming with a lot of paperwork and hoops to jump through. After all that we had to wait to be selected by a birth mom.\n\nWe persevered, and our lives changed forever after adopting two children at birth. They are our joy and their birth moms are the very definition of courage.\n\nWhen faced with unexpected and difficult life situations, they each made the selfless choice to carry their babies to term and place them for adoption. There can be profound feelings of loss for mothers who make that hard choice, so it's hard to fully express the deep gratitude and humility I carry as an adoptive parent. Our children's birth mothers made that hard choice, and now we have the incredible responsibility and joy of raising two precious kids.\n\nYet, too many expecting mothers make a different choice. Despite the rapid change in public opinion related to abortion largely influenced by modern science, in the United States alone we still abort 1.2 million babies annually. At the same time, there are four to five million couples waiting to adopt a baby. In fact, statistics tell us that for every baby placed for adoption there are 36 couples waiting for their turn to adopt. Think about that: we could literally adopt every single baby destined to be aborted in 2018.\n\nI wonder how many women wrestling with the decision to abort might choose life if they knew there was already a home awaiting their baby even before it was born?\n\nAs a Christian, I believe that a person's value is not determined by ethnicity, race, gender, age, ability, citizenship, or any other identifying factor. Our dignity is not based on our abilities, whether we are able to care for ourselves or our competence to perform tasks.\n\nInstead, a person's value is based on being made in the likeness of God; it is a divine and irrevocable membership in the human family. All men, women and children (including preborn children in the womb) should be respected, regardless of their mental capacity, physical ability or social position.\n\nNo matter what we do or say, our human dignity should not be forfeited or diminished.\n\nThat's why I'm marching in the 45th annual March for Life in Washington D.C., joining thousands of others who care deeply about the sanctity of life. As an adoptive parent, I feel an obligation to do my part to advocate for life. My heart longs for our culture to value life from birth to death.\n\nBeing pro-life means so much more than defending unborn children. It means a commitment to caring for people through every season of life. For example, there are thousands of children in the foster care system whose lives could be drastically changed by adoption. We also have a duty to make sure our elderly receive the intentional care and support they need to feel comfortable and loved as they face end of life issues.\n\nFor my husband and me, adopting two children has been a remarkable journey filled with ups and downs, one we've been so glad to have made. My prayer is that no woman would feel her only option is to abort her baby, but that she would know there's a home already waiting for her child.\n\nMegan West hosts My Faith Votes LIVE, a forum for conversation on the importance of faith in American politics.

And he showed (at least partially) one such deceased man. What is going on?\n\nExpand | Collapse Dr. Jerry Newcombe is a key archivist of the D. James Kennedy Legacy Library, a spokesman and cohost of Kennedy Classics.\n\nSuicide has been in the news lately. An internet-video star explored a forest in Japan where people go to hang themselves. And he showed (at least partially) one such deceased man. This video caused understandable backlash.\n\nAlso there's the news about a designer that promoted a fashion belt using a photo of a model with the belt around her neck (with the word \"hanger\" on her shirt)---seeming to suggest suicide. This caused such an uproar that the advertiser has taken down the images.\n\nFinally, Olympic swimming champion (winner of 28 medals) Michael Phelps admitted that he had contemplated suicide and is now extremely grateful he did not pursue it.\n\nMental health treatment for Phelps' depression helped, and today he helps others by sharing his story. He says he cherishes helping others come out of depression more \"than winning the Olympic gold medal.\" Phelps concludes: \"I am extremely thankful that I did not take my life.\"\n\nAll this gets me to thinking about the subject of taking one's life. Suicide, of course, is not new. One man said, \"Just as I choose a ship to sail in or a house to live in, so I choose a death for my passage from life.\" That was from Seneca, who lived from 4 BC-AD 65.\n\nThe National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) says on its website (nimh.nih.gov): \"Over 40,000 people die by suicide each year in the United States; it is the 10th leading cause of death overall. Suicide is complicated and tragic but it is often preventable.\"\n\nLook for the potential warning signs of those you know. The NIMH lists the following as potential \"signs that someone is thinking about suicide,\" including:\n\n\u2022Talking about wanting to die or wanting to kill themselves\n\n\u2022Talking about feeling empty, hopeless, or having no reason to live\n\n\u2022Using alcohol or drugs more often\n\n\u2022Acting anxious or agitated\n\n\u2022Withdrawing from family and friends\n\n\u2022Giving away important possessions\n\n\u2022Saying goodbye to friends and family\n\n\u2022Putting affairs in order, making a will.\"\n\nThe American Foundation for Suicide Prevention encourages those contemplating suicide to instead call 1-800-273-TALK.\n\nThe Bible, far from advocating suicide, only shows it as a wicked act. There are five examples of suicide in the Scripture, of course, that of Judas Iscariot being the most prominent. That is not to say that all who fall prey to an act of depressed desperation are wicked; but it is to say that suicide is considered a wicked act.\n\nIn our book, What If Jesus Had Never Been Born?, D. James Kennedy and I wrote: \"Christianity has long been a foe of suicide, in the ancient world and now in the modern world. Today the neo-pagan view is cheapening the value of human life all over again. In recent years, one of the nation's best-selling books was a how-to manual on suicide.\"\n\nI knew someone personally who was going to commit suicide. He happened to go into his boss's office at 7:00 in the morning. The lights were off, which usually meant the boss wasn't there. Then my friend went to the window and started to open it---in order to jump out and plunge to his death several stories below.\n\nSuddenly, out of the blue, he heard a voice, saying, \"Smith, what are you doing?\" Smith claimed he was just trying to open the window to get some fresh air---in his boss's office 90 minutes before work? That young man later went on to become a Christian and was exceedingly grateful that he had not succeeded in his suicide attempt. So are those of us who knew him.\n\nOur lives are not our own. Therefore, they are not our own to take. I realize sometimes people lose their minds and end up killing themselves. Meanwhile, anyone of sound mind who willfully takes his life should be aware the spiritual consequences.\n\nI remember one time at a Christian radio station I received a call from a listener who was distraught. His wife had left him, and he wanted to end it all. He asked me if he, as a Christian, would still go to heaven even if he killed himself. I told him that it would be awful to find out the hard way that he wouldn't. He called me a few months later, very happy he had not killed himself---and that his wife had come back to him.\n\nSometimes we can go through difficult periods. Perhaps they are times of testing.

Those responsible for the NASB need to fix the error.\n\nExpand | Collapse Michael Brown holds a Ph.D. in Near Eastern Languages and Literatures from New York University. He is the author of 25 books and hosts the nationally syndicated, daily talk radio show, the Line of Fire.\n\nThe NASB is one of the most widely used modern translations of the Bible, and there is not the slightest hint that the translation is anti-Israel, let alone anti-Semitic. So, my question comes by way of interest and curiosity, not by way of indictment or accusation. Why would this fine translation introduce the word \"Palestine\" in its section headings? This would be similar to a history book carrying the caption, \"Christopher Columbus discovers the United States.\" Or, \"The rule of Genghis Khan extends into the Soviet Union.\" Or, \"T. E. Lawrence was famously known as 'Lawrence of Saudi Arabia.'\"\n\nAll of these would be grossly anachronistic.\n\nYet none of my examples are as anachronistic as what is consistently found in various editions of the NASB, including print editions (the one in front of me is printed by Cambridge University Press) and various digital versions (for example, on Bible Gateway, Bible Hub, and the Laridian PocketBible, which is found in the Logos app).\n\nAs a colleague (and long-time reader of the NASB) pointed out to me today, in several places in the translation, \"Palestine\" is introduced in the section headings.\n\nAnd so, the print edition carries this section heading before Joshua 10:29: \"Joshua's Conquest of Southern Palestine.\" Similarly, each of the digital versions I mentioned carries this heading before Joshua 11:1: \"Northern Palestine Taken.\"\n\nIn contrast, other modern Bible translations have this heading before Joshua 11:1 on the Bible Gateway website: \"Joshua's Conquest of the North\" (Lexham); \"Conquests in Northern Canaan\" (ESV); \"Israel Defeats a Northern Coalition\" (NET); \"The Northern Campaign\" (ISV); \"Conquest of Northern Cities\" (CSB); \"The Northern Conquest\" (NKJV); \"Northern Kings Defeated\" (MEV); \"Conquering the North\" (TLV).\n\nOnly the NASB mentions Palestine.\n\nThe problem, of course, is that \"Palestine\" did not exist at that time, and if a place name was needed, then \"Canaan\" would have sufficed (as per the ESV).\n\nAnd while it's true that these section headings are not part of the Bible translation proper (I've been involved in a few translation projects, and our focus is always on the actual biblical text), it's also true that they can become as fixed as the translation itself, hence the appearance of \"Palestine\" in both print and digital editions of the NASB.\n\nAgain, I'm not implying anything sinister, since the NASB renders one key passage in a way that I would say is not only accurate but also refuted a supersessionist interpretation. (By \"supersessionist\" I refer a wrong interpretation in which the Church is seen as spiritual Israel and in which there are no national promises for physical Israel. Thus the Church supersedes Israel.)\n\nSpecifically, the NASB translators (along with most other modern translators) recognized that Paul was not addressing Gentile believers in Galatia as \"the Israel of God\" (see Galatians 6:16; contrast the NIV), as if these Gentile Christians had become the new Israel and had displaced the old Israel. (Here, in this verse, \"the Israel of God\" refers most likely to Jewish believers in Jesus, called Messianic Jews today.) Had there been an anti-Israel bias, it would likely have been reflected here.\n\nSo, at the risk of being redundant, I'm bringing no accusation against this popular translation, nor am I assuming that the translators themselves all agreed on the section headings.\n\nI am simply wondering out loud why they used the completely wrong term \"Palestine\" in these section headings, since \"Palestine\" did not even exist as a name for this part of the world until roughly 1,500 years after the time of Joshua's conquest. Talk about being anachronistic.\n\nBut not only so, the origins of the name Palestine are totally negative. That's why Tsafrir Ronen posted an article titled, \"The Invention of Palestine as a Psychological Weapon for Conquering Eretz Yisrael [the Land of Israel]\" on the Think Israel website.\n\nAs Ronen explains, \"Almost 2,000 years ago, the Roman Emperor Hadrian cursed the Jewish People and decreed that Judea should be henceforth called 'Palestine' after the Philistines, an ancient enemy of Israel that had disappeared from the world's stage more than 600 years earlier. It was his final twist of the knife and legacy after wars, massacres, persecutions, and exiles that had largely extinguished the Jewish presence from Judea.\"\n\nOr, as another website states, \"The Roman emperor Hadrian, in an effort to destroy Jews once and for all, renamed the territory of Judea (the present-day West Bank), Palaestina, after the Philistines, an Aegean people who had conquered the coast of Canaan. They appear in the Old Testament as depraved pagans and have long since vanished from history.\n\n\"Hadrian's intention was to eradicate memory of the Jewish people whom the Romans exiled from their homeland as punishment for having rebelled against them in 130 AD.\"\n\nIt is true that the Jewish people reclaimed the word \"Palestinian\" for themselves earlier last century, and so, the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra was originally the Palestine Symphony Orchestra (founded in 1936), while the original name for the Jerusalem Post was the Palestine Post (founded in 1932).\n\nIronically, this underscores the fact that the Arabs and others living in Palestine before 1948 did not think of themselves as Palestinians. This was never part of their corporate or individual identity until after 1967. (See here for example; as Ronen noted, \"Today, the modern enemies of a resurrected Jewish Nation have dusted off Hadrian's curse and are attempting to pull off a monumental theft: the Arab world have reincarnated 'Palestine' to steal Israel's heritage and the Land of the Jewish People.\")\n\nBut, when it comes to Bible history, especially Old Testament history, there is no such entity known as \"Palestine,\" and there is absolutely no justification for its presence in the section headings of the NASB (or, any other Bible for that matter) when talking about biblical events.\n\nIt's one thing to talk about Mark Twain visiting Palestine in the 1800's (when it was actually known by that name). It's another thing to talk about Joshua conquering Palestine.\n\nTo do so is to agree with the anti-Israel talking points of Palestinian activists, who also claim that the ancient Israelites engaged in the ethnic cleansing of Palestine (those evil Israelis are doing it again today!) and that Jesus was \"a Palestinian messenger.\"\n\nI look forward to the those currently responsible for the NASB rectifying this error.\n\nUpdate: I have been informed that the 2019 revision of the NASB already planned to replace \"Palestine\" with \"Canaan\" in these section headings.\n\nEngaging views and analysis from outside contributors on the issues affecting society and faith today.\n\nCP VOICES do not necessarily reflect the views of The Christian Post.

The enemy will do whatever he can to destroy the ministry of your pastors. Will you consider praying for your pastors in these specific areas?\n\nPray for wisdom for your pastor. These leaders are often confronted with incredibly challenging situations and decisions. They need God's wisdom to continue to be the leader of the church God has called them to be. Pray for your pastor's protection. Your pastor will be attacked in so many different ways. Your pastor will be tempted again and again. The enemy seeks to destroy. The Enemy wants your pastor's ministry destroyed. Pray for your pastor's family. They too are attacked, criticized, and sometimes bullied. They often feel isolated and alone. They need encouragement. They need prayer. Pray for your pastor to withstand the critics and bullies. Some of the critics and bullies are overt and aggressive. Others are passive aggressive. All are painful. And every pastor has them. Pray against discouragement from comparison. Before this week is over, a church member will likely tell your pastor to listen to a podcast by another pastor \"to learn how to really preach\" (actual words spoken to a pastor). Other pastors will hear numerous comments about the other great church in the community. The message is real and painful: You don't measure up, pastor. Pray against discouragement from members leaving. It's hard for your pastor not to take it personally. It's really hard when the departing member tells your pastor to take it personally. Pray against discouragement from decline. Two out of three congregations in North America are declining. That is a painful reality for your pastor. That is a discouraging reality for your pastor. Pray against discouragement from disunity. \"I wish I had every minute back I had to spend refereeing church members.\" Those are the actual words of one of the Church Answers' pastors I serve. The enemy loves it when church members fight one another. Pray for discernment for \"yes\" and \"no.\" Pastors are pulled in a multitude of directions. They are expected to be in so many meetings, so many social events, and so many pastoral situations. They are really expected to be omnipresent. Pray they will be able to say \"no\" more often. Pray for their families who often get the scanty leftovers of the pastor's time. Pray for financial pressures. Many pastors are underpaid. They struggle day by day with financial challenges. Actual quote from a deacon: \"I like for our pastor to be underpaid. It keeps him humble and dependent on God.\" That deacon is enjoying a life of leisure from inherited wealth. Pray for gospel opportunities. Pastors are energized when they have the opportunity to share the gospel. Unfortunately, many of them are too busy to take time to do so. The demands of the church are just too great. These pastors live lives of inverted priorities and frustrating days.\n\nDo we really want healthy churches? Do we really want to defeat the enemy in these battles?\n\nPray for your pastor.\n\nStart today.

Not only does it further the cause of religious freedom, but it recognizes that religious freedom is more than just the right to believe what we want in the privacy of our heads, homes and houses of worship. Instead it's the right to orient our lives, including our public lives, around those beliefs. And it also shines a much-needed light on what is a frontline in the battle to protect freedom of conscience and religion: hospitals and doctors' offices.\n\nAs Severino put it, \"America's doctors and nurses are dedicated to saving lives and should not be bullied out of the practice of medicine simply because they object to performing abortions against their conscience . . .\"\n\nLast week, his office released a 216-page proposed regulation entitled \"Protecting Statutory Conscience Rights in Health Care.\"\n\nNow predictably, critics jumped on the announcement. Lambda Legal said that the Division and the proposed rule \"[weaponizes] HHS's Office of Civil Rights against [the LGBT community].\"\n\nIf you're wondering what on earth they're talking about, you're not alone. Somehow, a proposal about abortion and physician-assisted suicide is actually about the LGBT community?\n\nThe proposed rule mentions \"abortion\" 155 times and \"suicide\" 29 times. We know because we counted. Now how many time does it use \"LGBT,\" or \"transgender,\" or any related term? Zero.\n\nSomeone whose response to the announcement made sense was the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. They expressed gratitude to HHS for \"taking seriously its charge to protect these fundamental civil rights.\" \"For too long,\" they said, \"we have seen medical professionals, including pro-life nurses like Cathy DeCarlo, who have been coerced by their employers into participating in abortion.\" DeCarlo, a nurse at New York's Mt. Sinai Hospital, was threatened with disciplinary action \"in May 2009 if she did not honor a last-minute summons to assist in a scheduled late-term abortion.\"\n\nThis was despite the fact that, one, DeCarlo's objection to abortion was on record, and two, there was no medical emergency involved. The Alliance Defending Freedom, representing DeCarlo, asked HHS to investigate, and it did. The result was a change in the policy at the hospital. Unfortunately, by then the damage to DeCarlo's religious freedom had already been done.\n\nThere are more than 600 Catholic hospitals in the United States, which provide one in six of the nation's hospital beds. Many view this as a terrible thing precisely because these institutions, not to mention the Protestant ones, will not go along with John Paul II called \"the culture of death.\"\n\nThe Manhattan Declaration specifically cited \"the effort to compel pro-life institutions (including religiously affiliated hospitals and clinics), and pro-life physicians, surgeons, nurses, and other health care professionals, to refer for abortions and, in certain cases, even to perform or participate in abortions.\"\n\nIf people can be compelled to participate in the taking of innocent human life, there's no limit to what can be done to violate the conscience.\n\nI'm grateful for the Administration's and Severino's commitment to protecting this religious freedom of health care workers. In doing so, they've taken an important step in protecting ours, as well.\n\nA Healthy Dose of Religious Freedom: New HHS Division to Protect Medical Professionals\n\nAs John says, this decision is good news for religious freedom advocates, especially those in the medical field here in the United States.

Blockchain Stocks Are Next!\n\n(NaturalHealth365) A Swedish medical team says they have found a natural way to lower blood sugar and battle type 2 diabetes, and you might have some in your refrigerator right now: broccoli. According to the researchers, broccoli sprouts could be a viable treatment option against this chronic disease condition.\n\nThe Lund University Diabetes Centre of Sweden oversaw the research, which found an extremely promising naturally occurring chemical in broccoli sprouts called sulforaphane. This broccoli compound was found to effectively lower blood sugar levels, assisting those with the disease and helping others to avoid type 2 diabetes.\n\nAnd, let\u2019s not forget, type 2 diabetes is a devastating illness that affects over 300 million people worldwide.\n\nCruciferous vegetables lower blood sugar naturally without negative side effects\n\nThe research took the form of a 12-week randomized placebo-controlled study. In it, 97 obese patients with type 2 diabetes were given sulforaphane powder, once per day, for 12 weeks along with their usual medication. After the study period, the participants showed a significant drop in their blood glucose levels as compared with controls receiving a placebo.\n\nIn addition to broccoli, the compound sulforaphane is found in all other cruciferous vegetables including cauliflower, Brussel sprouts and cabbage. The results were particularly dramatic in those patients with very poorly managed type 2 diabetes.\n\nAnd, just in case you might be curious, this study was published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\n\nGood news for diabetics: Try sulforaphane concentrate from broccoli sprouts\n\nThe researchers were very pleased that they were able to isolate and distil the compound sulforaphane from broccoli sprouts, as it seems to be one of its most beneficial components. The prospect of being able to provide a highly concentrated extract of broccoli to type 2 diabetes patients is an extremely exciting prospect, as it brings great healing benefits without harming the body.\n\nWhile it could become a complement to existing treatments, many drugs for diabetes are associated with risks and side effects including the possibility of kidney damage. No doubt, when working with the right physicians, there are much safer options.\n\nMore good news: Broccoli sprouts help to defeat cancer and other chronic diseases\n\nNumerous studies have already been conducted pertaining to broccoli, and they have revealed a host of health benefits from eating the cruciferous vegetable, including cancer prevention. This nutritious and tasty vegetable has been found to protect against liver cancer, prostate cancer and other diseases.\n\nWhile an extract could provide a more concentrated way to receive the benefits of broccoli, eating broccoli sprouts more regularly is also beneficial to our health. They are delicious as a raw side dish, chopped and sprinkled on salads or placed inside your favorite sandwich. Keep in mind, broccoli sprouts offer greater nutrient concentration, when compared to the mature broccoli plant.\n\nEither way, just be sure to eat fresh, organic, locally sourced broccoli as often as possible. Eating it raw or lightly steamed can help to preserve its nutrient content and health-sustaining benefits.

Range is increasing and recharge times reducing, while costs are going down\n\nAmericans must be free to buy vehicles that meet their needs!\n\n\n\nCOPPER HILL, Virginia \u2014 Imagine if there were just one kind of car you could buy and you were told by the government you had to buy. No choice, no options. One size fits all, just because. It\u2019s a ridiculous idea, of course. The reason there are different types of cars \u2014 and trucks and SUVs and everything in between \u2014 is because people have different needs.\n\nSome people need a full-size, 4WD SUV capable of carrying six adults, handling heavy snow in the winter and pulling a heavy trailer come summer; for others, a subcompact sedan that gets 40 MPG all year long makes more sense. One size, obviously, does not fit all. The car industry, operating in a free market, caters to these needs.\n\nThe same principle applies \u2014 or ought to \u2014 when it comes to what makes our cars go. There are four major choices currently available: Gasoline, gas-electric hybrid, full electric and diesel. Each way of getting a car going has its pros and cons \u2014 just as driving one type of vehicle versus a different type of vehicle entails pros and cons. Electrics, for instance, can be plugged in anywhere there\u2019s an outlet. No more having to deal with gas stations. Or gas costs. And they don\u2019t produce any tailpipe exhaust emissions \u2014 because they haven\u2019t got a tailpipe. They are classified as Zero Emissions Vehicles (ZEVs) for this reason. The latter is the main reason for the legislative/regulatory push for electric cars \u2014 including subsidies at both the manufacturing and retail level \u2014 as well as the justification for laws being passed in Europe and being contemplated here that would ban other-than-electric cars outright after a certain date \u2014 2045, in California, if a bill currently under consideration there becomes law. On the other hand, electrics are still very expensive to buy relative to an otherwise similar non-electric gas-burning or hybrid gas-electric car \u2014 even with the subsidies \u2014 which negates the EV\u2019s at-the-pump savings. And if only affluent people can afford to buy them, their emissions \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 are irrelevant. And while it\u2019s true that electrics don\u2019t emit any emissions at the tailpipe, emissions are emitted at the smokestacks at the utility plants which produce the electricity that makes EVs go.\n\nIt\u2019s very debatable whether, in the aggregate, electric cars actually do emit less emissions than conventional cars, including emissions of carbon dioxide. Modern diesel engines, on the other hand, are capable of better-than-hybrid fuel economy without the higher cost of a hybrid drivetrain and have highway ranges of 600 miles or more on a full tank \u2014 a range no other form of propulsion can match. They are also nearly emissions-free at the tailpipe, and, of course, emit nothing at the smokestack. The same goes for modern gas-burning engines. Many gas and diesel engines currently in production qualify as Partial Zero Emissions (PZEV) and even those that don\u2019t quite make that cut are extremely close to it. Many people outside the car industry do not realize that the difference in exhaust emissions between ZEV and PZEV and Super Ultra Low Emissions, the next rung on the regulatory ladder, amounts to fractions of a percent. That there is no longer any such thing as a \u201cdirty\u201d internal combustion engine \u2014 whether gas or diesel. And there\u2019s more to come, including an ultra-efficient and ultra-low-emissions hybrid gas-diesel engine being developed by Mazda. Strides are being made in terms of electric cars as well. Range is increasing and recharge times reducing, while costs are going down. But all types still have their pros and their cons, which is why it\u2019s important that people remain free to choose the form of propulsion that best meets their needs. Just as they are still free to choose the type of vehicle that best meets their needs.

This shower will reach its peak on the night of January 3rd and this is what you need to know about it.\n\nWhile we have been able to see meteors from this shower for the past week it will not peak until January 3rd and 4th during predawn hours. The radiant point of this shower seems to make an approximate right angle with the Big Dipper and the bright star Arcturus. That being said if you are in the mid-northern or far-northern latitudes you should have no trouble seeing this shower.\n\nFor those who do not know, this shower is named after a constellation that does not exist anymore. While most meteor showers are named after the constellations from which they seem to come, this one\u2019s constellation is not around anymore. The constellation this shower used to come from was called Quadrans Muralis and it no longer exists because back in 1922 the International Astronomical Union devised a list of 88 modern constellations. While this list was agreed upon it did not include the constellation Quadrans Muralis.\n\nYou do not have to use binoculars or anything of the sort to view this shower. That being said, NASA does recommend that you lie flat on your back with your feet facing the Northwest. Be patient as it can and usually will take up to 30 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the dark. The Quadrantids are thought to be made up of the debris left behind by the 2003 EH1 asteroid that NASA now believes to be a dead comet.\n\nSmithsonianmag.com says as follows in regards to viewing this shower:\n\nLike with all meteor showers, it\u2019s imperative to get as far away from cities or light sources for best viewing. But this year make sure to also bundle up appropriately\u2014or even skip the show if wind chills dip dangerously low.\n\nNow, if you happen to miss this shower there is no need to worry, January holds a lot of astrological wonders.

Astrologists and lovers of all things space-related are getting excited about the days to come with the month promising us not one, but two supermoons, a stunning meteor shower, and some fascinating planetary movement. While not all of these sights will be easily viewed with the naked eye, experts aren\u2019t predicting that they will be hard to spot with the help of a telescope or binoculars!\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to take in the sights, there are some steps you can take to optimize your stargazing efforts this month. Seek out a location further from the city, eliminating the light pollution that can interfere with your view. You also want to find a location with an open view of the sky, such as a large field, cutting back on the objects that can get in your way like tall buildings or trees. You can also cut back on fumbling in the darkness and time needed for your eyes to adjust by investing in a red flashlight or covering your cell phone with red cellophane.\n\nJanuary 1st: New Year\u2019s Supermoon\n\nThe month opened with a stunning supermoon, also known as the \u2018Wolf Moon\u2019 on day 1. A \u2018supermoon\u2019 refers to the phenomenon when the moon is full during the period of its orbit in which it is closest to the Earth. This causes the moon to appear 30% brighter and 14% larger in size than a standard full moon, and typically occur once every 13 months.\n\nJanuary 3rd/4th: Quadrantid Meteor Shower\n\nTonight\u2019s the night! While it will be a little harder to view this year\u2019s Quadrantid meteor shower due to the incredible amount of light that will still likely be coming from the moon following the supermoon, the annual show is sure to impress. The Quadrantids actually run from December 22nd to January 17th, however, during tonight\u2019s peak experts are estimating up to 40 meteors per hour, with the most meteors expected to be visible in the last hour before dawn.\n\nJanuary 4th/5th: The Meeting of Regulus and the Moon\n\nLate on the night of January 4th, and into the early hours of January 5th the moon is predicted to pass incredibly close to Regulus, a bright star that is best known for being part of the constellation Leo, the lion. Some viewers, depending on their location at the time, may even have the opportunity to watch as the star disappears behind the moon, a phenomenon called a lunar occultation.\n\nJanuary 8th: Last Quarter Moon\n\nContinuing to follow the moon phases throughout the month of January, on the 8th the moon will reach the Last Quarter. The moon will be illuminated on the eastern side, towards the pre-dawn sun, which will continue into the morning daylight hours. This is one of the few sights that you will be able to view in the light of day!\n\nJanuary 11th: The Moon Meets Mars and Jupiter\n\nIf you are fascinated by the view of the planets, tonight\u2019s occurrence is one that you don\u2019t want to miss. The waning crescent moon, Mars and Jupiter will all be seen incredibly close to one another, forming a triangular pattern in the sky, In fact, the three will be so close that they can all be seen in the field of view of binoculars at the same time.\n\nJanuary 13th/14th: Mercury, Saturn and the Moon\n\nAnother interesting sight for those that enjoy the planets, on January 13th Mercury will officially move past Saturn, putting the two incredibly close together in the night sky. As if that wasn\u2019t impressive enough, on January 14th the moon will join the others, creating a triangular pattern similar to the one that was visible with Mars, Jupiter and the moon earlier this month.\n\nJanuary 19th: Jupiter Double Shadow Event\n\nThere are times throughout the year that, when the pieces of the puzzle all fall into place, we can actually view a shadow from one of Jupiter\u2019s 4 moons as they pass across the planet. Occasionally, however, we have the opportunity to see multiple of these shadows at the same time. If you\u2019re willing to get up early enough, at approximately 4:45 AM shadows from both Europa and Ganymede can be seen.\n\nJanuary 26th/27th: Moon Eclipses the Eye of Taurus\n\nAs the moon continues to move through the constellations, it will find its way into Taurus on the night of January 26th, into the morning of January 27th. During this time, it will cross so close to Aldebaran, the bright orange star better known as the \u2018bull\u2019s eye\u2019 that the star will appear to disappear at approximately 1:53 AM, reappearing 57 later.\n\nJanuary 31st: Blue Moon, Supermoon and a Total Lunar Eclipse\n\nThis month is really going to go out with a bang, with the appearance of a blue moon, the term used to refer to a second full moon in the span of a month, which also happens to be a supermoon AND during the time the supermoon is visible, a total lunar eclipse will occur.

Theologian John Piper stirred up a hornet's nest by arguing women are not to teach men. Piper points to 1 Timothy 2:12 that churches should be led by a team of spiritual, humble, biblically qualified men.\n\n\"If it is unbiblical to have women as pastors, how can it be biblical to have women who function in formal teaching and mentoring capacities to train and fit pastors for the very calling from which the mentors themselves are excluded?\" Piper writes.\n\nYes, 1 Timothy 2:12-13 says women should not teach or assume authority over a man. Others point to 1 Timothy 3, which lists the qualifications for bishops and deacons as reasons not to allow women in ministry. But what do we do, then, with Deborah, a prophetess and a judge who led Israel into victorious battle when a man would not take charge? What about Anna the prophetess? What about Priscilla, who traveled in ministry with her husband?\n\nLook at Aimee Semple McPherson. What about Kathryn Kuhlman? How about Marilyn Hickey and Joyce Meyer? All of these women have been a blessing to the body of Christ, and they have all faced persecution from people who don't agree that they should speak and teach. Jesus certainly didn't prevent women from entering ministry so I am unsure as to why there is so much resistance in some camps within the modern church.\n\nI would like to end the heated debate over women in ministry. There are too many examples in Scripture of women serving in leadership or other key roles for men to deny women a seat at the leadership table. That said, I'm not calling for affirmative action here. Church roles should be assigned by the Holy Spirit. That means leadership needs to pray and fast without preconceived notions\u2014and without bias toward women\u2014before they appoint people to positions.\n\nPaul wrote, \"But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to everyone for the common good. To one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healings by the same Spirit, to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues. But that one and very same Spirit works all these, dividing to each one individually as He will\" (1 Cor. 12:7-11).\n\nPaul didn't say women can't operate in spiritual gifts and I don't believe Paul intended for women to be denied opportunities to serve in various ministries, even leadership positions, within the church. I think locking women out of ministry can actually work against God at times. God is the one who calls people into ministry\u2014men and women. If we were all obedient to the Holy Spirit in this matter, there would be much less strife and much more effectiveness in ministry for the glory of God.\n\nIt's going to take all of us laboring together to turn around our nation. Can we quit attacking women who are trying to do what God has called them to do?\n\nJennifer LeClaire former editor of Charisma magazine, senior leader of Awakening House of Prayer in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, founder of the Ignite Network and founder of the Awakening Blaze prayer movement.

The senior senator from Maryland personifies the highly dangerous opportunism that has set in among leading Democrats on the subject of Russia.\n\nChelsea Manning confirmed on Sunday that she is challenging Senator Cardin\u2019s re-election effort in the Democratic primary this June. Her campaign has real potential to raise key issues. One of them revolves around the kind of bellicose rhetoric that heightens the dangers of conflict between the world\u2019s two nuclear superpowers.\n\nIn a typical foray into reckless hyperbole, Cardin told a public forum in November: \u201cWhen you use cyber in an affirmative way to compromise our democratic, free election system, that\u2019s an attack against America. It\u2019s an act of war. It is an act of war.\u201d\n\nCardin is far from the only member of Congress to use \u201cact of war\u201d rhetoric about alleged Russian cyber actions. Republican ultra-hawk Arizona Senator John McCain has hurled the phrase at Russia. But the most use of the phrase comes from a range of Democrats, such as Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal and the normally sensible Northern California Representative Jackie Speier.\n\nAs his party\u2019s ranking member of the key Senate committee on foreign policy, Cardin is at the tip of the anti-Russia propaganda spear. After three decades in Congress including nearly a dozen years in the Senate, he\u2019s an old hand at spinning. No one has worked harder to get political mileage out of \u201cRussiagate.\u201d\n\nA Distorted Report\n\nLast week, Cardin upped the ante with the release of a report that he commissioned. In effect, it\u2019s a declaration of red-white-and-blue jihad against Russia.\n\nThe report \u2014 which accuses Russian President Vladimir Putin of \u201ca relentless assault to undermine democracy and the rule of law in Europe and the United States\u201d \u2014 received massive coverage in U.S. news media. Conservative and libera l punditry voiced acclaim.\n\n\u201cNever before in American history has so clear a threat to national security been so clearly ignored by a U.S. president,\u201d a solo statement by Cardin declares on the opening page. With the truly repugnant President Trump in its crosshairs, the report\u2019s most polemical claims \u2014 no matter how debatable or ahistorical \u2014 have predictably gotten a pass from mass media.\n\nBut the much-ballyhooed report is a carefully selective and distorted version of history.\n\nThe expansion of NATO up to Russia\u2019s borders, the U.S. interference in dozens of countries\u2019 elections (including in Russia during the Clinton administration), Washington\u2019s support for repressive regimes in the past and present \u2014 such realities didn\u2019t merit consideration or mention. Nor did facts such as the USA\u2019s role as the world\u2019s biggest arms merchant. Or the aggressively deadly U.S. military interventions in the recent past and present, from Afghanistan to Iraq to Libya.\n\nSuch omissions are essential to the self-righteous tone of the Russiagate frenzy. Only with silence about basic truths of U.S. foreign policy can officials in Washington pose as leaders of an angelic nation that must confront satanic Russia.\n\nIn light of what is at stake for human survival \u2014 with the odds of nuclear war shifting ominously because of the agenda that he\u2019s helping to push \u2014 Senator Cardin can be understood as someone who avidly fits into patterns of nationalistic and militaristic madness. The sad fact is that he has plenty of company on Capitol Hill.\n\nDemocratic leadership used to be much saner. Five decades ago, it was the fanatical Republican standard bearer Barry Goldwater who scorned reaching out to the Kremlin \u2013 while Democratic President Lyndon Johnson wisely sought d\u00e9tente with Russian leaders on behalf of peaceful coexistence and reducing the risks of nuclear conflagration.\n\nRight after being sentenced to prison in August 2013 for heroic whistleblowing that exposed many U.S. war crimes, Chelsea Manning released a statement that quoted Howard Zinn: \u201cThere is not a flag large enough to cover the shame of killing innocent people.\u201d A nuclear war between the United States and Russia would do more than kill vast numbers of innocent people. Scientific research tells us that a nuclear holocaust would make the Earth \u201cvirtually uninhabitable.\u201d\n\nThe extreme hostility toward Russia that makes such an outcome more likely must be rejected. Senator Ben Cardin is one of the loudest and most prominent voices for such hostility. He should be challenged.\n\nNorman Solomon is the coordinator of the online activist group RootsAction.org and the executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy.

Bush\u2019s Total Information Awareness scheme brought assurances that it had been shelved, but its Orwellian intent was only shifted to the NSA and it now gives the U.S. government nearly god-like powers, says Norman Solomon.\n\nBy Norman Solomon\n\nAs a matter of faith, some people believe that God can see and hear everything. But as a matter of fact, the U.S. government now has the kind of surveillance powers formerly attributed only to a supreme being.\n\nTop \u201cnational security\u201d officials in Washington now have the determination and tech prowess to keep tabs on billions of people. No one elected Uncle Sam to play God. But a dire shortage of democratic constraints has enabled the U.S. surveillance state to keep expanding with steely resolve.\n\nBy the time Edward Snowden used NSA documents to expose \u2014 beyond any doubt \u2014 a global surveillance dragnet, the situation had deteriorated so badly because the Bush and Obama administrations were able to dismiss earlier warnings to the public as little more than heresy.\n\nEight years ago, in the book State of War, New York Times reporter James Risen devoted a chapter to the huge expansion of surveillance. A secret decision by President George W. Bush \u201chas opened up America\u2019s domestic telecommunications network to the NSA in unprecedented and deeply troubling new ways, and represents a radical shift in the accepted policies and practices of the modern U.S. intelligence community,\u201d Risen wrote.\n\nRisen added: \u201cThe NSA is now tapping into the heart of the nation\u2019s telephone network through direct access to key telecommunications switches that carry many of America\u2019s daily phone calls and e-mail messages.\u201d\n\nMore details on the surveillance state came in 2008 with James Bamford\u2019s book The Shadow Factory, which illuminated the National Security Agency\u2019s program for \u201ceavesdropping on America.\u201d And in August of 2012 \u2014 nearly 10 months before Snowden\u2019s revelations began \u2014 filmmaker Laura Poitras released a mini-documentary on the New York Times website about the NSA\u2019s mass surveillance program.\n\nAll three journalists relied on whistleblowers who balked at the NSA\u2019s virtual mission to see and hear everything. Both books (especially State of War) depended on information from unnamed sources. The short documentary focused on a public whistleblower \u2014 former NSA executive William Binney, who continues to speak out.\n\nTestifying to a committee of the German parliament in Berlin two weeks ago, Binney \u2014 whose 30 years at the NSA included work as a high-level intelligence official \u2014 said that the NSA has a \u201ctotalitarian mentality.\u201d\n\nDays later, speaking at a conference in London, Binney explained: \u201cAt least 80 percent of fiber-optic cables globally go via the U.S. This is no accident and allows the U.S. to view all communication coming in. At least 80 percent of all audio calls, not just metadata, are recorded and stored in the U.S. The NSA lies about what it stores.\u201d\n\nSince last summer, a backup source of strength for the voices of Binney, Thomas Drake, Kirk Wiebe and other NSA whistleblowers \u2014 the fact that Snowden has provided the public with NSA documents \u2014 is exactly what has enraged U.S. officials who want to maintain and escalate their surveillance power. Because of those unveiled documents, clarity about what the NSA is really doing has fueled opposition.\n\nNSA surveillance proliferates in a context that goes well beyond spying. The same mentality that claims the right to cross all borders for surveillance \u2014 using the latest technologies to snoop on the most intimate communications and private actions of people across the globe \u2014 is also insisting on the prerogative to cross borders with the latest technologies to kill.\n\nWhen a drone or cruise missile implements an assumed right to snuff out a life, without a semblance of due process, the presidential emulation of divine intervention is implicit.\n\nBut, in military terms, dominating the world is a prohibitively expensive goal. In the digital age, surveillance has emerged as a cost-effective way to extend the U.S. government\u2019s global reach and put its intelligence capacities on steroids \u2014 while tens of billions of taxpayer dollars in annual revenues go to corporate contractors servicing the NSA, CIA and other agencies of the military-industrial-surveillance complex.\n\nSo the trend line continues to move in the wrong direction. Speaking last month at a news conference that launched ExposeFacts.org (part of the Institute for Public Accuracy, where I work), Binney said that in recent years the NSA\u2019s surveillance activity has \u201conly gotten worse.\u201d He added: \u201cI mean it\u2019s almost in everything that you do. If you do anything electronically, they\u2019re in it and they\u2019re watching you.\u201d\n\nThe information being collected is so vast that NSA operatives face a huge challenge of figuring out how to sift through it on such a large scale \u2014 \u201cbecause they have to manually look at this data,\u201d Binney said. \u201cBut the point is, they\u2019re setting the stage for this to continue to the point where everybody could be monitored almost constantly throughout the day. That is an oppressive, suppressive state.\u201d\n\nSince last summer, revelations about NSA programs have been so profuse and complex that it\u2019s difficult to gain an overview, to see the surveillance state\u2019s toxic forest for the digital trees. But the macro picture has to do with a mind-blowing agenda for monitoring the people of the world.\n\n\u201cFor me, the most significant revelation is the ambition of the United States government and its four English-speaking allies to literally eliminate privacy worldwide, which is not hyperbole,\u201d journalist Glenn Greenwald said at a news conference three months ago. \u201cThe goal of the United States government is to collect and store every single form of electronic communication that human beings have with one another and give themselves the capacity to monitor and analyze those communications.\u201d\n\nSuch a goal, formerly reserved for the more fundamentalist versions of God, is now firmly entrenched at the top of the U.S. government \u2014 and at the top of corporate America. As Greenwald pointed out, \u201cThere almost is no division between the private sector and the NSA, or the private sector and the Pentagon, when it comes to the American \u2018national security\u2019 state. They really are essentially one.\u201d\n\nNow that\u2019s the kind of monotheism the world can do without.\n\nNorman Solomon is co-founder of RootsAction.org and executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy, which recently launched ExposeFacts.org.

Of course prosecutor Eric Olshan was not foolish enough to quote Rice\u2019s most famous line: \u201cWe don\u2019t want the smoking gun to become a mushroom cloud.\u201d\n\nDuring the seven days of the trial, which received scant media coverage, Rice attracted the most attention. But little of her testimony actually got out of the courtroom, and little of what did get out illuminated the political context of the government\u2019s case against former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling.\n\nA heavy shroud over this trial, almost hidden by news media in plain sight, has been context: the CIA\u2019s collusion with the Bush White House a dozen years ago, using WMD fear and fabrication to stampede the United States into making war on Iraq.\n\nAnd part of the ongoing context of the Sterling case has been the Obama administration\u2019s unrelenting pursuit of Sterling for allegedly leaking classified information, revealed in the last chapter of a book by James Risen, about a now-15-year-old CIA operation that\u2019s far more suitable for Freedom of Information Act disclosures than criminal prosecution. The jury is weighing nine felony counts, including seven under the atrociously misapplied Espionage Act.\n\nIt was just six weeks after the invasion of Iraq when, at the end of April 2003, Rice then President George W. Bush\u2019s nationals security adviser hosted a meeting at the White House to tell representatives of the New York Times that the newspaper should not report on Operation Merlin, the CIA\u2019s ill-conceived and dangerous maneuver that had provided a flawed design for a nuclear weapon component to Iran three years earlier.\n\nThe Times management caved within a week. Only Risen\u2019s book State of War, published in January 2006, finally brought Operation Merlin to light.\n\nRice was in her usual smooth form at the Sterling trial. Emphatic that the CIA\u2019s Operation Merlin was hardly known to anyone, Rice testified: \u201cThis program was very closely held. It was one of the most closely held programs during my tenure.\u201d Yet the CIA manager in charge of Operation Merlin (\u201cBob S,\u201d who appeared at the trial behind a screen) testified that the operation was known to more than 90 people.\n\nHelping to lay groundwork for the Iraq invasion, Rice was a key enabler for the CIA\u2019s slam-dunk mendacity about Saddam Hussein\u2019s purported weapons of mass destruction. More than a decade later, she has used the Sterling trial as an opportunity for more distortion of the historical record, as though her quash-the-Merlin-story meeting at the White House in 2003 was free of self-service.\n\nThe prosecution helped Rice settle into her stance:\n\nQuestion: \u201cNow, was the purpose of your convening this meeting out of any sort of embarrassment that it would get out that there had been a botched operation?\u201d\n\nRice: \u201cMy concern in convening this meeting was that we had a very sensitive, extremely important program for the security of the country that was about to be compromised . . . That was my concern.\u201d\n\nBut one of the prosecution\u2019s main concerns, no doubt shared by Rice, had to do with insulating the trial from intrusive context, a context that could explain why any whistleblower or journalist might want to expose and debunk Operation Merlin, an operation targeting a supposed nuclear weapons program in Iran, a country that the Bush administration was eager to attack with the goal of regime change.\n\nWhen the time came for Rice to face cross-examination, defense lawyer Barry Pollack tried to blow away some fog:\n\nQuestion: \u201c[P]reventing working nuclear weapons from falling into the hands of rogue states is one of the most important missions of your, the administration you worked for certainly \u201d\n\nRice: \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nQuestion: \u201c and any other administration, correct?\u201d\n\nRice: \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d\n\nQuestion: \u201cAnd certainly counterproliferation was of great interest at this particular time, correct?\u201d\n\nRice: \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d\n\nQuestion: \u201cThe United States had invaded Iraq the earlier month?\u201d\n\nProsecutor Olshan: \u201cObjection.\u201d\n\nJudge Leonie Brinkema: \u201cWell, we\u2019ve heard that before. Let\u2019s just move this along, Mr. Pollack. Sustained.\u201d\n\nA week later, in the closing arguments, Pollack, who noted that \u201cthe government has great lawyers\u201d, told the jury: \u201cMake no mistake. This is a very important case for the government.\u201d He pointedly reminded jurors that the last chapter in Risen\u2019s book \u201cmade the CIA look bad.\u201d\n\nMinutes later, wrapping up the prosecution\u2019s closing statement, Assistant U.S. Attorney James Trump declared: \u201cThis case is not about politics. It\u2019s not about salvaging the reputation of the CIA.\u201d\n\nBut, no matter how great the government\u2019s lawyers may be, the case of United States of America v. Jeffrey Alexander Sterling has everything to do with politics and the CIA\u2019s reputation.\n\nNorman Solomon is the executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy and the author of War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death.

A year ago the head of the Air Combat Command, Gen.

In early April a researcher at the Council on Foreign Relations, Micah Zenko, calculated that President Trump had approved an average of one drone attack per day -- a fivefold increase from the rate under the Obama administration.\n\nUpstate New York is leading the way for the Pentagon's plan to expand its drone program from isolated areas into populous communities, which offer ready access to workers. One hundred and sixty miles to the west of Syracuse, just outside the city of Niagara Falls, an Air National Guard base -- the largest employer in the county -- is in the final stages of building a cutting-edge digital tech center with huge bandwidth. There, pilots and sensor operators will do shifts at computer consoles, guiding MQ-9 drones and firing missiles on kill missions. The center is on track to become fully operational in a matter of months.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAt the main gate of the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station, a sergeant from the public-affairs office was upbeat about the base \"operating the MQ-9 remotely piloted aircraft.\" At city hall the mayor of Niagara Falls, a liberal Democrat, sounded no less pleased, while carefully sidestepping my questions about whether he could see any downsides to the upcoming drone role. A local businessman who chairs the Niagara Military Affairs Council -- a private organization that has long spearheaded efforts to prevent closure of the base -- told me that getting the drone mission was crucial for keeping the base open.\n\nIn such ways, functioning locally while enabling globally, the political economy and mass psychology of militarism do the work of the warfare state.\n\nNext Page 1 | 2", "domain": "www.opednews.com", "label": 0, "url": "https://www.opednews.com/articles/2/Killer-Drones-in-the-Empir-by-Norman-Solomon-Domestic-Drones_Predator-Drone-170504-677.html"}

Pierce.\n\nBy Todd E. Pierce\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson is reportedly considering closing the Office of Global Criminal Justice, a tiny agency with a meager budget of $3 million a year, located within the State Department.\n\nAccording to its website, the office \u201cadvises the Secretary of State . . . on issues related to war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.\u201d It \u201calso coordinates U.S. Government positions relating to the international and hybrid courts currently prosecuting persons responsible for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity \u2014 not only for such crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and Cambodia \u2014 but also in Kenya, Libya, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Guatemala, and elsewhere in the world.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, it deploys \u201ca range of diplomatic, legal, economic, military, and intelligence tools to help expose the truth, judge those responsible, protect and assist victims, enable reconciliation, deter atrocities, and build the rule of law.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times reported that human rights advocates saw the proposal as an example of \u201cthe Trump administration\u2019s indifference to human rights outside North Korea, Iran and Cuba.\u201d Human rights activists also said that shutting the Office \u201cwould hamper efforts to publicize atrocities and bring war criminals to justice.\u201d Newsweek reported, however, that the Obama administration also reportedly considered downgrading the office and merging it with another agency.\n\nAccording to the Newsweek article, the office offered rewards for information on \u201cwar criminals, and has inveighed against brutal dictators, including Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\u201d But the article also noted it \u201chas not criticized Saudi Arabia or other American allies with dismal human rights records.\u201d\n\nThe same Newsweek piece explained that the office was formed following the 1996 passage of the War Crimes Act. That Act defined a war crime as a \u201cgrave breach\u201d of the Geneva Conventions. The War Crimes Act, codified as 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 2441, makes it an offense, \u201cwhether inside or outside the United States,\u201d to commit a war crime, if one is a member of the Armed Forces of the United States or a national of the United States. Newsweek writer Nina Burleigh correctly noted that when \u201cthe CIA began using torture early in the Iraq War and, later, jailing people indefinitely and without trial in Guantanamo, the U.S. was in open breach of the conventions.\u201d As noted above, the Office of Global Criminal Justice has inveighed against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. But it seemed to have had no problem with the Syrian government when CIA officials outsourced torture to the Syrian government earlier in the so-called Global War on Terror.\n\nA Symbol of Hypocrisy\n\nSo, if there was ever a U.S. government agency standing as a symbol for U.S. hypocrisy, the Office of Global Criminal Justice is it. It is not hard to see in decoding their mission statement that \u201celsewhere in the world\u201d does not mean leaders of any U.S.-allied nations.\n\nBut even more hypocritical is having a U.S. government agency charged with tasks to \u201chelp expose the truth, judge those responsible, protect and assist victims, enable reconciliation, deter atrocities, and build the rule of law,\u201d when the U.S. Department of Justice is doing the exact opposite in enforcing the War Crime Act itself.\n\nThat hypocrisy is seen in a series of cases beginning in 2006 with the decision in Rasul v. Rumsfeld, by the D.C. District Court. As law professor Steve Vladeck explained, when asked of that case in a 2006 article, \u201cIs torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment (CIDT) within the scope of government employment? At least somewhat surprisingly, . . . the answer to that question is \u2018yes.\u2019\u201d\n\nSince 2006, the principle in the decision of Rasul v. Rumsfeld that Vladeck referred to has become a time-honored principle of U.S. jurisprudence, and a symbol of U.S. hypocrisy when compared to other U.S. pronouncements on torture and war crimes, as seen in a long series of cases down to the present day.\n\nThe manner that those decisions are written eliminates all illusions that the United States government is opposed to war crimes when done by \u201ca member of the Armed Forces of the United States or a national of the United States\u201d \u2014 they have been granted impunity under the law to offend. Famously, that was expressed by President Obama when he stated that those CIA officials guilty of torture would not be held criminally accountable for acts that are defined as \u201cwar crimes,\u201d that is, torture. Little wonder that Donald Trump could so readily say he believed torture worked, since that is what many CIA officials continue to say.\n\nFailing to prosecute war crimes is in itself a war crime under international law, and, to use the words of the \u201cOffice of Global Criminal Justice,\u201d the opposite of its mission to \u201cexpose the truth,\u201d and \u201cjudge those responsible.\u201d But taking matters a step further, the U.S. government has designed a legal procedure to deny protection and assistance to victims. This is exactly what leaders of countries that are in line for U.S.-sponsored regime change are routinely accused of doing by the Office of Global Criminal Justice.\n\nShielding Torturers\n\nThe issue in a series of lawsuits involving the war crime of torture is whether former Guantanamo prisoners who were victims of U.S. government officials could sue the officials for civil damages. The courts have held, however, that government officials were entitled to immunity for the acts they had committed and were being sued for torture, as it was \u201cwithin the scope of their employment.\u201d These decisions are based on procedures based on the Westfall Act, which is too convoluted to explain here, but it serves to nullify the War Crimes Act.\n\nTypical of the language in the court\u2019s decisions is: \u201cseveral detainees were subjected to abuse \u2014 including \u2018forced grooming, solitary confinement, sleep deprivation, forced medication, transport in \u2018shackles and chains, blackened goggles, and ear coverings,\u2019 and the disruption of \u2026 religious practices\u201d \u2014 even after a CSRT had determined that there were not enemy combatants\u2026. The court held that the defendants\u2019 actions were \u2018of the kind\u2019 [they were] employed to perform,\u201d even though the mistreatment occurred when several of the plaintiffs \u201chad no intelligence value.\u201d\n\nThe court noted that \u201c[t]hough the intelligence rationale has dissipated, the need to maintain an orderly detention environment remained after CSRT clearance.\u201d The court continued: \u201cAuthorized or not, the conduct was certainly foreseeable because maintaining peace, security, and safety at a place like Guantanamo Bay is a stern and difficult business.\u201d\n\nThat was what German military and Gestapo officers said of the prisons they worked in when they went on trial for war crimes at Nuremberg. Most common as their legal defense against war crime charges was that the defendants were only following \u201csuperior orders,\u201d in German, \u201cBefehl ist Befehl\u201d (\u201corders are orders\u201d) \u2014 a tactic now known as the Nuremberg defense. In other words, the earlier generation of war criminals effectively claimed their actions were \u201cwithin their scope of employment.\u201d That defense didn\u2019t work at Nuremberg for Germans, but it works now for U.S. officials in U.S. courts.\n\nThe closing the Office of Global Criminal Justice just makes official what has been U.S. policy since 9/11. If it is true that hypocrisy is the tribute that vice pays to virtue, then the U.S. government has showered tribute upon vice with the hypocrisy of the Office of Global Criminal Justice. If it closes, it means we won\u2019t even pay tribute anymore to virtue, preferring to fully embrace vice in a display of our \u201cauthenticity.\u201d And that may be the one example where the \u201cOffice of Global Criminal Justice\u201d fulfills its mission to \u201cexpose the truth.\u201d\n\n(Ret.)

Our forward-deployed force will be the first to the fight, ready to deliver a lethal response at a moment\u2019s notice if our nation calls.\u201d\n\nThe display of allied military power comes just days after North Korea launched three short-range ballistic missiles into the East Sea/Sea of Japan and fired an intermediate-range ballistic missile over Japan, raising alarms. North Korea called the second launch a \u201cmeaningful prelude to containing Guam,\u201d a reference to its early warnings of possible strikes around the Pacific territory.

North Korea actually cited the B-1B Lancer flights over the Peninsula as one of the reasons it plans to fire missiles around Guam in its own display of power. North Korea revealed earlier this month it is considering launching a salvo of four Hwasong-12 IRBMs into waters around Guam to send a message to President Donald Trump. (RELATED: North Korea Plans To Fire Multiple Missiles Into Waters Around Guam)\n\nThe Trump administration has been pursuing a policy of \u201cmaximum pressure and engagement,\u201d which involves using economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure to bring Pyongyang to the negotiating table for a diplomatic solution.

With a different theme each night, it purports to give a realistic look at Russia today. The image conveyed is of a Russia that is undemocratic with widespread state repression, violence and propaganda. Following are significant distortions and falsehoods in the five-part documentary.\n\nEpisode 1: \u201cHow Putin Redefined what it means to be Russian\u201d\n\nIn this episode, the documentary:\n\n\u2013Claims that Russian identity is based on \u201cprojection of power.\u201d In reality, \u201cprojection of power\u201d characterizes the U.S. much more than Russia. For the past two centuries the United States has expanded across the continent and globe. The last century is documented in the book Overthrow: American\u2019s Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq. The U.S. currently has nearly 800 foreign military bases in over 70 countries. In contrast, Russia has military bases in only two countries beyond the former Soviet Union: Syria and Vietnam.\n\n\u2013Ignores crucial information about events in Ukraine. Russian involvement in eastern Ukraine and Crimea are presented as examples of \u201cprojection of power.\u201d But basic facts are omitted from the documentary. There is no mention of the violent February 2014 coup in Kiev nor the involvement of neoconservatives such as Sen. John McCain and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland in supporting and encouraging the overthrow of Ukraine\u2019s elected government. In a December 2013 speech, Nuland outlined her intense involvement in Ukraine including U.S. insistence that Ukraine choose a \u201cEuropean future\u201d since the U.S. had \u201cinvested $5 billion to assist.\u201d Days before the coup in February 2014, Nuland was captured on audio planning the composition of the coup leadership.\n\n\u2013Ignores Crimea\u2019s historic connections with Russia and the Ukrainian violence. The documentary says, \u201cIn 2014 in Crimea, Russia helped install separatist leaders who rushed through a referendum that led to Crimea\u2019s annexation.\u201d This gives the misleading impression the decision was Russian, not Crimean.\n\nEven the New York Times report on March 16, 2014, acknowledged that, \u201cThe outcome, in a region that shares a language and centuries of history with Russia, was a foregone conclusion even before exit polls showed more than 93 percent of voters favoring secession.\u201d\n\nThe documentary fails to mention the fear of violence after Crimean travelers to Kiev were beaten and killed by Ukrainian hyper-nationalists. One of the first decisions of the Kiev coup government was to declare that Russian would no longer be an official language. A good overview including video interviews with Crimeans is in this video, contrasting sharply with the implications of the PBS documentary.\n\n\u2013Trivializes Russian opposition to NATO expansion. The documentary suggests Russians feel \u201chumiliated\u201d by NATO expanding to their borders. This distorts a serious military concern into a subjective, emotional issue. In 2002, the U.S. unilaterally withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and started construction of missile defense systems which could be used in tandem with a nuclear first strike. In recent years, NATO troops and missiles have been installed at Russia\u2019s borders. Imagine the response if Russian troops and missiles were placed at the U.S. border in Canada and Mexico.\n\n\u2013Falsely claims that coup violence in Odessa was \u201cexaggerated.\u201d\n\nThe documentary says that Russians who went to help defend civilians in eastern Ukraine were convinced by Russian \u201cpropaganda\u201d where \u201cdozens of pro-Russian separatists died in Odessa, Ukraine\u201d but \u201cRussian media exaggerated the attack.\u201d In reality, the Odessa attack killed at least 42 people and injured 100. This video shows the sequence of events with the initial attack on peaceful protesters followed by fire-bomb attacks in the building. Fire trucks were prevented from reaching the building to put out the fire and rescue citizens inside.\n\nEpisode 2: \u201cInside Russia\u2019s Propaganda Machine.\u201d\n\nIn this episode, the documentary:\n\n\u2013Suggests Russians are aggressive and threatening. The documentary highlights a Russian TV broadcaster who is translated to say, \u201cRussia is the only country in the world that is realistically capable of turning the United States into radioactive ash.\u201d And later, \u201cIf you can persuade a person, you don\u2019t need to kill him \u2026 if you aren\u2019t able to persuade, then you will have to kill.\u201d We do not know the context or accuracy of these translated statements. However on the basis of my own travels in Russia and the experience of many other Americans, these statements are strange and uncharacteristic.\n\nAt the popular and government level, Russians are typically at pains to call the U.S. a \u201cpartner\u201d and to wish for peace and better relations. With 27 million killed in World War 2, most Russians are very conscious of the consequences of war and deeply want peace. Russians vividly recall the Russia-U.S. alliance during WW2 and seek a return to friendly collaboration. The film producers must have heard this message and desire for peace expressed by many Russians many times. But the documentary only presents this uncharacteristic aggressive message.\n\n\u2013Inaccurately suggests that producers of a private TV network received angry public messages because they were exposing corruption. In reality, the angry public response was because the TV station ran a poll asking viewers if the Soviet Union should have surrendered to Nazi Germany to save lives during the siege of Leningrad.\n\n\u2013Falsely suggests that RT (Russia Today TV) typically features Holocaust deniers and neo-Nazis. This is a grotesque distortion Anyone who watches RT will know that American personalities such as Chris Hedges, Larry King and Ed Schultz are regulars on RT. Interviewees on international affairs generally come from the left side of the political spectrum \u2013 the opposite of what is suggested.\n\n\u2013Uncritically repeats the conspiracy theory that Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Hillary Clinton emails. The findings have been disputed by the publisher of the emails, Julian Assange of Wikileaks , as well as Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity. A recent forensic examination confirms that this was a leak not a hack (inside job done by local data transfer NOT a hack over the internet) and points to \u201cGuccifer 2.0\u201d, the presumptive \u201chacker,\u201d being a hoax intentionally created to implicate Russia.\n\n\u2013Falsely suggests that anti-Clinton social media messaging during 2016 was significantly caused by Russian government trolls. Hillary Clinton was strongly opposed by significant portions of both the left and right. There were probably hundreds of thousands of Americans who shared anti-Clinton social media messages.\n\n\u2013Claims that research showing a Google search engine bias in favor of Hillary Clinton was \u201cquickly debunked.\u201d The documentary ignores the original article describing the potential effect of search-engine bias, which was published in the prestigious Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The author is Dr. Robert Epstein, former editor-in-chief of Psychology Today magazine. Contradicting the claim that this research was \u201cdebunked,\u201d this academic article estimates the effect of the Google bias and how the bias went away AFTER the election. The response from Google and very shallow Snopes \u201dfact check\u201d are effectively rebutted by the lead author here. In neo-McCarthyist style, the documentary smears the findings and claims they were \u201claundered\u201d after being published by the Russian \u201cSputnik\u201d media.\n\n\u2013Suggests the \u201cidea that President Kennedy was killed by the CIA\u201d was \u201cplanted\u201d by the Soviet intelligence agency KGB. Many impressive American books have been written supporting this contention, from New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison\u2019s book to David Talbot\u2019s 2015 book Devil\u2019s Chessboard: Allen Dulles, the CIA and Deep State. Claiming that this accusation is based on KGB \u201cdisinformation\u201d is another grotesque distortion. It is not revealing disinformation; this is an example of disinformation.\n\nEpisode 3: \u201cWhy are so many from this Russian republic fighting for Isis?\u201d\n\nIn this episode, the documentary:\n\n\u2013Rationalizes and almost justifies Russian Muslims traveling to join ISIS. The documentary suggests that religious repression and discrimination is a cause of ISIS recruitment and that \u201cDagestanis who fought for ISIS continue a decades-old legacy here of radicalism and militancy.\u201d\n\n\u2013Ignores the role of the U.S., Saudi Arabia and Pakistan in promoting Islamist fundamentalism in Dagestan. As described by Robert Dreyfus in the book Devil\u2019s Game: How the United States Helped Unleash Fundamentalist Islam: \u201cthe Casey-ISI (CIA and Pakistan Secret Service) actions aided the growth of a significant network of right-wing, Islamist extremists who, to this day, plague the governments of the former Soviet republics \u2026 In particular, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, the Islamic Liberation Party, the powerful Islamist groups in Chechnya and Dagestan.\u201d\n\n\u2013Ignores the role of the US and allies in facilitating ISIS. As journalist Patrick Cockburn has written, \u201cIn the 20 years between 1996 and 2016, the CIA and British security and foreign policy agencies have consistently given priority to maintaining their partnership with powerful Sunni states over the elimination of terrorist organizations such as al-Qaeda and Isis.\u201d\n\nJournalist Nafeez Ahmed exposed the role of Turkey here, \u201cA former senior counter-terrorism official in Turkey has blown the whistle on President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s deliberate sponsorship of the Islamic State (ISIS) as a geopolitical tool to expand Turkey\u2019s regional influence and sideline his political opponents at home.\u201d\n\nElements of the U.S. military/intelligence suggested the establishment of ISIS to \u201cisolate the Syrian regime.\u201d This was revealed in the classified 2012 report of the Defense Intelligence Agency that \u201cTHERE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING A DECLARED OR UNDECLARED SALAFIST PRINCIPALITY IN EASTERN SYRIA (HASAKA AND DER ZOR), AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE SUPPORTING POWERS TO THE OPPOSITION WANT, IN ORDER TO ISOLATE THE SYRIAN REGIME\u201d\n\nIn short, ISIS recruitment from Muslim communities in Russia and worldwide has been spurred by the policies and actions of the U.S. and allies such as Saudi Arabia and Turkey. This is what Dreyfus calls The Devil\u2019s Game, but is ignored in the documentary.\n\nEpisode 4: \u201cThe Deadly Risk of Standing up to Putin\u201d\n\nIn this episode, the documentary:\n\n\u2013Suggests that critics of Putin and the Russian government face \u201cconsequences\u201d including death. These accusations are widespread in the West but largely based on the claims of different U.S.-supported \u201cactivists.\u201d One of the most famous cases, and the one on which U.S. congressional sanctions against Russia are based, is that of Sergei Magnitsky. Magnitsky\u2019s death was the subject of a documentary, which has been effectively banned in the U.S. In the course of researching what happened, the filmmaker learned that the truth was very different than has been told in the West and promoted by hedge-fund executive William Browder. Gilbert Doctorow outlines what happens in his review of the film here:\n\n\u201c\u2018Magnitsky Act: Behind the Scenes\u2019 is an amazing film which takes us through the thought processes, the evidence sorting of the well-known independent film maker Andrei Nekrasov as he approached an assignment that was at the outset meant to be one more public confirmation of the narrative Browder has sold to the US Congress and to the American and European political elites. That story was all about a 36 year old whistle-blower \u2018attorney\u2019 (actually a bookkeeper) named Sergei Magnitsky who denounced on Browder\u2019s behalf the theft of Russian taxes to his boss\u2019s companies amounting to $230 million and who was rewarded for his efforts by arrest, torture and murder in detainment by the officials who perpetrated the theft. This shocking tale drove legislation that was a major landmark in the descent of US-Russian relations under President Barack Obama to a level rivaling the worst days of the Cold War.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the film we understand that this story was concocted by William Browder to cover up his own criminal theft of the money in question, that Magnitsky was not a whistleblower, but on the contrary was likely an assistant and abettor to the fraud and theft that Browder organized, that he was not murdered by corrupt Russian police but died in prison from banal neglect of his medical condition.\u201d\n\nThe PBS documentary quotes an opposition leader, Vladimir Kara-Murza, saying \u201cWe have no free and fair elections. We have censorship in the media. We have political prisoners, more than 100 political prisoners now in Russia, today.\u201d Kara-Murza now lives in Washington \u201cfor his safety\u201d but returns to Russia periodically. He claims to have been poisoned several times.\n\nOpponents of the Russian government are quick to accuse but the evidence is largely hearsay and speculation. Public polls of citizens in Russia repeatedly indicate that Putin and the government have widespread popularity, in contrast with the accusations in this documentary that they rule by intimidation and violence.\n\nEpisode 5: \u201cWhat Russians think about Trump and the U.S.\u201d\n\nBased on the content, the final episode should be titled \u201cWhat the U.S. establishment and media thinks of Putin and Russia.\u201d In this episode, the documentary:\n\n\u2013Features accusations by CIA Director Mike Pompeo that Russian President Putin, \u201c is a man for whom veracity doesn\u2019t translate into English.\u201d An objective documentary would take CIA claims about \u201cveracity\u201d with a healthy dose of skepticism. Just a few years ago, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper was confirmed to have lied under oath to Congress. Former CIA chief of counterintelligence James Angleton said in his dying days, \u201cFundamentally, the founding fathers of U.S. intelligence were liars. The better you lied and the more you betrayed, the more likely you got promoted.\u201d So it is curious to see the PBS documentary uncritically presenting the new CIA director as a judge of veracity.\n\n\u2013Implies that President Trump is out of line to question \u201cthe U.S. intelligence community\u2019s unanimous assessment that Russia hacked the 2016 election.\u201d It has been recently exposed that the \u201cunanimous assessment\u201d was, in reality, by \u201chand-picked\u201d analysts at three agencies, under DNI Clapper\u2019s oversight, not all 17 agencies and that the National Security Agency did NOT have \u201chigh confidence\u201d in a key finding. The \u201cassessment,\u201d which the Jan. 6 report acknowledged was NOT an establishment of fact, was based on the forensics of a private company, Crowdstrike, with a checkered record in this field, and the dubious Christopher Steele dossier, a collection of \u201copposition research\u201d reports against Donald Trump, paid for unidentified allies of Hillary Clinton and compiled by Steele, an ex-British intelligence agent.\n\nIn March 2017, Crowdstrike was found to have made false claims in another investigation of an alleged Russian \u201chack.\u201d Yet, neither the CIA nor FBI examined the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computers. If the issue was as important as it supposedly has now become, the FBI should have issued a subpoena to do its own examination. Why the DNC rejected the FBI request, and why the FBI did not insist, raises serious questions given the enormous publicity and accusations that have followed.\n\n\u2013Uncritically features two US politicians making loose accusations and effectively criminalizing \u201ccontacts\u201d with Russians. Sen. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, says President Trump is \u201cpushing out some messages that are consistent with the Kremlin policies \u2026 there\u2019s no question that the Russians were trying to hack into our elections.\u201d Yet, former U.S. intelligence officers with experience in these areas recently presented evidence raising significant questions about this conventional wisdom.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia indicates the Senate investigation reached its conclusion before it began. He said, \u201cThe goal of this investigation is not only to reconfirm Russian intervention and explain that to the American public, but to also see if there were any contacts between Trump and the Russians.\u201d\n\nIn the current environment, to have \u201ccontacts\u201d with Russians has been criminalized. Instead of questioning the validity or wisdom of this position, the documentary presents it with seeming approval.\n\n\u2013Uncritically promotes false statements and reckless threats. Sen. Lankford says \u201cWe believe strongly that what Russia continues to do to be able to threaten Ukraine, threaten its neighbors, threaten NATO, to continue to pry into not only our elections, but other elections, is destabilizing, and it demands a response. They have yet to have a consequence to what they did in the election time. And they should.\u201d\n\nLankford\u2019s assertions are presented as facts but are debatable or false. For example, security services in Germany, France and the U.K. all found that \u2013 despite the international accusations \u2013 there was NO evidence of Russian interference in their recent elections.\n\n\u2013Justifies and promotes \u201cpunishment\u201d of Russia. The belligerent approach of Lankford and Warner is continued by PBS host Judy Woodruff and narrator Nick Schifrin. The U.S. is portrayed as a vulnerable victim with a future that is \u201cforeboding\u201d. Russia is portrayed as threatening and needing some punishment soon: \u201cThe Russian government doesn\u2019t feel like the United States government really penalized them for what happened last year\u2026. a lot of officials here in Washington agree with that\u2026 Russia should have paid for what they did last year.\u201d\n\nThis threatening talk is then followed by the following assessment from the narrator: \u201cThere are analysts in Moscow who think the only thing we can hope is that we avoid war.\u201d\n\nIn 2002-2003, American mainstream media failed to question or challenge the assertions of the CIA and politicians pushing for the invasion of Iraq. At that time, the false pretense was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and posed a threat to the U.S.\n\nMuch of the media and many of the same politicians are now claiming Russia is an adversary that has \u201cattacked us.\u201d This claim is being widely made without serious question or challenge. \u201cLiberal\u201d media seems to be in alliance with hawkish neoconservatives on this issue. Virtually any accusation against Russia and its leader can be made with impunity and without serious evidence.\n\nThe PBS documentary \u201cInside Putin\u2019s Russia\u201d aims to expose Russian repression, aggression and disinformation. As shown in the many examples above, the five-part documentary is highly biased and inaccurate. While it shows some features of Russia, it also demonstrates American propaganda in the current tumultuous times.\n\nRick Sterling is an investigative journalist based in northern California.

Seven months after the commission\u2019s first meeting \u2014 and nine months after Hillary Clinton backer Tom Perez won a close election over Bernie Sanders supporter Keith Ellison to become chair of the Democratic National Committee \u2014 the battle lines are coming into focus for next year.\n\nThe commission\u2019s final meeting adjourned on Saturday after a few steps toward democratizing the party had won approval \u2014 due to the grassroots strength of progressives. But the recommendations from the commission will go to the Rules and Bylaws Committee, which was one of the DNC decision-making bodies that Perez subjected to a purge two months ago. Now, in the words of Jim Zogby (who was removed from the Executive Committee by Perez), \u201cThere are virtually no Bernie supporters on the Rules and Bylaws Committee.\u201d\n\nWhen the latest Unity Reform Commission meeting got underway, Perez talked a lot about unity. But kicking Sanders supporters off of key DNC committees is the ugly underside of an ongoing dual discourse. (Are we supposed to believe Perez\u2019s soothing words or our own eyes?) And party unity behind a failed approach \u2014 internally undemocratic and politically hitched to corporate wagons \u2014 would hardly be auspicious.\n\n\u201cEmerging sectors of the electorate are compelling the Democratic Party to come to terms with adamant grassroots rejection of economic injustice, institutionalized racism, gender inequality, environmental destruction and corporate domination,\u201d says the recent report \u201cAutopsy: The Democratic Party in Crisis\u201d (which I co-authored). The report adds: \u201cSiding with the people who constitute the base isn\u2019t truly possible when party leaders seem to be afraid of them.\u201d\n\nDNC Chairman Perez and allied power brokers keep showing that they\u2019re afraid of the party\u2019s progressive base. No amount of appealing rhetoric changes that reality.\n\n\u201cWe pride ourselves on being inclusive and welcoming to all,\u201d the Democratic National Committee proclaimed anew at the start of this month, touting the commission meeting as \u201copen to the public.\u201d Yet the DNC delayed and obscured information about the meeting, never replying to those who filled out an online RSVP form \u2014 thus leaving them in the dark about the times of the meeting. In short, the DNC went out of its way to suppress public turnout rather than facilitate it.\n\nRebuking the DNC\n\nOne member of the task force that wrote the Autopsy, Karen Bernal, is the chair of the Progressive Caucus of the California Democratic Party. After traveling across the country and sitting in the sparse audience during the first day of the Unity Reform Commission meeting, she took the liberty of speaking up as the second day got underway. Bernal provided a firm rebuke of the DNC\u2019s efforts to suppress public attendance.\n\n\u201cFor all of the talk about wanting to improve and reform and make this party more transparent, the exact opposite has happened,\u201d Bernal told the commission. (Her intervention, which lasted a little more than two minutes, aired in full on C-SPAN.)\n\nOn Sunday, a mass email from Zogby via Our Revolution summed up: \u201cWe are fighting for racial, social, economic, and environmental justice. The Democratic Party needs everyone, regardless of their race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, ability, country of origin, language, or socioeconomic status, to be deeply involved in order to change the course of this country.\u201d\n\nFor those reasons, he added, \u201cwe are calling for an end to superdelegates, [for] open primaries and caucuses, [for] same-day registration, and [for] more transparent, fair, and accountable leadership at the helm of the DNC.\u201d\n\nOverall, the commission approved some recommendations that were partial victories for progressives. Among the most notable: It called for reducing the number of notoriously undemocratic superdelegates to the national convention from 712 to about 300, while the only democratic number would be zero. [Superdelegates are party insiders who are not chosen through a primary or caucus but nevertheless get to vote for the party\u2019s nominees. In 2016, they broke overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton.]\n\nThe commission somewhat improved transparency for often-dubious DNC contracts with high-paid consultants and vendors, while defeating sensible amendments by commission member Nomiki Konst \u2014 who spoke with notable clarity about the need to clamp down on financial conflicts of interest among DNC decision-makers.\n\nThe eight Sanders appointees \u2014 Konst, Zogby, Larry Cohen, Lucy Flores, Jane Kleeb, Gus Newport, Nina Turner and Jeff Weaver \u2014 put up a good fight as members of the Unity Reform Commission. They were outnumbered, and on key issues were often outvoted, by the 13 who\u2019d been selected by Clinton or Perez. Next year, the odds to overcome will be much worse.\n\nWith the purged Rules and Bylaws Committee now overwhelmingly stacked against progressives, only massive pressure from the grassroots will be able to sustain momentum toward a democratic Democratic Party. Meanwhile, corporate forces will do all they can to prevent the Democratic Party from living up to its first name.\n\nNorman Solomon, the national coordinator of the online activist group RootsAction.org, is a member of the task force that wrote \u201cAutopsy: The Democratic Party in Crisis.\u201d His books include War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death.", "domain": "consortiumnews.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://consortiumnews.com/2017/12/11/national-democrats-resist-reforms/"}

In that zone of denial, U.S. news media keep detouring around a crucial reality: No matter what you think of Donald Trump or Vladimir Putin, they hold the whole world in their hands with a nuclear button.\n\nIf the presidents of the United States and Russia spiral into escalating conflicts between the two countries, the world is much more likely to blow up. Yet many American critics of Trump have gotten into baiting him as Putin\u2019s flunky while goading him to prove otherwise. A new barrage of that baiting and goading is now about to begin \u2014 taking aim at any wisps of possible d\u00e9tente \u2014 in connection with the announced meeting between Trump and Putin at the G-20 summit in Germany at the end of this week.\n\nBig picture: This moment in human history is not about Trump. It\u2019s not about Putin. It\u2019s not about whether you despise either or neither or both. What\u2019s at stake in the dynamics between them is life on this planet.\n\nOver the weekend, more than 10,000 people signed a petition under the heading \u201cTell Trump and Putin: Negotiate, Don\u2019t Escalate.\u201d The petition was written by RootsAction to be concise and to the point: \u201cWe vehemently urge you to take a constructive approach to your planned meeting at the G-20 summit. Whatever our differences, we must reduce rather than increase the risks of nuclear war. The future of humanity is at stake.\u201d\n\nA war between the world\u2019s two nuclear superpowers could extinguish human life on a gigantic scale while plunging the Earth into cataclysmic \u201cnuclear winter.\u201d\n\n\u201cRecent scientific studies have found that a war fought with the deployed U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals would leave Earth virtually uninhabitable,\u201d wrote Steven Starr, a senior scientist with Physicians for Social Responsibility. \u201cIn fact, NASA computer models have shown that even a \u2018successful\u2019 first strike by Washington or Moscow would inflict catastrophic environmental damage that would make agriculture impossible and cause mass starvation.\u201d\n\nThe Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists explains why, since last year, it has moved the risk-estimate \u201cDoomsday Clock\u201d even closer to apocalyptic midnight \u2014 citing as a major factor the escalation of tensions between the U.S. and Russian governments.\n\nSo, the imminent meeting between Trump and Putin will affect the chances that the young people we love \u2014 and so many others around the world \u2014 will have a future. And whether later generations will even exist.\n\nI put it this way in a recent article for The Nation: \u201cWhatever the truth may be about Russian interference in the U.S. election last year, an overarching truth continues to bind the fates of Russians, Americans and the rest of humanity. No matter how much we might wish to forget or deny it, we are tied together by a fraying thread of relations between two nations that possess 93 percent of the world\u2019s nuclear weapons. Right now it is not popular to say so, but we desperately need each other to enhance the odds of human survival.\u201d\n\nIn that overall context, stoking hostility toward Russia is, uh, rather short-sighted. Wouldn\u2019t it be much better for the meeting between Trump and Putin to bring Washington and Moscow closer to d\u00e9tente rather than bringing us closer to nuclear annihilation?\n\nNorman Solomon is the coordinator of the online activist group RootsAction.org and the executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy.

If not for Haiti, the course of U.S. history could have been very different, with the United States possibly never expanding much beyond the Appalachian Mountains.\n\nIn the 1700s, then-called St. Domingue and covering the western third of the island of Hispaniola, Haiti was a French colony that rivaled the American colonies as the most valuable European possession in the Western Hemisphere. Relying on a ruthless exploitation of African slaves, French plantations there produced nearly one-half the world\u2019s coffee and sugar.\n\nMany of the great cities of France owe their grandeur to the wealth that was extracted from Haiti and its slaves. But the human price was unspeakably high. The French had devised a fiendishly cruel slave system that imported enslaved Africans for work in the fields with accounting procedures for their amortization. They were literally worked to death.\n\nThe American colonists may have rebelled against Great Britain over issues such as representation in Parliament and arbitrary actions by King George III. But black Haitians confronted a brutal system of slavery. An infamous French method of executing a troublesome slave was to insert a gunpowder charge into his rectum and then detonate the explosive.\n\nSo, as the American colonies fought for their freedom in the 1770s and as that inspiration against tyranny spread to France in the 1780s, the repercussions would eventually reach Haiti, where the Jacobins\u2019 cry of \u201cliberty, equality and fraternity\u201d resonated with special force. Slaves demanded that the concepts of freedom be applied universally.\n\nWhen the brutal French plantation system continued, violent slave uprisings followed. Hundreds of white plantation owners were slain as the rebels overran the colony. A self-educated slave named Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture emerged as the revolution\u2019s leader, demonstrating skills on the battlefield and in the complexities of politics.\n\nDespite the atrocities committed by both sides of the conflict, the rebels known as the \u201cBlack Jacobins\u201d gained the sympathy of the American Federalist Party and particularly Alexander Hamilton, a native of the Caribbean himself and a fierce opponent of slavery. Hamilton, the first U.S. Treasury Secretary, helped L\u2019Ouverture draft a constitution for the new nation.\n\nConspiracies\n\nBut events in Paris and Washington soon conspired to undo the promise of Haiti\u2019s new freedom. Despite Hamilton\u2019s sympathies, some Founders, including Thomas Jefferson who owned 180 slaves and owed his political strength to agrarian interests, looked nervously at the slave rebellion in St. Domingue. Jefferson feared that slave uprisings might spread northward.\n\n\u201cIf something is not done, and soon done,\u201d Jefferson wrote in 1797, \u201cwe shall be the murderers of our own children.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, across the Atlantic, the chaos and excesses of the French Revolution led to the ascendance of Napoleon Bonaparte, a brilliant and vain military commander possessed of legendary ambition. As he expanded his power across Europe, Napoleon also dreamed of rebuilding a French empire in the Americas.\n\nIn 1801, Jefferson became the third President of the United States and his interests at least temporarily aligned with those of Napoleon. The French dictator was determined to restore French control of St. Domingue and Jefferson was eager to see the slave rebellion crushed.\n\nThrough secret diplomatic channels, Napoleon asked Jefferson if the United States would help a French army traveling by sea to St. Domingue. Jefferson replied that \u201cnothing will be easier than to furnish your army and fleet with everything and reduce Toussaint [L\u2019Ouverture] to starvation.\u201d\n\nBut Napoleon had a secret second phase of his plan that he didn\u2019t share with Jefferson. Once the French army had subdued L\u2019Ouverture and his rebel force, Napoleon intended to advance to the North American mainland, basing a new French empire in New Orleans and settling the vast territory west of the Mississippi River.\n\nIn May 1801, Jefferson picked up the first inklings of Napoleon\u2019s other agenda. Alarmed at the prospect of a major European power controlling New Orleans and thus the mouth of the strategic Mississippi River, Jefferson backpedaled on his commitment to Napoleon, retreating to a posture of neutrality. Still terrified at the prospect of a successful republic organized by freed African slaves Jefferson took no action to block Napoleon\u2019s thrust into the New World.\n\nIn 1802, a French expeditionary force achieved initial success against the slave army, driving L\u2019Ouverture\u2019s forces back into the mountains. But, as they retreated, the ex-slaves torched the cities and the plantations, destroying the colony\u2019s once-thriving economic infrastructure.\n\nL\u2019Ouverture, hoping to bring the war to an end, accepted Napoleon\u2019s promise of a negotiated settlement that would ban future slavery in the country. As part of the agreement, L\u2019Ouverture turned himself in. Napoleon, however, broke his word.\n\nJealous of L\u2019Ouverture, who was regarded by some admirers as a general with skills rivaling Napoleon\u2019s, the French dictator had L\u2019Ouverture shipped in chains back to Europe where he was mistreated and died in prison.\n\nFoiled Plans\n\nInfuriated by the betrayal, L\u2019Ouverture\u2019s young generals resumed the war with a vengeance. In the months that followed, the French army already decimated by disease was overwhelmed by a fierce enemy fighting in familiar terrain and determined not to be put back into slavery.\n\nNapoleon sent a second French army, but it too was destroyed. Though the famed general had conquered much of Europe, he lost 24,000 men, including some of his best troops, in St. Domingue before abandoning his campaign. The death toll among the ex-slaves was much higher, but they had prevailed, albeit over a devastated land.\n\nBy 1803, a frustrated Napoleon denied his foothold in the New World agreed to sell New Orleans and the Louisiana territories to Jefferson. Ironically, the Louisiana Purchase, which opened the heart of the present United States to American settlement, had been made possible despite Jefferson\u2019s misguided collaboration with Napoleon.\n\nJefferson also saw the new territory as an opportunity to expand slavery in the United States, creating a lucrative new industry of slave-breeding that would financially benefit Jefferson and his plantation-owning neighbors. But nothing would be done to help Haiti. [See Consortiumnews.com\u2019s \u201cThomas Jefferson: America\u2019s Founding Sociopath.\u201d]\n\n\u201cBy their long and bitter struggle for independence, St. Domingue\u2019s blacks were instrumental in allowing the United States to more than double the size of its territory,\u201d wrote Stanford University professor John Chester Miller in his book, The Wolf by the Ears: Thomas Jefferson and Slavery.\n\nBut, Miller observed, \u201cthe decisive contribution made by the black freedom fighters went almost unnoticed by the Jeffersonian administration.\u201d\n\nThe loss of L\u2019Ouverture\u2019s leadership dealt a severe blow to Haiti\u2019s prospects, according to Jefferson scholar Paul Finkelman of Virginia Polytechnic Institute.\n\n\u201cHad Toussaint lived, it\u2019s very likely that he would have remained in power long enough to put the nation on a firm footing, to establish an order of succession,\u201d Finkelman told me in an interview. \u201cThe entire subsequent history of Haiti might have been different.\u201d\n\nInstead, the island nation continued a downward spiral. In 1804, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, the radical slave leader who had replaced L\u2019Ouverture, formally declared the nation\u2019s independence and returned it to its original Indian name, Haiti. A year later, apparently fearing a return of the French and a counterrevolution, Dessalines ordered the massacre of the remaining French whites on the island.\n\nThough the Haitian resistance had blunted Napoleon\u2019s planned penetration of the North American mainland, Jefferson reacted to the shocking bloodshed in Haiti by imposing a stiff economic embargo on the island nation. In 1806, Dessalines himself was brutally assassinated, touching off a cycle of political violence that would haunt Haiti for the next two centuries.\n\nJefferson\u2019s Blemish\n\nFor some scholars, Jefferson\u2019s vengeful policy toward Haiti like his personal ownership of slaves represented an ugly blemish on his legacy as a historic advocate of freedom. Even in his final years, Jefferson remained obsessed with Haiti and its link to the issue of American slavery.\n\nIn the 1820s, the former President proposed a scheme for taking away the children born to black slaves in the United States and shipping them to Haiti. In that way, Jefferson posited that both slavery and America\u2019s black population could be phased out. Eventually, in Jefferson\u2019s view, Haiti would be all black and the United States white.\n\nJefferson\u2019s deportation scheme never was taken very seriously and American slavery would continue for another four decades until it was ended by the Civil War. The official hostility of the United States toward Haiti extended almost as long, ending in 1862 when President Abraham Lincoln finally granted diplomatic recognition.\n\nBy then, however, Haiti\u2019s destructive patterns of political violence and economic chaos had been long established continuing up to the present time. Personal and political connections between Haiti\u2019s light-skinned elite and power centers of Washington also have lasted through today.\n\nRecent Republican administrations have been particularly hostile to the popular will of the impoverished Haitian masses. When leftist priest Jean-Bertrand Aristide was twice elected by overwhelming margins, he was ousted both times first during the presidency of George H.W. Bush and again under President George W. Bush.\n\nWashington\u2019s conventional wisdom on Haiti holds that the country is a hopeless basket case that would best be governed by business-oriented technocrats who would take their marching orders from the United States.\n\nHowever, the Haitian people have a different perspective. Unlike most Americans who have no idea about their historic debt to Haiti, many Haitians know this history quite well. The bitter memories of Jefferson and Napoleon still feed the distrust that Haitians of all classes feel toward the outside world.\n\n\u201cIn Haiti, we became the first black independent country,\u201d Aristide once told me in an interview. \u201cWe understand, as we still understand, it wasn\u2019t easy for them American, French and others to accept our independence.\u201d\n\nInvestigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s.

Blockchain Stocks Are Next!\n\nDriving downtown yesterday. Mrs S and I were idly chattering about this and that when she dropped the bombshell that Farcebook have been asking users to send their nude pictures to Farcebook so that they can \u2018Police\u2019 the images off their platform. Which statement drew an bark of laughter from me. Apparently they want to get rid of \u2018revenge porn\u2019. \u201cAre these people serious?\u201d I enquired after my initial \u2018WTF\u2019.\n\n\u201cOh yes.\u201d She chuckled back at me.\n\n\u201cOh my giddy aunt.\u201d I responded. \u201cThat\u2019s going to work, isn\u2019t it?\u201d We shared another laugh.\n\n\u201cGlad I don\u2019t use it any more.\u201d She said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried to delete mine twice and it still comes back. Bloody thing. Worse than Zombies.\u201d I replied.\n\n\u201cEldest and Youngest use Whatsapp and Instagram anyway. So they\u2019re not affected by this idiocy.\u201d She said. The last Facebook post we saw from either of them was back when we lived in Nanaimo. And that was over four years ago. Even back in 2011 our family regarded Facebook as somewhat pass\u00e9.\n\nAccording to reports a pilot of this scheme is being rolled out in Australia. A \u2018send us your nude pics just in case an ex has posted them. We\u2019ll delete them -honestly.\u2019 Then Facebook members of staff get to have their brains fried by overdosing on personal porn or perve off on the quiet because they\u2019ve had \u2018special training\u2019 to view the stuff that the algorithms are supposed to dredge up. However, a much more studied perspective exposes the flaws in this plan. Which would tempt anyone with more than two functioning brain cells to express a big Oh. My God.\n\nThis is yet another Farcebook PR disaster. Which leaves me soo tempted to short their shares. From where I stand they\u2019re a classic financial bubble in the making because real people are actually leaving the platform, which will ultimately leave it as a half forgotten digital wasteland strewn with diehard digital addicts and \u2018bots. What\u2019s that Sooty? Won\u2019t happen? Remember Myspace.com? Oh. Right.\n\nAs for posting \u2018revenge porn\u2019, I mean seriously? There are even dedicated platforms for that sort of thing. You are more likely to find \u2018revenge porn\u2019 posted to Tinder (Which has Spotify and Facebook integration) or Tumblr. I\u2019d argue that only the most Interweb-naive people will use Farcebook for posting any form of porn because it hurts both parties. Why? Because once your bedroom antics are public, there\u2019s no going back. Your, and by the same token their inadequacies, are now subject to public ridicule and multiple reposting. Anything short of physical perfection will rebound on both parties. As a matter of interest, a quick pootle around many dedicated porn sites (The things we must do, eh?) will turn up Facebook and Twitter integration buttons. As well as huge archives of amateur porn pics and pictures. Which aren\u2019t on Farcebook, so Farcebook can\u2019t delete them.\n\nAnyway. That discussion concluded, we turned right from Blanshard into View Street, noting that all the fancy painted pedestrian crossings at that intersection had been dug up after less than a year. No doubt more taxpayer dollars will be wasted there and on Victoria\u2019s network of seldom-used bicycle lanes. Not that a lot of bicycle users know how to use them properly. Or that the fancy painting does anything to improve pedestrian safety or driver awareness.\n\nHey-ho. No skin off my nose. We don\u2019t need to go downtown more than twice a month anyway. Like with Facebook, there\u2019s not much of interest to us down there.\n\nSource: https://billsticker.wordpress.com/2017/11/12/farcebook-rides-again/", "domain": "beforeitsnews.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://beforeitsnews.com/eu/2017/11/farcebook-rides-again-2632411.html"}

Joe McCarthy\u2019s Cold War pursuit of \u201ccommunists\u201d who supposedly had infiltrated the U.S. government, the film industry and other American institutions on behalf of an international communist conspiracy.\n\nOperating parallel to McCarthy\u2019s Red Scare hearings was the House Un-American Activities Committee (or HUAC), a standing congressional panel from 1945-1975 when it was best known for investigating alleged communist subversion and propaganda. One of its top achievements was the blacklisting of the \u201cHollywood Ten\u201d whose careers in the movie industry were damaged or destroyed.\n\nAlthough the Cold War has long been over \u2013 and Russia has often cooperated with the U.S. government, especially on national security issues such as supplying U.S. troops in Afghanistan \u2013 Democrats and liberals seem ready to force Americans to again prove their loyalty if they engaged in conversations with Russians.\n\nOr perhaps these \u201cwitnesses\u201d can be entrapped into perjury charges if their recollections of conversations with Russians don\u2019t match up with transcripts of their intercepted communications, a tactic similar to ones used by Sen. McCarthy and HUAC to trip up and imprison targets over such secondary charges.\n\nOusted National Security Advisor Michael Flynn has already encountered such a predicament because he couldn\u2019t recall all the details of a phone conversation with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak on Dec. 29, 2016, after Flynn took the call while vacationing in the Dominican Republic.\n\nWhen Obama administration holdovers at the Justice Department decided to gin up a legal premise to go after Flynn, they cited the Logan Act, a law enacted in 1799 to prohibit private citizens from negotiating with foreign adversaries but never used to convict anyone. The law also is of dubious constitutionality and was surely never intended to apply to a president-elect\u2019s advisers.\n\nHowever, based on that flimsy pretext, FBI agents \u2013 with a transcript of the electronic intercept of the Kislyak-Flynn phone call in hand \u2013 tested Flynn\u2019s memory of the conversation and found his recollections incomplete. Gotcha \u2013 lying to the FBI!\n\nUnder mounting media and political pressure, President Trump fired Flynn, apparently hoping that tossing Flynn overboard to the circling sharks would somehow calm the sharks down. Instead, blood in the water added to the frenzy.\n\nIran-Contra Comparison\n\nSome prominent Democrats and liberals have compared Trump-connected contacts with Russians to President Richard Nixon\u2019s Watergate scandal or President Reagan\u2019s Iran-Contra Affair, an issue that I know a great deal about having helped expose it as a reporter for The Associated Press in the 1980s.\n\nThe key difference is that Iran-Contra was an unconstitutional effort by the Reagan administration to finance an illegal war against Nicaragua\u2019s Sandinista government in defiance of a congressional ban. The Trump-connected communications with Russians \u2013 to the degree they have occurred \u2013 appear to have been aimed at preventing a new and dangerous Cold War that could lead to a nuclear holocaust.\n\nIn other words, Iran-Contra was about enabling a paramilitary force to continue its brutal marauding inside a country that was no threat to the United States while the current \u201cscandal\u201d is about people trying to avoid hostilities between two nuclear superpowers, an existential threat that many mainstream and liberal pundits don\u2019t want to recognize.\n\nIndeed, there is a troubling denial-ism about the risks of an accidental or intentional war with Russia as the U.S. media and much of Official Washington\u2019s establishment have lots of fun demonizing Russian President Vladimir Putin and jabbing the Russians by shoving NATO troops up to their borders and deploying anti-ballistic missiles in Eastern Europe. For some crazy reason, the Russians feel threatened.\n\nFalse Narratives\n\nThis Russia-bashing and Russia-baiting have been accompanied by false narratives presented in the major U.S. newspapers, including The New York Times and The Washington Post, to justify increased tensions.\n\nFor instance, the Post\u2019s senior foreign affairs writer Karen DeYoung on Friday described the civil war in Ukraine this way: \u201cThat conflict began when Russia invaded and annexed Crimea in 2014, then backed separatists in eastern Ukraine in what has become a grinding war, despite a deal to end it, called the Minsk agreement, negotiated with Putin by the leaders of France and Germany.\u201d\n\nBut DeYoung\u2019s synopsis is simply not true. The crisis began in the fall of 2013 when Ukraine\u2019s elected President Viktor Yanukovych backed out of what he regarded as a costly and unacceptable association agreement with the European Union, a move which prompted protests by Ukrainians in Kiev\u2019s Maidan square.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s State Department, U.S. neocon politicians such as Sen. John McCain, and various U.S.-backed \u201cnon-governmental organizations\u201d then stoked those protests against Yanukovych, which grew violent as trained ultra-nationalist and neo-Nazi street fighters poured in from western Ukraine.\n\nIn early 2014, a coup to overthrow the democratically elected Yanukovych took shape under the guidance of U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt who were caught in a phone call in late January or early February 2014 conspiring to impose new leadership inside Ukraine.\n\nNuland disparaged a less extreme strategy favored by European diplomats with the pithy remark: \u201cFuck the E.U.\u201d and went on to declare \u201cYats is the guy,\u201d favoring Arseniy Yatsenyuk as the new leader. Nuland then pondered how to \u201cglue this thing\u201d while Pyatt ruminated about how to \u201cmidwife this thing.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 20, 2014, a mysterious sniper apparently firing from a building controlled by the ultranationalist Right Sektor killed both police and protesters, setting off a day of violence that left about 70 people dead including more than a dozen police.\n\nThe next day, three European governments struck a deal with Yanukovych in which he agreed to early elections and accepted reduced powers. But that political settlement wasn\u2019t enough for the U.S.-backed militants who stormed government buildings on Feb. 22, forcing Yanukovych and his officials to flee for their lives.\n\nInstead of standing by the Feb. 21 agreement, which the European nations had \u201cguaranteed,\u201d Nuland pushed for and got U.S. allies to accept the new post-coup regime as \u201clegitimate,\u201d with Yatsenyuk becoming prime minister and several top government posts given to the ultranationalists and neo-Nazis.\n\nSpreading Violence\n\nIn the ensuing days, the right-wing violence spread beyond Kiev, prompting Crimea\u2019s legislature to propose secession from Ukraine and readmission to Russia, whose relationship to the peninsula dated back to Catherine the Great.\n\nCrimea scheduled a referendum that was opposed by the new regime in Kiev. Russian troops did not \u201cinvade\u201d Crimea because some 20,000 were already stationed there as part of a basing agreement at the Black Sea port of Sevastopol. The Russians did provide security for the referendum but there was no evidence of intimidation as the citizens of Crimea voted by 96 percent to leave Ukraine and rejoin Russia, a move that Putin and the Russian duma accepted.\n\nEastern Ukrainians tried to follow Crimea\u2019s lead with their own referendum, but Putin and Russia rejected their appeals to secede. However, when the Kiev regime launched an \u201cAnti-Terrorism Operation\u201d against the so-called Donbass region \u2013 spearheaded by ultra-nationalist and neo-Nazi militias \u2013 Russia provided military assistance so these ethnic Russians would not be annihilated.\n\nKaren DeYoung also framed the Minsk agreement as if it were imposed on Putin when he was one of its principal proponents and architects, winning its approval in early 2015 at a time when the Ukrainian military was facing battlefield reversals.\n\nBut Assistant Secretary Nuland, working with Prime Minister Yatsenyuk and the Ukrainian parliament, sabotaged the agreement by requiring the Donbass rebels to first surrender which they were unwilling to do, having no faith in the sincerity of the Kiev regime to live up to its commitment to grant limited autonomy to the Donbass.\n\nIn other words, Kiev inserted a poison pill to prevent a peaceful resolution, but the Western media and governments always blame the Minsk failure on Putin.\n\nIf Karen DeYoung wanted to boil all this history down to one paragraph, it might go: \u201cThe Ukraine conflict began when U.S. officials supported the violent overthrow of elected President Viktor Yanukovych, prompting Crimea to rejoin Russia and causing ethnic Russians in the east to rise up against the U.S.-backed coup regime in Kiev, which then sought to crush the rebellion. The Kiev regime later torpedoed a peace deal that had been hammered out by Russian, Ukrainian and European negotiators in Minsk.\u201d\n\nBut such a summary would not have the desired propaganda effect on the American people. It would not present the U.S.-backed side as the \u201cwhite hats\u201d and the pro-Russia side as the \u201cblack hats.\u201d\n\nThe simple truth is that the story of Ukraine is far more complex and multi-sided than The Washington Post, The New York Times and most mainstream U.S. news outlets want to admit. They simply start the clock at the point of Crimea\u2019s rejection of the post-coup regime and distort those facts to present the situation simply as a \u201cRussian invasion.\u201d\n\nA Whipped-Up Hysteria\n\nThe major media\u2019s distortion is so egregious that you could call it a lie, but it is a lie that has proved very useful in whipping up the current anti-Russian hysteria that is sweeping Official Washington and that has given birth to a New Cold War, now accompanied by a New McCarthyism that deems anyone who doesn\u2019t accept the \u201cgroupthink\u201d a \u201cRussian apologist\u201d or a \u201cMoscow stooge.\u201d\n\nSince last November\u2019s election, this New McCarthyism has merged with hatred toward Donald Trump, especially after the outgoing Obama administration lodged unproven accusations that Russia undercut Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign by hacking into the emails of the Democratic National Committee and those of her campaign chairman John Podesta \u2013 and slipped that information to WikiLeaks.\n\nThose emails showed how the DNC undercut the rival campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders and revealed the contents of Clinton\u2019s speeches to Wall Street banks as well as pay-to-play aspects of the Clinton Foundation, information that Clinton wanted to keep from the voters.\n\nBut no one thought the emails were a major factor in the Clinton-Trump race; indeed, Clinton blamed her stunning defeat on FBI Director James Comey\u2019s last-minute decision to reopen and then re-close his investigation into security concerns about her use of a private email server as Secretary of State.\n\nBut the script on how Clinton lost was flipped during the Trump transition as President Obama\u2019s intelligence agencies floated the Russia-hacked-the-election scenario although presenting no public evidence to support the claims. WikiLeaks representatives also denied getting the material from Russia, suggesting instead that it was leaked by two different American insiders.\n\nA Ministry of Truth\n\nStill, during the post-election period, the anti-Russian hysteria continued to build. In November, The Washington Post highlighted claims by an anonymous group called PropOrNot accusing some 200 Web sites, including Consortiumnews.com and other major independent media outlets, of disseminating Russian \u201cpropaganda.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times joined in the frenzy by calling for leading technology companies to marginalize Web sites that are deemed to be publishing \u201cfake news,\u201d a vague term that was applied not just to intentionally false stories but to information that questioned official narratives, no matter how dubious those narratives were. The New McCarthyism was morphing into a New Orwellianism.\n\nThe movement toward a Ministry of Truth gained further momentum in December when Congress passed and President Obama signed a military authorization bill that included a new $160 million bureaucracy to identify and counter alleged \u201cRussian propaganda.\u201d\n\nThe anger of Democrats and liberals toward President Trump in his first month has added more fuel to the Russia-bashing with some Democrats and liberals seeing it as a possible route toward neutralizing or impeaching Trump. Thus, the calls for a full-scale investigation with subpoena power to demand documents and compel testimony.\n\nWhile the idea of getting to the full truth has a superficial appeal, it also carries dangers of launching a witch hunt that would drag American citizens before inquisitors asking about any contacts \u2013 no matter how innocuous \u2013 with Russians.\n\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, HUAC also claimed that all it wanted was the truth about whether some Americans were allied with or sympathetic to Moscow. Sen. Joe McCarthy offered a similar rationale when he was trying to root out \u201cdisloyal\u201d Americans with the question, \u201care you now or have you ever been a communist?\u201d\n\nThat Democrats and liberals who hold the McCarthy era in understandable disdain would now seek to rekindle something similar reeks of rank opportunism and gross hypocrisy \u2013 doing whatever it takes to \u201cget Trump\u201d and build an activist movement that can revive the Democratic Party\u2019s flagging political hopes.\n\nBut this particular opportunism and hypocrisy also carries with it the prospect of blindly ramping up tensions with Russia, diverting more taxpayer money into the Military-Industrial Complex and conceivably sparking \u2013 whether planned or unplanned \u2013 a nuclear Armageddon that could eliminate life on the planet. Perhaps this anti-Trump strategy should be rethought.\n\nInvestigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s.

Bernstein.\n\nBy Dennis J Bernstein\n\nOn Monday, January 8, the Trump administration announced that it would end protections for immigrants from El Salvador who had previously been covered under Temporary Protected Status in the U.S. since 2001. TPS is a legal designation for immigrants from certain countries which have experienced life-threatening situations, such as a natural disaster or war, and grants those migrants protection from deportation and the ability to work legally in the US. The termination of TPS for Salvadorans will take effect on September 9, 2018.\n\nPablo Alvarado is Executive Director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON), a coalition of worker-centered organizations across the country that defend day laborers from exploitation and extreme immigration enforcement, help people find jobs and recover wages, and train workers in health and safety.\n\nI spoke with Alvarado on Tuesday, January 9th, the day after the Trump administration announced its decision to rescind TPS status for Salvadorans. \u201cA lot of our members are people who come from Central America and particularly Honduras and El Salvador,\u201d said Alvarado. \u201cA significant proportion are beneficiaries of Temporary Protected Status for Salvadorans, which protects about 200,000 people with documents from deportation.\u201d\n\nDennis Bernstein: I know you have been in meetings all day, developing strategies, and dealing with the huge amount of fear that is sweeping through communities that you represent and advise on a daily basis. What is your first gut response to this latest move by Trump?\n\nPablo Alvarado:This action on the part of the Trump administration is not just an act of cruelty but also of hatred and of bigotry. This president decided to terminate an incredible program that has facilitated the immigration of thousands and thousands of migrants. Today, 30% of these people own homes, over 90% have jobs. And yet, in an act of cruel racism, this administration has decided to get rid of this program.\n\nTheir motivation is very clear: to reduce the number of non-white immigrants. They are scared of the changing demographics in our country. This is their way of slowing down the emergence of a new majority. They are no longer just going after undocumented people, they are taking away the papers of people with documents.\n\nDennis Bernstein: You are from El Salvador yourself. Could you talk a little bit about the kinds of violence that people fled during this period of US-supported death squads?\n\nPablo Alvarado: It is important to note how many times the US has intervened in Central America. The latest case is our recognition of a president in Honduras that 80% of the Honduran people don\u2019t want. Honduras will continue to be in flames for months to come. Already death squads are emerging and activists have been disappeared and tortured. Children are being gassed while protesting.\n\nAll of this will lead to even greater poverty and feed the cycle of migration. This is the same thing that the United States has done in El Salvador, in Nicaragua, and throughout the region. The widespread gang violence in El Salvador is something that was imported from Los Angeles. I can tell you that my two brothers, who are teachers and make $450 a month, are being extorted by gang members.\n\nTemporary protected status was introduced following the great earthquake [of 2001] but the reality is that El Salvador has not yet recovered from that natural disaster. The country is still in dire circumstances. There are many villages that subsist on the remittances of family members who are here in the United States. This action by the Trump administration is going to lead to an even larger humanitarian crisis.\n\nDennis Bernstein: Do you see this as a form of ethnic cleansing?\n\nPablo Alvarado: It is clearly an effort, as I said, to slow down the emergence of a new majority. This has always been the strategy of the people around Trump. They refer to it as \u201cattrition through enforcement.\u201d This involves making the lives of immigrants so miserable that they will want to pack their bags and leave on their own. Ending TPS is essentially a step in that direction.\n\nIt is interesting, right-wing pundits say that it is the Democrats who want to allow these immigrants to come because they want to turn them into Democratic voters. This is so ridiculous. These people are leaving their countries not to be able to vote here. They are fleeing violence and extreme poverty and persecution. Any country that respects human rights is going to want to provide safe haven to people fleeing such conditions.\n\nDennis Bernstein: What kinds of actions are you planning to take now?\n\nPablo Alvarado: We recently put together the National TPS Alliance, a coalition of about 50 committees of TPS recipients across the country who have come to Washington several times and are coming again in the first week of February. Prior to this recent decision, they were already doing lobbying work, trying to persuade politicians from both sides of the aisle of the seriousness of their plight.\n\nOut of those conversations, four legislative proposals have been introduced to provide a permanent solution for TPS holders. The administration may want to see TPS fade away in 18 months but we are determined to make these proposals a reality.\n\nDennis J Bernstein is a host of \u201cFlashpoints\u201d on the Pacifica radio network and the author of Special Ed: Voices from a Hidden Classroom.

Blockchain Stocks Are Next!\n\n\u2026 by the behaviour of Madame Tracy over the BREXIT negotiations. First there was Florence, which was essentially seen as a climbdown, now in this morning\u2019s FT I read of yet another backpedal where Juncker et al are demanding more and more to leave their exclusive little club. Whose cookie is beginning to crumble further around the edges in the Austria, Poland, Catalonia and Hungary.\n\nMy own suspicion is that this is a bargaining ploy, a delaying tactic to keep the markets stable and see how far the Eurocrats will go to try and up the Ante before telling them to get lost and open the doors to other nations, who if they\u2019ve got any sense already have their own low level negotiating teams in setting up trading deals for when UK Plc drops off the edge of Europe. However, I may be completely wrong and this may only be a ploy to feed to the Brexiteers that \u201cOh my God dwawleengs it\u2019s too, too difficult to get out so we\u2019ll have to stay in. Sorry, just not poss\u2026etc.\u201d But that would bury the Tories for a generation and leave the poor old UK to drop headlong into the hands of the weird and definitely not wonderful Corbynista\u2019s and subsequent economic free fall. So what is going on?\n\nThe Catalan situation seems to be bubbling under, with two separatist leaders under arrest for \u2018sedition\u2019, also two Police Officers for getting in the way of the Guardia Civil riot Police. See the France24 video below for the situation as of 17th October. Can\u2019t say I like the smug look of the Spanish deputy PM as she stepped up to the podium. There\u2019s a cat that\u2019s got first lick of the cream and no mistake.\n\n\n\nThen there\u2019s the Austrian election results. Which has the Eurocrats rattled. We\u2019re told that the results are a victory for the \u2018extreme right\u2019 but how \u2018extreme\u2019 is not wanting to import unspecified numbers of welfare dependents for which the Austrian taxpayer will have to foot the bill? As for \u2018rising extremism\u2019, how extreme is doing what the Americans call \u201cVoting your cheque book\u201d? Which is what electorates around the world are beginning to do. For example there\u2019s a widespread view that the EU is a monster which has grown too large and needs to go on a serious diet. Same for the US Government. Too big, too much power, too intrusive and rapacious.\n\nIn Canada we\u2019re still on the upslope of that bell curve with the Federal Government changing the tax regs to prevent \u2018Income salting\u2019 (Sharing tax allowances between family members) which will hit working families with stay at home mums the worst. Not the \u2018rich\u2019 like that idiot fop Trudeau in Ottawa says. Even Mrs S and I have been forced to formalise our business relationship so that everything I buy or do for her business is logged and subject to internal invoice. Which is a pain, but these are the toothpaste tubes big government forces everyone into.\n\nSource: https://billsticker.wordpress.com/2017/10/17/im-puzzled/", "domain": "beforeitsnews.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://beforeitsnews.com/eu/2017/10/im-puzzled-2631183.html"}

The references which had offended were the words \u2018trannies\u201d for transgenders and \u201ccross-dressers.\u201d The message from Facebook further suggested that gender \u201cidentity\u201d is considered a \u201cprotected characteristic\u201d (under the law \u2013 which it is not), and that reference to transgenders as \u201ctrannies\u201d could be considered \u201chate speech\u201d (i.e. a legal offence).\n\nA totally trivial issue, in itself, except that it goes to the heart of the disputed vision which encapsulates the present U.S. civil stand-off: On the one side, the notion that diversity, freely elected sexual orientation, and identity rights, equals societal cohesion and strength. Or, on the other hand, the vision encapsulated by Pat Buchanan: that a nation (including its new-comers) are bound more by the possession of a legacy of memories, a heritage of manners, customs and culture, and an attachment to a certain \u201cway-of-being,\u201d and principles of government. And it is this that constitutes the source of a nation\u2019s strength.\n\nThe point here, is that the \u201ccentrist\u201d center visibly is folding. The insistence to manage and control discourse (per Michel Foucault), around a strictly de-limited, political ideology is drawing now public disdain (and street demonstrations in the U.S.) targeted both at social media, and at elements of the MSM (mainstream media outlets, such as CNN). That is to say, the more the centrist diversity meme is pushed in the U.S., the greater the popular push-back, it seems.\n\nThe sites opposing such \u201ccorrectness\u201d are attracting a much higher audience than those espousing it. But that is not the whole story. It is not even the half of it: \u201cthe center\u201d is giving way on multiple fronts (with huge, and likely turbulent consequence).\n\nForeign Policy Chaos\n\nMost evidently, this is occurring in foreign policy generally, and in the Middle East more particularly. It has been only lightly reported in the MSM, but the U.S. National Security Council again has failed \u2013 according to reports \u2013 to offer any compelling arguments as to how America might, in any way, succeed in Afghanistan even with a hefty increase in military forces, (as advocated by NSC Advisor H.R. McMaster). It has been a long-haul war \u2013 and there will be no pleasing outcome to this war for anyone; rather the opposite \u2013 but that has been long evident to almost all who followed events there.\n\nSecondly, Hizballah has routed \u2013 in just four days \u2013 Al Qaeda from the Arsal enclave in north Lebanon. Once again, Lebanon is contiguous with Syria, just as Iraq is now contiguous, adjoining and open to Syria. Aided by the psychological shock to insurgents of the news of the halting of CIA of weapons and salaries supplied to (some, not all) insurgent groups, the Syrian army and its partner forces are quite rapidly taking back the Syrian state. The U.S. has decided, it seems, that there are no good options for America in Syria, either. And that, when Raqa\u2019a falls and ISIS is defeated, the White House may well conclude that U.S. objectives there will have been met.\n\nThirdly, the Iraqi people have been passing through a significant metamorphosis. Mobilized and radicalized by ISIS\u2019s physical brutality and ideological totalitarianism in northern Iraq, this is a nation in motion: The political landscape, henceforth, will change too. The Shi\u2019a of Iraq are sensing their empowerment.\n\nThe (unpopular) government, and the (respected, but now elderly) Hauza (religious leadership) \u2013 necessarily \u2013 are having to swim with this new tide of popular mobilization and self-assertion. These profound shifts in mood already are finding their reflection in Iraq\u2019s strategic positioning in that Iraq is moving closer to Russia (i.e. the purchase of Russian T20 tanks), and to Syria and Iran. The \u201cspine\u201d of the Middle East is consolidating in a new way.\n\nThis mood-change may well shape, too, the future of Sunni Islam: Most ordinary Iraqi Sunnis have been repelled, and disgusted, by the excesses of Wahhabist Da\u2019esh, (as have Syrians of all sects). Sunni citizens of Mosul \u2013 now free to relate their experiences \u2013 have been telling their Iraqi compatriots (I have been told) of their lingering anger at the ISIS\u2019s beheadings of the local Sunni clergy for complaining about the un-Islamic actions of foreign jihadists in the ranks of Da\u2019esh in Mosul. This adverse experience of Nejd Islam will have repercussions, ultimately, on Saudi Arabia and its leadership, (now heartily disliked in Iraq) \u2013 and America, Saudi Arabia\u2019s close ally.\n\nIn short \u2013 for Europe and America \u2013 the \u201ccenter\u201d of its Middle East policy is folding (while its Gulf Cooperation Council-led bulwark is in crisis). Across the West, cries of distressed Syria \u201chawks\u201d are in the air.\n\nThere will, of course, be repercussions: Israel will threaten that \u201cit cannot stand idly-by\u201d with Hizbullah and Iran situated on the Golan armistice line, and may try to test Russia\u2019s resolve as guarantor of the southwest Syrian de-escalation zone. Prime Minister Benhamin Netanyahu is particularly angry that Israel has been outmaneuvered in Syria (by Russian President Putin), that the hope to create an Israeli-controlled cordon sanitaire inside southwest Syria has been frustrated. And Israel and its allies now will push the U.S. hard for a punitive containment vice to be imposed on Iran in retribution.\n\nThe new Saudi Regent (Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salma or MbS) represents another unpredictable and volatile element in this mix. Despite this, the Pentagon is well aware that much of Israel\u2019s bluster concerning Iran, is just that: bluff. Israel, Saudi Arabia and UAE have no capacity to take on Iran, beyond a day \u2013 without America\u2019s full backing.\n\nWobbly Economic Center\n\nThe other part of \u201cthe center,\u201d which is looking increasingly wobbly, is that of economic policy. A consensus seems to be hardening among some market leaders that asset values cannot simply go on levitating upwards \u2013 carried up on a sea of liquidity, and near zero interest rates \u2013 entailing near zero volatility and one-sided trades that have the market listing like some capsizing, overloaded boat after all the passengers have rushed to one side of the craft.\n\nSome market participants however, seem to believe that the Central Bankers will never have \u201cthe spine\u201d either to hike rates, or to shrink their balance sheets, and thus face a market \u201ctantrum.\u201d These participants \u2013 until recently, perhaps a majority \u2013 believe that the new normal \u201cboat\u201d of low inflation and low rates \u2013 will continue to be floated off, practically indefinitely, albeit with the help of a further $20 trillion to $50 trillion of \u201cqualitative easing\u201d or QE.\n\nThis argument is far from new, but recently a substantial number of major financial leaders (and some Central Bankers) have been sounding grave warnings about the high multiple valuations of financial assets, about pockets of sub-prime debt re-emerging (automobile loans), and debt-to-GDP levels (personal and public) soaring above 2008 crisis values.\n\nGlobal debt is up $68 trillion or 46 percent, since the eve of the 2008 financial crisis, and now stands at 327 percent of global output. A critical mass of senior financial opinion seems now to be turning. They put this troubling monetary and market distortion against the prospect of a U.S. debt ceiling likely to guillotine U.S. Federal Government spending quite imminently, and against the probability that deeply conflicted Congress \u2013 with polarization in both main parties \u2013 being able neither to pass a budget; nor produce the Trump \u201creflation\u201d; nor even launch a significant infrastructure re-build.\n\nTheir fear is that there is a substantial tranche of congressmen and senators in both parties that are so hostile to Trump that they would be happy to see him fall flat on his face \u2013 even at the cost of economic crisis. Or, they worry that even if some stimulus is passed, that the Central Banks will remove the liquidity punchbowl from markets too fast. Either way, they see grave risks running through to the end of this year, and into 2018.\n\nIn short, not just foreign policy but financial policy, too, may find itself hostage to the dissolved center of U.S. politics \u2013 with all which that implies, i.e., the lack of the functioning, largely centralized, mainly cohesive unit, that used to be the American government as it has been known since World War Two.\n\nInviting Push-back\n\nAnd here we return to our initial, rather trivial anecdote about Facebook trying to re-establish the centrist meme of gender choice being an undiscussable \u201cprotected category.\u201d The point is that the center is not holding: the more it tries, the more it invites, and gets, willful push-back.\n\nEqually, as the hawks clamor to restore the former centrist foreign policy meme that arming, training and paying Wahhabi jihadists to slaughter 100,000 Syrian soldiers (many, if not most of whom, were Sunni) represents an American interest is no longer holding. See, for example, David Stockman\u2019s Bravo! Trump, For The Tweet That Is Shaking The War Party (Trump: \u201cThe Amazon Washington Post fabricated the facts on my ending massive, dangerous, and wasteful payments to Syrian rebels fighting Assad\u2026..\u201d).\n\nAnd the meme that too much debt should be solved by adding even more debt \u2013 and that the consequent soaring asset inflation should welcomed as mere confirmation that economic recovery is unfolding, as it should \u2013 is no longer holding also. This whole approach is now in in sharp contention.\n\nEven the Central Bankers now worry about asset inflation (that they themselves have nurtured) but they worry even more about the consequences of any attempt to roll it back. They lie between a rock and a hard place.\n\nWhere will this take us? Possibly, the psychological turmoil of the reverses in U.S. foreign policy will continue to roil throughout the summer; but come autumn, there may be less U.S. appetite (or attention available) for foreign policy initiatives as the economic \u201cwinter\u201d approaches. Or, at worst, the sheer overwhelming conflict on the domestic front could invite the notion that a foreign initiative would prove a welcome distraction from economic woes.\n\nIran and North Korea are the current U.S. rhetorical punch bags, but neither should ever be contemplated as candidates for some \u201cdistraction.\u201d Rather they represent potential nemeses.\n\nAs for the economic woes \u2013 not so much QE 4 \u2013 but direct, deficit funding helicopter money beckons, perhaps. Which is to say that freshly minted new, \u201cempty\u201d money would be used to directly fund Federal expenditure. (Trump in business, has never shied away from debt).\n\nOften it is said that there is no precedent to our present extraordinary monetary circumstances, but the history of the Assignat in France of the early 1790s, offers some hints. Despite massive money creation, Andrew White, in his book Fiat Money Inflation in France (published in 1896) notes that \u201c[t]hough paper money had increased in amount, prosperity had steadily diminished. In spite of all the paper issues, commercial activity grew more and more spasmodic. Enterprise was chilled and business became more and more stagnant\u201d.\n\nFinally, just to be clear, Donald Trump undoubtedly is facilitating the dissolution of the Establishment\u2019s \u201ccenter\u201d \u2013 but that, after all, was his declared aim. But he is not responsible for it. This potential was already latent: he simply saw it \u2013 and adroitly, climbed aboard.\n\nAlastair Crooke is a former British diplomat who was a senior figure in British intelligence and in European Union diplomacy.

Even bolder are Norway, which expects all new cars sold by 2025 to be electric, up from 37 percent today, and India, which set 2030 as its target date for going all-electric.\n\nTogether with the rising domestic popularity of all-electric and hybrid electric vehicles, the potential political contagion from such foreign programs is spurring major U.S. fossil fuel producers into spending millions of dollars to kill clean transportation alternatives.\n\nA shadowy outfit called Fueling U.S. Forward, devoted to promoting greater use of oil and natural gas, recently produced a misleading attack video called \u201cDirty Secrets of Electric Cars.\u201d The New York Times exposed the group as \u201ca public relations group for fossil fuels funded by Koch Industries, the oil and petrochemicals conglomerate led by the ultraconservative billionaire brothers David H. and Charles G. Koch.\u201d\n\nThe stakes, both financial and environmental, are high. The U.S. transportation sector currently consumes 14 million barrels of petroleum products every day. Transitioning away from all that gasoline and diesel to cleaner electric transportation will be critical to lowering carbon emissions before global warming wreaks havoc on human civilization and natural ecosystems. It will also help alleviate vehicle air pollution that kills an estimated 50,000 people each year in the United States alone.\n\nUnlike the power sector, where the renewable energy revolution is well underway across the nation, transportation remains largely stuck in the last century. In my car-friendly state of California, for example, thanks to a boom in solar and wind energy, electric power today accounts for only about 20 percent of statewide greenhouse gas emissions. Transportation, by contrast, contributes 36 percent, far more than any other sector.\n\nWhen charged by clean solar, wind, hydro or nuclear power, electric cars and trucks contribute almost no greenhouse or toxic air emissions. Even in states with a high proportion of coal-fired generation, efficient electric vehicles (EVs) account for fewer emissions than the average new gas-powered car.\n\nWith coal-burning plants increasingly giving way to cleaner natural gas-fired plants and renewable generation of energy, more than 70 percent of Americans now live in areas where EVs cause fewer emissions even than the cleanest conventional cars, according to recent research by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). On average, across the country, EVs create as little carbon pollution as gasoline-powered cars that get 73 mpg \u2014 if such cars even existed.\n\nCritics, like the Koch-funded Fueling U.S. Forward, complain that it takes more energy to manufacture an electric car than a gas-powered car, mostly because of the need for big batteries. But those manufacturing emissions are more than offset by the reduced emissions from driving a mid-sized electric car after just 5,000 miles, the UCS report notes.\n\nElectric Vehicles on a Roll\n\nElectric vehicles today number only about 2 million, or just 0.2 percent of all light passenger vehicles in use globally today, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). The good news is that their numbers are growing about 60 percent per year. In the United States, customers bought 53,000 electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in the first six months of 2017 \u2014 not counting Tesla sales \u2014 up from 33,000 in the same period a year ago.\n\nMomentum is growing in the EV industry. Tesla briefly this year enjoyed the highest market cap of any U.S. automaker. In July, Volvo announced that it plans to produce only hybrid or all-electric vehicles by 2019. China, which now leads the world in EV sales, has tough incentives to increase them further. A multi-nation coalition called the Electric Vehicles Initiative \u2014 including Canada, China, Finland, France, Germany, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, United Kingdom, and, for now, the United States \u2014 is encouraging the global deployment of 20 million EVs by 2020.\n\nIEA cites estimates that the global stock of electric cars will range between 40 million and 70 million by 2025, if governments continue to support R&D, purchase incentives, and charging infrastructure. The transition to EVs may accelerate if, as some experts forecast, they become fully cost competitive with gasoline-powered cars within a decade.\n\nBloomberg New Energy Finance projects that \u201ccars with a plug [will] account for a third of the global auto fleet by 2040 and displace about 8 million barrels a day of oil production \u2014 more than the 7 million barrels Saudi Arabia exports today.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration can be counted on to do what it can to slow this revolution, but 10 states have aggressive programs to promote the adoption of electric vehicles: California, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont. Just as with renewable energy, their success may pave the way for similar programs in other states, even \u201cred\u201d ones.\n\nFiscal conservatives should applaud their efforts to jump-start the EV market. A study by the American Lung Association in California last year documented health costs of $24 billion a year \u2014 for lost work days, respiratory illnesses, and premature deaths \u2014 from vehicle emissions in just those 10 states. The report estimated an additional $13 billion in climate-related costs (agricultural losses, flooding, fires, etc.). Converting two-thirds of cars on the road to electric vehicles by 2050 would save those states about $21 billion a year, well worth the effort.\n\nAnd if they succeed, proponents may also prove instrumental in helping U.S. automakers like Tesla, GM, and Ford remain world leaders in the fast-growing market for electric vehicles. The United States can\u2019t afford to be stranded in the slow lane of adapting its economy to climate change while the rest of the world speeds ahead.\n\nJonathan Marshall is a regular contributor to Consortiumnews.com.", "domain": "consortiumnews.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://consortiumnews.com/2017/07/28/the-worlds-shift-to-electric-cars/"}

The situation triggered international alarm and caused the United Nations Security Council to convene a meeting to explore ways to calm the tension.\n\nI spoke to Ramzy Baroud, editor of the PalestineChronicle.com, about the situation on the ground last weekend and the continuing moves by Israeli occupation forces to seize more and more Palestinian land in East Jerusalem and on the West Bank.\n\nDennis Bernstein: What are your thoughts on the tense situation and the standoff in East Jerusalem?\n\nRamzy Baroud: Well, the situation on the ground is quite difficult right now. As you know, there was this gun battle a few days ago, which resulted in the closure of the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Haram Sharif compound, one of the holiest sites for Muslims everywhere. This is the first time we have seen such a closure since the time of the Crusades. So this is a huge deal for the Palestinians and many fear this is an indication of a much more extensive political plan to normalize the annexation of East Jerusalem.\n\nWe have seen tens of thousands of Palestinian worshippers, mainly Muslim but also joined by their Christian brethren, prevented from entering the compound to pray. On July 21, Israeli [forces] installed metal detectors and, of course, the Palestinians are protesting this. The Al-Aqsa compound has been under the management of the Islamic Trust since an agreement was reached by the Israeli and Jordanian governments in 1967. Installing metal detectors is Israel\u2019s way of rejecting this agreement, which has been in force for five decades now.\n\nPalestinians are feeling a great deal of outrage and insecurity now in East Jerusalem. They fear this is part of a larger Israeli plan that brings right-wing politicians such as Benjamin Netanyahu into the same camp with extremist Zionists who believe that the mosque is built on the site of an ancient Jewish temple and want to destroy it. They have attempted to do so in the past but this recent violence has inspired many of them to believe that the moment is now.\n\nDB: Maybe you could put this latest violence into the context of the ongoing seizure of Jerusalem.\n\nRB: American politicians such as Trump tend to neglect the complexity of history. They assume that all it takes to be an effective politician is the ability to attract campaign contributions and win the support of powerful segments of the population. Truly wise politicians try to understand the repercussions of every decision they make.\n\nWith the Trump administration, there has been a kind of euphoria in Israel, particularly among the ultra-nationalists, the most extreme camps in the Israeli government and society. They feel that Trump is their messiah, not in a religious sense but in the sense that he is going to be the one to fulfill biblical prophecy. Trump has promised that he is going to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in defiance of international law, making the US the only country in the world to do so.\n\nWhether he actually carries through on the promise is not the issue. The message is loud and clear: The US is no longer following any kind of international consensus, on Jerusalem or the status of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. That changes the rules of the game entirely.\n\nNikki Haley, the new US ambassador to the UN, has repeatedly insisted on Israel\u2019s sovereignty in Jerusalem, on Israel\u2019s ownership of the Muslim and Christian holy shrines. I don\u2019t think we have seen anything like this since the George W. Bush administration and the Negroponte doctrine, which stated that the United States would not accept any UN resolution inconsistent with Israeli interests.\n\nBut what is happening now is even worse than that. We are not just seeing attempts at preventing United Nations institutions from speaking out against Israel\u2019s violations of international law. We are seeing a new level of very right-wing, indoctrinated outlook emanating from Washington. As a result, Israel has been extremely empowered.\n\nFor the Zionists, Nikki Haley is a godsend. She is the person who is going to change the status of Israel at the United Nations. Palestinians understand that something has been fundamentally altered in the nature of the relationship between Israel and the United States.\n\nSo there is an attempt to really push the limit. For example, last March the Knesset passed another reading of a law that prohibits the Muslim call for morning prayer. Again, this is something that hasn\u2019t happened for a thousand years. It is not possible to say this new position is just the work of a few extremists on the margin. We are talking about mainstream politics in Israel.\n\nIf this continues and there are no international repercussions, Palestinians will be forced to fight. What is happening in Jerusalem now are not clashes, it is about people wanting to go to their mosques to pray and thousands of Israeli soldiers blocking entry. If this continues, we are going to see a lot more violence in the coming days and weeks.\n\nDB: In April, the Israeli government announced that they are going to build 15,000 new housing units in occupied Jerusalem. That has got to to be wreaking havoc already.\n\nRB: We hear these astonishing numbers, as if the occupied territories have this unlimited space that can be constantly carved out and destroyed and rebuilt! These housing units are going to be built on Palestinian land, whether privately owned or not. People will find themselves homeless, entire villages will be wiped out. The Bedouins, in particular, are often the first to suffer.\n\nUnfortunately, when this happened, our media told us only part of the story: Three Palestinian brothers opened fire, killing two Israeli police officers. Anyone hearing a story like this is going to think, well, this is really quite violent and completely unacceptable. These officers are doing their jobs. But they don\u2019t understand the very violent context to this story: people being killed, being ethnically cleansed, being brutalized on a daily basis.\n\nPeople are being pushed to the breaking point. This doesn\u2019t mean that we are condoning violence but it must be understood that these types of violent actions don\u2019t happen out of context. Until we hold to account those who are illegally wielding power, the violence is going to continue and more people are going to suffer as a result.\n\nDB: It is my understanding that a lot of organizing is going on within the Palestinian community all over occupied Palestine and Israel. What is now happening at the holy sites is really getting attention not only in the region but all over the world. How do you see this in the context of the larger wars underway, the Syria connection, the way in which the Saudis are being even more empowered by the Trump administration? It seems that the Israelis are seizing the opportunity to do what they have been meaning to do in Jerusalem for so long.\n\nRB: Indeed, we see for the first time in many years the absence of an Arab consensus on Jerusalem. Not because Arabs don\u2019t care about Jerusalem, but because greater political urgencies are motivating the various actors. Saudi Arabia, at this point, is an embattled country, a country which is undergoing shifts in its political structure from within. The heir apparent has been replaced in a so-called \u201cpalace coup.\u201d\n\nThe Saudi\u2019s main concern right now is not Israel but Iran. The more they try to limit Iran\u2019s influence in the region, the greater this influence becomes. At this point we are seeing an almost open pact between Saudi Arabia and Israel. Those who dare operate outside the Saudi consensus, such as Qatar, find themselves immediately under siege.\n\nSo right now the political equation in the Middle East is changing. Israel is no longer at the center. Rather, you have Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Israel on one side, and Syria, Iran and a few others facing off against them.\n\nThis creates the perfect opportunity for Israel, if you think about it from a shrewd political standpoint, to do whatever they deem necessary for their political interests. In Washington, you have an administration that is completely blind to Israeli crimes and you have Saudi Arabia and its allies looking the other way.

Despite such threats, Assange continues his WikiLeaks work from inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London where he was given asylum five years ago.\n\nAssange was interviewed as a guest on the WBAI Radio show, Live on the Fly with Randy Credico and guest co-host Dennis Bernstein, executive producer of Flashpoints on Pacifica Radio.\n\nRandy Credico: Julian Assange, I just wanted to mention something that happened to me yesterday. A woman named Laura Krause called me last night. She is the sister of Allison Krause, one of the four students who were killed at Kent State on May 4, 1970, by the National Guard. She expressed her gratitude to WikiLeaks for finding and preserving some very important documents relating to that tragic event.\n\nJulian Assange: Interestingly, we didn\u2019t intend to specifically publish Kent State documents. It was part of our large archive of cable documents from the 1970s called \u201cThe Kissinger Cables.\u201d Often when you take the internal communications of the State Department or another powerful organization, it tends to touch on nearly everything. And the public\u2019s ability to spot relevant connections in your material often greatly outstrips your own.\n\nI am always extremely irritated with journalists who sit upon hordes of historical treasure detailing how our institutions actually behave. The public\u2019s ability to take this information and connect it to their own personal histories, using it in litigation and political campaigns, is actually much greater than the rather narrow character of any particular journalist or editor, including myself.\n\nDennis Bernstein: I just got off the phone with Oliver Stone, who is being shredded everywhere because he had the temerity to do a series of interviews with Vladimir Putin. Have you had the opportunity to see any of the interviews?\n\nJA: I\u2019ve seen all four. The last one was recorded after the US elections so it takes place within the context of this neo-McCarthyist Russia hysteria. Putin is the consummate politician, especially within Russia but also when dealing with the world. You cannot completely hide who you are over the course of four hours, and lots of little interesting things came out.\n\nFor example, in the third episode, Oliver Stone shows Vladimir Putin Dr. Strangelove, which Putin says he has never seen before. If he has genuinely never seen the film before, he has to be careful because he doesn\u2019t know how each scene or the film as a whole is going to pan out. At the end he says, \u201cWell, that\u2019s interesting, they even predicted some of the technical issues.\u201d And he points out that not much has changed in the dynamics of power.\n\nOliver Stone hands Putin the DVD case and Putin walks into another room in the Kremlin. When he comes back there is a slight smirk on his face and he shows the empty case to the camera and says, \u201cTypical American gift.\u201d Actually, he probably knew already that the case was empty when Stone gave it to him.\n\nDB: Julian, I would love to turn your attention to some of the breaking news around your struggle. I understand that your legal crew has taken your case to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Can you talk about the significance of that?\n\nJA: Well, it\u2019s significant for refugee law worldwide. I am very proud to have triggered it in some way. It is Ecuador that has formally gone to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Most of the members of the OAS [Organization of American States] respect their rulings, while the US considers them only as advisory. It is one of the most highly regarded legal bodies in the world, two others being the European and UN Human Rights Commissions.\n\nIn my case, Ecuador has the view that there are several human rights issues that have developed which require a proper hearing. Of particular concern are the obligations on states to assess refugee status and offer protection and how refugees should be processed outside the domestic territory, for example, in embassies, UN compounds, aboard ships, etc.\n\nThis bears on my situation but it also has a strong bearing on the situation in Syria and other places where you have refugees who are fleeing persecution taking long, dangerous treks into neighboring countries. If you process these refugees very close to their places of origin, you are going to save lives. It should be standardized how these people are processed, regardless of embassy or whatever.\n\nI think this is the most significant consideration of refugee law since 1969, when the optional protocol on the 1951 Convention on Refugees was signed by many countries at the UN. There was an attempt in 1975 to reconsider the issue, brought about by Australia. In the early seventies you had many refugees fleeing South Vietnam, coming down through the Indonesian archipelago to Australia. At that time Australia wanted to normalize the processing of refugees at its different embassies. The effort was blocked by the Soviet Union and the United States.\n\nSince that time, human rights law has really developed in earnest as a proper legal field, which puts obligations on states not to arbitrarily detain people and so on. Basically, many of these human rights instruments, when properly executed, force states to protect people, or at the very least, give states the right to protect people. If a state is obligated to protect people who are being persecuted, who are being threatened, then according to human rights law those refugees must be taken in.\n\nThere is an interlocking of the 1951 convention, the 1967 protocol, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with obligations under refugee law to enable consistency and avoid conflict. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights understands this and Ecuador has been great in taking on the case. There have been 54 amicus curiae from the UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees], the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Mexico and six other American States, a lot of legal clinics, and so on. We\u2019re now waiting on a decision from the Inter-American court but we know that it is definitely going to issue an opinion. They have already decided that this is a very important area of law and a hearing is going to be held in August.\n\nAnd, like I said, I believe this is the single most important attempt that has been made to harmonize international refugee law. I must say I am happy that something is emerging out of my situation other than just perhaps my freedom.\n\nThere is a lot of talk in the United States about the Trump administration\u2019s shutting down of migration and tourism to the US from some Muslim countries in the Middle East. I find it strange that there is so little discussion of what I feel is a much more serious situation: the shutting down of all refugee applications for 180 days. It is not reasonable to be accepting tourists from all over the world but not be accepting refugees.\n\nOkay, right now Syria is a very dangerous country to be accepting refugees from, you might have to shut down the system and take some time to reboot the process. But what about refugees from New Zealand or from Mexico? Are these likely to be ISIS people? Absolutely not. And if you are taking tourists from those same countries, it is completely absurd to block refugee processing.\n\nDB: Julian, this may be a naive question but\u2026.\n\nJA: Dennis, you know what they say: Better to be naive and fight for what\u2019s right, because it\u2019s the realists who have left the world in the shape that it\u2019s in.\n\nDB: Okay, I will just stumble toward the truth here, if I can. Do you consider the information flow out of the DNC to be a hack or a leak?\n\nJA: Well, this is a sourcing question. There have been a lot of flows out of the DNC over a two-year period, seemingly by five different actors, according to statements coming out of US intelligence. Actually, we haven\u2019t seen those repeated in 2017. We don\u2019t talk about sourcing in that way. We make sure that our publications are completely accurate and that our information did not come from a state actor. We haven\u2019t said anything about them and we probably won\u2019t, depending on how things develop. Because if we start giving more details, it makes it easier to catch our sources, which we obviously don\u2019t want.\n\nDennis J Bernstein is a host of \u201cFlashpoints\u201d on the Pacifica radio network and the author of Special Ed: Voices from a Hidden Classroom.

But the back story is no less disturbing.\n\nNine of the NSU\u2019s ten murder victims were immigrants, eight of them Turkish, one Greek. All ten were slain execution-style by the same Ceska Browning pistol. Yet it took more than a decade for police forces across Germany and the country\u2019s domestic intelligence agency, the Bureau for the Protection of the Constitution (BFV), to connect the dots that would link the homicides to Germany\u2019s xenophobic neo-Nazi netherworld.\n\nTroubling Background\n\nBut the question is whether the missed connections resulted from incompetence or complicity. Last summer, following reports of the massive shredding of BFV\u2019s files on right-wing extremists, the head of the agency tendered his resignation. Then in November, Der Spiegel reported:\n\n\u201cFour parliamentary committees [are] dissecting the work of law enforcement units four department heads have already resigned. The government\u2019s failures in fighting rightwing terrorists have plunged [the BFV] into the worst crisis since it was \u2026 set up in postwar Germany to stop precisely the kind of extremist thinking that allowed the Nazis to rise to power in the 1930s. The discovery of the NSU and its crimes has shaken the system to its core.\n\n\u201cThe more secrets come to light, the clearer it becomes how extensively intelligence agencies had infiltrated right-wing extremist groups. The trio of neo-Nazis that made up the NSU was surrounded by informants linked with [the BFV]. One of the big questions is whether [the BFV] actually strengthened military right-wing groups.\u201d\n\nHow the BFV worked at cross-purposes coddling neo-Nazis while supposedly constraining them is not entirely surprising in light of the circumstances surrounding the BFV\u2019s birth.\n\nWest Germany\u2019s first parliamentary elections in 1950 propelled into the chancellorship, Konrad Adenauer a stalwart of the same party as that of current German chancellor Angela Merkel, the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU).\n\nWhen Adenauer named Dr. Hans Globke as his Secretary of State, the West German chancellor laid his cards on the table. Globke\u2019s checkered past included wartime service at the helm of the Nazi Interior Ministry\u2019s Office for Jewish Affairs. He drafted the infamous Nuremberg Laws for the Protection of German Blood and wrote the \u201cCommentary\u201d that provided the rationale for genocide.\n\nThe Interior Minister who signed the Nuremberg Laws, Dr. Wilhelm Frick, was sentenced to death at Nuremberg and hanged in October 1946. Globke would appear to have been culpable, too, having advanced his career during Nazi rule. His immediate supervisor, Interior Ministry Legal Counsel Bernard Loesner, resigned following Hitler\u2019s decision to proceed with the extermination of European Jewry. When Loesner stepped down, Globke stepped up and left his fingerprints on the Final Solution.\n\nBut Globke was not only spared the fate of some colleagues tried at Nuremberg but emerged as an important figure in shaping post-war West Germany. In the 1961 book, The New Germany and the Old Nazis, T.H. Tetens, a German economist who worked for the U.S. War Crimes Commission, noted that Globke controlled every department of West Germany\u2019s government in Bonn and \u201chas done more than anyone else to re-Nazify West Germany.\u201d\n\nEx-Nazis Everywhere\n\nDer Spiegel revisited the same subject in a March 2012 article headlined \u201cThe Role Ex-Nazis Played in Early West Germany.\u201d It reported that two dozen cabinet ministers, a president and a chancellor had belonged to Nazi organizations.\n\nThe article reported that historians were poring through voluminous BFV files \u201cto determine how many of the Nazi dictatorship\u2019s helpers hid under the coattails of the domestic intelligence service in the earlier years of the Federal Republic\u201d and whether \u201cthe protection of the young, optimistic constitution [had been] in the hands of former National Socialists.\u201d\n\nBerlin historian Michael Wildt told Der Spiegel he was convinced that the postwar police and intelligence services had been riddled with former Nazis. Entire government departments and agencies, he said, \u201ccovered up, denied and repressed\u201d their murky history which evoked the following mea culpa from Der Spiegel\u2019s staff:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a charge that doesn\u2019t just apply to politicians and public servants, at least not in the early years of the republic. Senior members of the media, including at Spiegel, proved to be unwilling or incapable of sounding the alarm. This isn\u2019t surprising, given the number of ex-Nazis who had forced their way into editorial offices.\u201d\n\nAuthor T.H. Tetens noted the irony in Dr. Globke, \u201c[the] former key administrator in the Final Solution, [having] full control over the Office for the Protection of the Constitution.\u201d Had he lived long enough, Tetens might have suggested that the BFV be renamed the Office for the Protection of Neo-Nazis.\n\nTetens might also feel vindicated by recently released CIA documents describing another branch of German intelligence that Globke\u2019s controlled, the vast spy network run by Adolf Hitler\u2019s former espionage czar, Lt. Gen. Reinhard Gehlen, a.k.a. the \u201cGehlen Organization,\u201d a.k.a. \u201cThe Gehlen Org\u201d or, simply, the \u201cOrg.\u201d\n\nUntil 1955, when West Germany became a sovereign state, the Gehlen Org operated nominally under the aegis of James Critchfield of the CIA which paid for the Org\u2019s intelligence product. In reality, Gehlen ran the Org from its creation in 1946 until his retirement in 1968. In 1956, the Org officially became Germany\u2019s foreign intelligence service and was renamed the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND).\n\nRecently, the BND has been declassifying its files to come clean about its postwar origins. Documents released to date by both it and the CIA confirm suspicions that, at least in the Gehlen years, the Org/BND was little more than a U.S.-bankrolled \u201csheep-dipping\u201d operation for fugitive Nazis.\n\nThe U.S. Connection\n\nAnd this troubling history goes back even further to the days of World War II when the American intelligence agency, the Office of Strategic Services, fell under the control of a group of Wall Street lawyers who saw the world in the moral grays of business deals, measured less by right and wrong than by dollars and cents.\n\nIn the introduction to The Old Boys: The American Elite and the Origins of the CIA, author Burton Hersh identifies this common denominator: \u201cIn 1941 [the year of America\u2019s entry into the war}, an extraordinarily nimble New York antitrust attorney named William \u2018Wild Bill\u2019 Donovan inveigled Franklin Roosevelt into underwriting the first encompassing intelligence instrumentality, the Office of the Coordinator of Information [OCI].\n\n\u201cDonovan\u2019s profession was relevant, and it was no accident that all three [of The Old Boys\u2019] load-bearing protagonists Bill Donovan, Allen Dulles, Frank Wisner achieved status in America by way of important Wall Street law partnerships.\n\n\u201cThe faction-ridden [OCI] gave way in 1942 to the [OSS]. From then on a civilian-directed, operationally oriented spy service would top the wish list of America\u2019s emerging power elite.\u201d\n\nThese Wall-Street-lawyers-turned-spymasters brought their moral relativism and their ardor for aggressive capitalism to their World War II decision-making. Thus, they created an opening for Nazi war criminals who after Germany\u2019s crushing defeat at the Battle of Stalingrad in February 1943 saw the writing on the wall regarding the future of the Third Reich and started hedging their bets.\n\nAs the war ground on for two more years, thousands of them took steps to evade post-war prosecutions, in part, by arranging protection from British and American officials. Most of those American officials served in U.S. intelligence agencies, either Army intelligence or the civilian-run OSS, the CIA\u2019s forerunner.\n\nOSS spymaster Allen Dulles played into this Nazi game in spring 1945, as Soviet, British and American forces were converging on Berlin. Dulles engaged in negotiations for the separate surrender of German forces in Italy with SS General Karl Wolff.\n\nIt apparently didn\u2019t bother Dulles that Wolff, like many of his SS brethren, was a major war criminal. After September 1943, when Italy withdrew from the Axis and made peace with the Allies, Wolff\u2019s troops committed an average of 165 war crimes a day executing his orders to liquidate the Italian resistance and terrorize its supporters.\n\n(In 1964, a German judge sentenced Wolff to 15 years in prison for various war crimes, including ordering the deportation of 300,000 Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto to the Treblinka death camp.)\n\nPushing the Envelope\n\nInitially, Dulles met with Wolff in defiance of orders from the dying President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The contacts also were behind the back of Soviet leader Josef Stalin, whose army had not only turned the tide of the war at Stalingrad but was still doing the bulk of the fighting. As Hitler\u2019s Third Reich neared the end of its days, six out of every seven German divisions were lined up against the Red Army.\n\nUltimately, Dulles secured authorization for what was code-named \u201cOperation Sunrise,\u201d but his determination to consummate a deal with Wolff didn\u2019t stop at negotiations. When the Italian resistance set a trap for Gen. Wolff, Dulles saved him in what his OSS colleague (and future Supreme Court Justice) Arthur Goldberg described as treason.\n\nMoreover, when Soviet spies informed Stalin about the Dulles-Wolff assignations which continued even as the Red Army suffered 300,000 casualties in a three-week period the ensuing brouhaha played right into Hitler\u2019s own game plan for survival.\n\nDesperate to bolster the morale of his collapsing army, Der Fuehrer seized on the dissension opening in the ranks of the Allies. He gave his generals the following pep talk (as transcribed in Gabriel Kolko\u2019s The Politics of War):\n\n\u201cThe states which are now our enemies are the greatest opposites which exist on earth: ultra-capitalist states on one side and ultra-Marxist states on the other. [Their] objectives diverge daily and anyone can see how these antitheses are increasing.\n\n\u201cIf we can deal it [the alliance] a couple of heavy blows, this artificially constructed common front may collapse with a mighty thunderclap at any moment.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Wolff\u2019s surrender overtures to Dulles might have been an attempt to both save his own skin and help Hitler drive a wedge into the \u201cartificially constructed common front.\u201d\n\nThe overall value of Dulles\u2019s negotiations toward ending the war also was dubious. Less than one week before the general armistice ending the War in Europe, Dulles offered Nazi officers an advantageous deal, letting one million German combatants surrender to British and American forces on May 2, 1945, rather than to the Russians.\n\nBy surrendering to the British and Americans, most of these Germans not only avoided harsh treatment from the Russians but high-ranking Nazi officers benefited from the Truman administration\u2019s quick pivot from its war-time alliance with Stalin to the Cold War confrontation with Moscow.\n\nPresident Harry Truman\u2019s staunchly anti-communist advisers, including Secretary of State James Byrnes, persuaded Truman to default on FDR\u2019s commitment to a thorough postwar denazification of Germany, one in a series of decisions which enabled thousands of war criminals to avoid justice and permitted many to assume key positions in the new West German government.\n\nSteering the Cold War\n\nYet, the use of Nazis by U.S. intelligence agencies had the additional dangerous effect of letting the Nazis influence how the United States perceived its erstwhile allies in Moscow. Washington formulated much of its early Cold War policies based on information about Moscow\u2019s intentions that originated with Gehlen\u2019s blemished agents.\n\nThese infamous Final Solution perpetrators included:\n\n\u2013Willie Krichbaum, reportedly the Gehlen Org\u2019s top recruiter. As the senior Gestapo official for southeastern Europe, Krichbaum managed the deportation of 300,000 Hungarian Jews for extermination.\n\n\u2013Dr. Franz Six, former Dean of the Faculty of the University of Berlin and Adolph Eichmann\u2019s immediate supervisor in the Ideological Combat branch of the SS security apparatus. In 1941, according to a report he wrote (which Christopher Simpson cites in Blowback: The First Account of America\u2019s Recruitment of Nazis, and its Disastrous Effect on our Domestic and Foreign Policy), a Six-led SS commando group murdered 200 people in the Russian city of Smolensk, \u201camong them 38 intellectual Jews.\u201d\n\nWanted for war crimes, Six joined the Gehlen Org in 1946, but later was betrayed by a former SS officer working undercover for a US/UK dragnet for fugitive Nazis. In 1948, a U.S. military tribunal sentenced him to 20 years for war crimes including murder. After serving four, he was granted clemency by John McCloy, another Wall Street lawyer then serving as U.S. High Commissioner for Germany. Six then rejoined the Org.\n\n\u2013Gestapo captain Klaus Barbie, the infamous \u201cButcher of Lyon,\u201d who escaped via the so-called \u201crat lines\u201d to South America, where he then worked with right-wing intelligence services and organized neo-Nazi support for violent coups against elected and reformist governments, including the 1980 \u201ccocaine coup\u201d in Bolivia. After decades of spreading Nazi techniques across Latin America, Barbie was arrested and returned to France where he was given a life sentence in 1984 for ordering the deportation of 44 Jewish orphans to the death camp at Auschwitz\n\n\u2013SS Colonel Walter Rauff, who dodged postwar prosecution for developing mobile gas vans and administering their deployment to murder some 250,000 Eastern Europeans, mostly Jewish women and children. The appearance of Rauff\u2019s name on the list is interesting because, as the Milan-based SS intelligence chief for northwestern Italy in 1945, he was Gen. Wolff\u2019s liaison with Allen Dulles.\n\nAccording to a 1984 Boston Globe Op-Ed by former U.S. Justice Department lawyer John Loftus, Rauff, after playing his part in Operation Sunrise, calmly turned himself in and told agents of the U.S. Army Counter-Intelligence Corps (CIC) that he had made surrender \u201carrangements [with] Mr. Dulles to avoid further bloodshed in Milan.\u201d\n\nIn Loftus\u2019s words, Dulles \u201cpromised that none of the [surrender] negotiators would ever be prosecuted as war criminals. When Truman and Stalin discovered what Dulles [had been up to], there were outraged orders to call off Sunrise [But] Dulles went ahead anyway, with Truman\u2019s reluctant concurrence [Dulles] kept his bargain Rauff was released.\u201d\n\nChristopher Simpson confirms in Blowback that \u201ceach of the SS officers involved in Operation Sunrise [escaped] serious punishment despite the fact that each was a major war criminal. A U.S. military tribunal tried [SS intelligence chief] Walter Schellenberg, who had helped trap and exterminate the Jews of France. He was convicted but freed shortly thereafter under a clemency [order] from the U.S. High Commissioner for Germany, John McCloy\u2026\n\n\u201cWolff was sentenced to \u2018time served\u2019 in a [British] denazification proceeding in 1949, then released without objection from U.S. authorities. Fifteen years later a West German court tried Wolff a second time. He was convicted of administering the murder of 300,000 persons, most of them Jews, and of overseeing SS participation in slave labor programs.\u201d\n\nFleeing to Latin America\n\nHowever, when the war ended, neither the Gehlen Org recruitment program nor Wall Street lawyer McCloy\u2019s clemency rulings had begun, leaving tens of thousands of war criminals desperate to relocate in secure foreign outposts. SS Col. Rauff just happened to have the right connections to make that happen.\n\nIn Unholy Trinity: The Vatican, the Nazis and Soviet Intelligence, Australian investigative reporter, Mark Aarons, and former Justice Department lawyer Loftus reconstruct how Rauff became the mass murderers\u2019 travel agent of choice.\n\nShortly after the Wolff/Dulles surrender negotiations were successfully completed on April 29, 1945, Rauff was arrested by unidentified Americans and delivered to an OSS unit led by James Angleton, the future CIA counter-intelligence chief.\n\nFrom its description by Aarons and Loftus, Angleton\u2019s team appears to have been tracking communists in the Italian underground which would have been consistent with Washington\u2019s postwar policy of backhanding leftwing resistance leaders, from European partisans to Vietnam\u2019s Ho Chi Minh, irrespective of the magnitude of their contributions to the Allied cause.\n\nAngleton\u2019s team reportedly debriefed Rauff at length, probably about what he had learned when he carried out Wolff\u2019s orders to liquidate the resistance. After Angleton\u2019s team released him, Rauff established contact with his former SS colleague Friederich Schwendt who was already on the payroll of the U.S. Army Counter-Intelligence Corps (CIC) and, like Rauff himself, was wanted for murder.\n\nSchwendt was also a master counterfeiter. He laundered his product through banks, obtaining legitimate Western currency in return enough, in fact, that over the next three years, Rauff was able to furnish thousands of fellow war criminals false identities and one-way tickets to South America.\n\nRauff himself wound up in Chile, where he later reportedly advised Gen. Augusto Pinochet\u2019s ruthless secret police.\n\nAs for Allen Dulles, he became director of the CIA from 1953 to 1961. Under his leadership, the CIA overthrew democratically elected governments in Iran (1953) and Guatemala (1954) and replaced them with anti-democratic dictatorships. To this day, neither country has fully regained its democratic footing.\n\nAfter the CIA\u2019s disastrous 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion, President John F. Kennedy sacked Dulles, but Dulles did not wander far from the centers of power. After JFK\u2019s assassination two years later, President Lyndon B. Johnson asked Dulles to serve on the Warren Commission\u2019s investigation of Kennedy\u2019s murder.\n\nDulles died on Jan. 29, 1969. However, even today, seven decades after Dulles opened the door to U.S. collaboration with Nazi war criminals, his decision continues to infect government actions around the globe.", "domain": "consortiumnews.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://consortiumnews.com/2017/07/29/jerry-meldons-passion-for-history/"}

Add your two cents.\n\nHeadline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!\n\nHow and Why to Use SEO for Growth written by John Jantsch read more at Duct Tape Marketing\n\nSearch Engine Optimization is one of the more shapeless marketing terms we get to wrestle with these days.\n\nIt\u2019s not that people don\u2019t understand SEO, okay maybe it kind of is, it\u2019s that the very nature of SEO seems to shift with each new pronouncement from Google.\n\nOne thing is eternally clear, however (for today) \u2013 showing up, preferably towards the top of page one, when someone with a need goes looking for answer, product, or solution is a determining factor in the success and growth of just about every business.\n\nIn fact, SEO has in my view risen from the ranks of technical tactic to the status of full blow marketing and growth channel.\n\nToday, it\u2019s important to consider SEO as an option in parallel with other established lead channels such as Public Relations, Advertising, and Referral Generation.\n\nHowever, as we make this consideration, it\u2019s not enough to simply decide to add SEO practices to the mix, you must also consider when, where and how SEO can deliver the greatest impact.\n\nIn that regard it is most certainly not a one size fits all bag of tricks.\n\nSEO for growth is as much about strategy and mindset as it is about technical wizardry. And, it\u2019s about hierarchy and patience and consistency. You can\u2019t achieve the greatest results possible without laying a firm foundation and integration SEO practices with social media and content \u2013 it\u2019s all connected.\n\nTo get the most from any SEO practice it\u2019s essential that you understand the context in which SEO can most effectively be employed.\n\nIn the past, I\u2019ve written that I believe there are three stages of growth \u2013 traction, expansion, and optimization. I further believe that you must align the proper tactics with each of these stages, and this most certainly includes SEO tactics\n\nTraction SEO\n\nIn the traction stage, you\u2019re still trying to find that perfect match of ideal customer and market message. Your product or service is likely evolving, and it\u2019s a pretty good bet that you don\u2019t have sufficient content or domain authority to easily rank your content no matter how much optimization you perform.\n\nThat\u2019s your job at this stage. Create your editorial calendar and go to work on creating, at least, one piece of epic content per week.\n\nI know, a term like epic content is both worthless and scary sounding, but know this \u2013 the days of thinly written, 500-word restatement of the obvious ranking for your precious keywords are over.\n\nTake a look at the analysis of my content below from BuzzSumo and note the dramatic increase in average number of shares for longer form content.\n\nThe good news is that if you create truly useful content, you can start to use it in your lead capture and lead conversion efforts even as you begin to impact organic traffic numbers.\n\nExpansion SEO\n\nIn the expansion stage, you\u2019ve likely found some things that work. Your value proposition is getting easier to explain, and your content efforts are starting to pay dividends.\n\nExpansion is all about sustainability and increased growth rate. It\u2019s about retaining customers and finding ways to leverage relationships to do more.\n\nThe primary tool for expansion SEO is link building. Here again, I\u2019ve used another one of those scary SEO tools. Link building in the traditional old school SEO way of thinking was all about amassing links from pretty much anywhere as a way to show good old Google that lots of people liked your content.\n\nToday, link building has a lot more in common with networking and the quality of your backlinks is more important than the quantity.\n\nOnce again, content plays a role. One of the best ways to acquire high-quality, relevant backlinks is to take your epic content and start offering it to others. In some ways, this could be great advice for someone just getting started, but I do think you need some of your best content on your site.\n\nResearching and finding places that accept guest posts is a great place to start. Don\u2019t forget high authority local sites like Chambers of Commerce, Industry Organizations, and local government training sites.\n\nObviously, you want high domain authority sites to accept your content but start small and work your way up.\n\nTools like Pitchbox, Social Bloom, and BuzzSumo can help you locate relevant sites that accept guest content.\n\nClick here for some specific tips on effective link building\n\nConversion SEO\n\nThe conversion stage is, of course, where the money is. During this stage, you want to take advantage of your content and link building efforts and start leveraging the assets you are building.\n\nDuring this stage, the term Domain Authority will start to get very interesting.\n\nDomain Authority is the term used by SEO folks to give a point value to the ranking factors behind any domain. There are countless elements that go into constructing this algorithm, but suffice it to say if you can achieve a domain authority even approaching 50 on a scale of 100, you will have established a marketing asset that is likely to serve your business for many years.\n\nHere\u2019s a good description of Domain Authority from MOZ.\n\nSince domain authority is made up of many variables, it is extremely hard to influence unnaturally and for that reason, a link from a DA 60 site is far better than one from DA 10.\n\nYou can discover your domain authority and that of pretty much any site you like using the MOZ Opensite Explorer or a tool like Monitor Backlinks.\n\nAs the result above shows, a link from Entrepreneur would be very valuable\n\nOne of the most important ways to impact our DA is to acquire links from sites with higher DA. Now that you have a solid foundation of content and have established yourself as a reliable guest blog contributor, you can begin to run campaigns targeted to a list of higher DA sites.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that most magazines and high traffic publishing websites are looking for content, and you might be surprised how easy it is to get a guest spot or even regular contributing gig for a high profile online site.\n\nThis is also the stage where you should think about your place to invite guest contributors to your site. You can usually find individuals that already publish on other sites using a tool like BuzzSumo.\n\nIn many cases these guest contributors are also more than happy to promote the fact that they are published on your site, leading to more social shares and possibly even links.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to mine your social networks for potential contributors as well as any local strategic partners. You know, your banker, lawyer, and accountant might think it\u2019s awesome that you invited them to share their thoughts on your blog.\n\nNow, the reason I call this the conversion phase of SEO is that once you start receiving traffic, you go to work on making that traffic pay \u2013 that is the point, let\u2019s not forget.\n\nOne highly indexed, shared, and linked to blog post can turn into a lead generation gold mine with a few simple conversion tactics.\n\nTake the time to learn about building Facebook Audiences and you\u2019ll discover that you can effectively \u201cpixel\u201d visitors to your one or two winning posts so you can continue to market to them on Facebook or even build what Facebook calls \u201clookalike\u201d audiences so you can expand to reach an even wider net to drive to your site.\n\nOf course, once you start getting traffic to certain posts, even one or two, you have the foundation to build content upgrades that allow you to capture highly targeted leads by offering a video or checklist to accompany the post in exchange for an email.\n\nWith the right content, we\u2019ve seen conversion rates as high as 40% \u2013 meaning 40% of the people visiting the page took the offer for the upgrade and gave us their email address. (My current favorite for all manner of Lead forms is Thrive Leads)\n\nSince you\u2019ve read this far, you might be thinking that I\u2019m not even talking about SEO at this point \u2013 and that is precisely the point.\n\nYou can\u2019t have an effective SEO approach without understanding how to integrate your SEO channel with your overall approach to marketing and growth.\n\nBio: John Jantsch is a marketing consultant and author of Duct Tape Marketing[www.ducttapemarketing.com] and The Referral Engine[www.referralenginebook.com] and the founder of the Duct Tape Marketing Consultant Network.[www.ducttapemarketingconsultant.com]\n\nSource: http://www.ducttapemarketing.com/blog/seo-for-growth/", "domain": "beforeitsnews.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://beforeitsnews.com/business/2016/02/how-and-why-to-use-seo-for-growth-2810878.html"}

It was welcome news amid a deepening U.S. military commitment reflecting the intention to remain in the country for years to come.\n\nAs my recent article in The American Conservative documented, the net result of the program since late 2011 has been to provide arms to al Qaeda terrorists and their jihadist and other extremist allies, which had rapidly come to dominate the military effort against the Assad regime.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s decision to acknowledge explicitly its decision to end the program invites a more systematic analysis of why and how such a program, which was so clearly undermining a fundamental U.S. national-security interest, could have gotten started and continue for so long. The preliminary version of the program that began in late 2011 is easier to explain than its more direct form two years later, which had continued (at least formally) until now.\n\nOne of the keys to understanding its origins is that the program was launched not because of a threat to U.S. security, but because of a perceived opportunity. That is always a danger sign, prompting powerful national-security bureaucrats to begin thinking about a \u201cwin\u201d for the United States. (Think Vietnam and Iraq.)\n\nThe opportunity in this case was the rise of opposition protests against the Assad regime in spring 2011 and the belief among national security officials that Assad could not survive. The national-security team saw a shortcut to the goal.\n\nFormer Obama administration official Derek Chollet recalled in his book The Long Game that Obama\u2019s advisers were all talking about a \u201cmanaged transition\u201d and urging President Obama to publicly demand that Assad step down, according to Chollet. What that meant to Obama\u2019s advisers was bringing pressure from outside, including providing arms to the opposition.\n\nThat was wishful thinking not only in regard to the willingness of an Alawite-dominated regime to hand over power to its sectarian foes, but in regard to the assumed Iranian willingness to go along with toppling the regime. Not one of Obama\u2019s advisers had sufficient understanding of regional dynamics to warn the President that Iran would not allow their Syrian ally to be overthrown by an opposition supported by Sunni states and the United States.\n\nBut the decisive factor in pushing the administration toward action was the pressure from U.S. Sunni allies in the region \u2014 Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar \u2014 which began in autumn 2011 to press Obama to help build and equip an opposition army. Turkey was the leader in this regard, calling for Washington to agree to provide heavy weaponry \u2014 including anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles \u2014 to the rebel troops that didn\u2019t even exist yet, and even offering to invade Syria to overthrow the regime if the U.S. would guarantee air cover.\n\nPressuring Obama\n\nIn the ideology of the national security elite \u2014 especially its Democratic wing \u2014 regional alliances are essential building blocks of what is styled as the U.S.-sponsored global \u201crules-based order.\u201d In practice, however, they have served as instruments for the advancement of the power and prestige of the national security bureaucracies themselves.\n\nThe payoffs of U.S. alliances in the Middle East have centered on the military bases in Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar that allow the Pentagon and the military brass to plan and execute military operations that guarantee extraordinary levels of military spending. But enormous Saudi arms purchases and the financing of any covert operations the CIA doesn\u2019t wish to acknowledge to Congress have long been prime benefits for those powerful organizations and their senior officials.\n\nThen-CIA Director David Petraeus was particularly interested in ginning up a covert operation to arm and train the Syrian opposition. With the security bureaucracies supporting the allies\u2019 desire to unseat Assad, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, whose sympathies and political strategy always lay with the war, eagerly took the lead in the administration on arming the rebels and calling for a \u201cno fly zone,\u201d which the Turks badly wanted.\n\nDespite this set of interrelated factors pulling the administration toward a policy of regime change, Obama said no to heavy weapons, no to a no-fly zone, and no to an official U.S. role in arms supply. What he did agree to, however, was a covert CIA operation designed by Petraeus to load weapons from Libyan government stocks in Benghazi on ships and arrange for them to be shipped to the war zone. It was Obama\u2019s way of placating all of the actors pushing for an aggressive policy of regime change in Syria without being publicly committed to regime change.\n\nThat program, which began in October 2011, was halted abruptly by the attack on the embassy annex in September 2012. But by that time the Obama administration already knew that the weapons were falling into the hands of al Qaeda\u2019s Syrian franchise al Nusra Front, as administration official revealed to the New York Times.\n\nMeanwhile, the Saudis, Turks and Qataris were pushing arms to groups with military arrangements with al Qaeda\u2019s al Nusra Front at a feverish pace, and the Saudis had begun making deals in Eastern Europe for the heavy weapons, clearly intending to equip a large conventional army.\n\nThe danger signals of a policy gone horribly wrong could hardly have been clearer. But at that moment in the summer and fall of 2012, Clinton and Petraeus began a new push for the CIA taking on the role of arming its own hand-picked \u201cmoderate\u201d groups. Clinton argued in a White House meeting that the United States needed to have \u201cskin in the game\u201d in order to persuade its Sunni allies to steer weapons away from the terrorists. But Obama fended off that proposal, citing the blowback from the U.S. Afghanistan adventure (in the 1980s).\n\nWhile the debate continued in late 2012 and early 2013, the CIA did a series of studies \u2014 evidently ordered by the White House \u2014 of past efforts to build up insurgent armies from scratch. The conclusions were not encouraging, as someone defending Obama\u2019s position in the debate leaked to the Times.\n\nObama\u2019s Deadly Mistake\n\nBut then in early December 2012, Obama made a fatal political error: He introduced a \u201cred line\u201d \u2014 the use of a chemical weapon in Syria. Sure enough, within weeks the first rebel allegation of a regime sarin attack was made in Homs. And although the Obama administration quickly investigated and found that it involved tear gas, it was soon followed by a series of new claims of regime chemical attacks in March and April 2013, in which the evidence was very murky at best.\n\nOf course, Obama\u2019s national security team, in concert with the Sunni allies, pounced on the opportunity to push even harder for a new U.S. program of direct military aid to the \u201cmoderates.\u201d Obama sought to avoid being sucked deeper into the Syria conflict; the administration even got the intelligence community to issue an unusually inconclusive intelligence finding on the alleged chemical weapons attacks in late April.\n\nBut for a second time, Obama also agreed to a CIA program of helping to arm the anti-Assad forces; it was a way of placating his own national security apparatus and U.S. allies while avoiding an open commitment to the war. And when nothing happened in the secret program for weeks, Obama\u2019s national security team used an alleged crisis in the war to tighten the pressure on him to move more decisively.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry and unhappy CIA officials arranged for a rebel commander to call into a White House meeting with the claim that Syrian and Hezbollah forces were threatening to bring about the collapse of the entire anti-Assad war.\n\nKerry warned that Obama would be blamed by U.S. allies for the outcome and proposed missile strikes on Assad\u2019s forces. Within days, the White House ordered a new intelligence assessment that expressed \u201chigh confidence\u201d that the Syrian regime had used sarin repeatedly and immediately made its conclusion public.\n\nAnd simultaneously the White House announced publicly for the first time that the U.S. would provide direct assistance to the opposition and leaked it to the Times that it would involve military assistance.\n\nSo at the very moment when Washington should have been exerting pressure on its allies to stop pouring arms into an anti-Assad war that was systematically building up al Qaeda\u2019s power and influence in the country, the Obama administration was caving in to those allies.\n\nThe reason was simple: Powerful national security bureaucracies were threatening to blame Obama for the failure of their heroic effort to save the anti-Assad war.\n\nThe lesson of the entire affair is clear: A malignant alliance between powerful national security bureaucracies and the Middle Eastern allies with whom they enjoy mutually profitable relations are pressuring the White House to approve actions that threaten the real interests of the American people \u2014 including strengthening terrorists.\n\nThe only way to reverse that situation is to direct public attention to that malignant alliance of interests, which has thus far gotten a free ride.\n\nGareth Porter is an independent investigative journalist and winner of the 2012 Gellhorn Prize for journalism.

Russia! Russia!\u201d \u2013 but was surprised when Podesta spoke truthfully:\n\n\u201cEven though 20 percent of his voters believed he was unfit to be president, they wanted radical change, they wanted to blow the system up. And that\u2019s what he\u2019s given them, I guess.\u201d\n\nFor those millions of Americans who had watched their jobs vanish and their communities decay, it was a bit like prisoners being loaded onto a truck for transport to a killing field. As dangerous and deadly as a desperate uprising might be, what did they have to lose?\n\nIn 2008, some of those same Americans had voted for an unlikely candidate, first-term Sen. Barack Obama, hoping for his promised \u201cchange you can believe in,\u201d but then saw Obama sucked into Official Washington\u2019s Establishment with its benign \u2013 if not malign \u2013 neglect for the average Joe and Jane.\n\nIn 2016, the Democratic Party brushed aside the left-wing populist Sen. Bernie Sanders, who might have retained the support of many blue-collar Americans. The party instead delivered the Democratic nomination to the quintessential insider candidate \u2013 former First Lady, former Senator and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\nThough coming from a modest background, Clinton had grabbed onto the privileges of power with both hands. She haughtily set up a private email server for her official State Department business; she joined with neocons and liberal interventionists in pushing for \u201cregime change\u201d wars fought primarily by young working-class men and women; and after leaving government, she greedily took millions of dollars in speaking fees from Wall Street and other special interests.\n\nClinton\u2019s contempt for many American commoners spilled out when she labeled half of Trump\u2019s supporters \u201cdeplorables,\u201d though she later lowered her percentage estimate.\n\nSo, enough blue-collar voters in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania rebelled against the prospect of more of the same and took a risk on the disruptive real-estate mogul and reality-TV star Donald Trump, a guy who knew little about government and boasted of his crude sexual practices.\n\nHobbling Trump\n\nHowever, after Trump\u2019s shocking victory last November, two new problems emerged. First, Hillary Clinton and the national Democrats \u2013 unwilling to recognize their own culpability for Trump\u2019s victory \u2013 blamed their fiasco on Russia, touching off a New Cold War hysteria and using that frenzy to hobble, if not destroy, Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nSecond, Trump lacked any coherent governing philosophy or a clear-eyed understanding of global conflicts. On foreign policy, most prospective Republican advisers came from a poisoned well contaminated by neocon groupthinks about war and \u201cregime change.\u201d\n\nLooking for alternatives, Trump turned to some fellow neophytes, such as his son-in-law Jared Kushner and alt-right guru Steve Bannon, as well as to a few Washington outsiders, such as former Defense Intelligence Agency director Michael Flynn and Exxon-Mobil chief executive officer Rex Tillerson. But all had serious limitations.\n\nFor instance, Kushner fancied himself the genius who could achieve Israeli-Palestinian peace by applying the so-called \u201coutside/in strategy,\u201d i.e., getting the Saudis and Gulf States to put their boots on the necks of the Palestinians until they agreed to whatever land-grabbing terms Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dictated.\n\nFlynn, who served briefly as Trump\u2019s National Security Adviser, had led the DIA when it correctly warned President Obama about the jihadist risks posed by supporting the \u201cregime change\u201d project in Syria, even predicting the rise of the Islamic State.\n\nBut Flynn, like many on the Right, bought into Official Washington\u2019s false groupthink that Iran was the principal sponsor of terrorism and needed to be bomb-bomb-bombed, not dealt with diplomatically as Obama did in negotiating tight constraints on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. The bomb-bomb-bomb approach fit with the desires of the Israeli and Saudi governments, which viewed Iran as a rival and wanted the American military to do the dirty work in shattering the so-called \u201cShiite crescent.\u201d\n\nSo, because of Kushner\u2019s views on Israel-Palestine and because of the Flynn/Right-Wing hostility toward Iran, Trump fell in line with much of the neocon consensus on the Middle East, demonstrated by Trump\u2019s choice of Saudi Arabia and Israel for his first high-profile foreign trip.\n\nBut obeisance to Israel and Saudi Arabia \u2013 and inside Washington to the neocons \u2013 is what created the catastrophe that has devastated U.S. foreign policy and has wasted trillions of dollars that otherwise could have been invested in the decaying American infrastructure and in making the U.S. economy more competitive.\n\nIn other words, if Trump had any hope of \u201cmaking America great again,\u201d he needed to break with the Israeli/Saudi/neocon/liberal-hawk groupthinks, rather than bow to them. Yet, Trump now finds himself hemmed in by Official Washington\u2019s Russia-gate obsession, including near-unanimous congressional demands for more sanctions against Moscow over the still-unproven charges that Russia interfered with the U.S. election to help Trump and hurt Clinton. (The White House has indicated that Trump will consent to his own handcuffing on Russia.)\n\nA Daunting Task\n\nEven if Trump had the knowledge and experience to understand what it would take to resist the powerful foreign-policy establishment, he would face a hard battle that could only be fought and won with savvy and skill.\n\nA narrow path toward a transformational presidency still remains for Trump, but he would have to travel in some very different directions than he has chosen during his first six months.\n\nFor one, Trump would have to go against type and become an unlikely champion for truth by correcting much of the recent historical record about current global hot spots.\n\nOn Syria, for instance, Trump could open up the CIA\u2019s books on key events, including the truth about Obama\u2019s \u201cregime change\u201d scheme and the alleged sarin gas attack outside Damascus on Aug. 21, 2013. Though the Obama administration blamed the Assad government, other evidence pointed to a provocation by radical jihadists trying to trick the U.S. military into intervening on their side.\n\nSimilarly, on the Ukraine crisis, Trump could order the CIA to reveal the truth about the U.S. role in fomenting the violent coup that ousted elected President Viktor Yanukovych and touched off a bloody civil war, which saw the U.S.-backed regime in Kiev dispatch neo-Nazi militias to kill ethnic Russians in the east.\n\nIn other words, facts could be deployed to counter the propaganda theme of a \u201cRussian invasion\u201d of Ukraine, another one of Official Washington\u2019s beloved groupthinks that has become the foundation for a dangerous New Cold War.\n\nAs part of the truth-telling, Trump could disclose the CIA\u2019s full knowledge about who shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014, an atrocity killing 298 people that was pinned on the Russians although other evidence points to a rogue element of the Ukrainian military. [See here and here.]\n\nFurther going against type, Trump also might admit that he rushed to judgment following the April 4, 2017, chemical-weapons incident in Khan Sheikhoun, Syria, by ordering a retaliatory missile strike against the Syrian military on April 6 when the whodunit evidence was unclear.\n\nBy sharing knowledge with the American people \u2013 rather than keeping them in the dark and feeding them a steady diet of propaganda \u2013 Trump could enlist popular support for pragmatic shifts in U.S. foreign policy.\n\nThose changes could include a historic break from the Israeli-Saudi stranglehold on U.S. policy in the Middle East \u2013 and could make way for cooperation with Russia and Iran in stabilizing and rebuilding Syria so millions of displaced Syrians could return to their homes and reduce social pressures that the refugees have created in Europe.\n\nA Populist Party\n\nOn the domestic front, if Trump really wants to replace Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act with something better, he could propose the one logical alternative that would both help his blue-collar supporters and make American companies more competitive \u2013 a single-payer system that uses higher taxes on the rich and some more broad-based taxes to finance health-care for all.\n\nThat way U.S. corporations would no longer be burdened with high costs for health insurance and could raise wages for workers and/or lower prices for American products on the global market. Trump could do something similar regarding universal college education, which would further boost American productivity.\n\nBy taking this unorthodox approach, Trump could reorient American politics for a generation, with Republicans emerging as a populist party focused on the needs of the country\u2019s forgotten citizens, on rebuilding the nation\u2019s physical and economic infrastructure, and on genuine U.S. security requirements abroad, not the desires of \u201callies\u201d with powerful lobbies in Washington.\n\nTo follow such a course would, of course, put Trump at odds with much of the Republican Party\u2019s establishment and its longstanding priorities of \u201ctax cuts for the rich\u201d and more militarism abroad.\n\nA populist strategy also would leave the national Democrats with a stark choice, either continue sidling up to Official Washington\u2019s neoconservatives on foreign policy and to Wall Street\u2019s wheelers and dealers on the economy \u2013 or return to the party\u2019s roots as the political voice for the common man and woman.\n\nBut do I think any of this will happen? Not really. Far more likely, the Trump presidency will remain mired in its \u201creality-TV\u201d squabbles with the sort of coarse language that would normally be bleeped out of network TV; the Democrats will continue substituting the Russia-gate blame-game for any serious soul-searching; the Republicans will press on with more tax cuts for the rich; and the Great American Experiment with Democracy will continue to flounder into chaos.\n\nInvestigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s.

(now Attorney General) Jeff Sessions at Washington\u2019s Mayflower Hotel \u2014 have been dropped as innocent or inconsequential.\n\nBut like all good conspiracy theories, once one allegation is dismissed as meaningless, it is replaced by another and another.\n\nIn the old days, journalists might have expressed some concern that Facebook \u201cfound\u201d the \u201cRussia-linked\u201d ads only under extraordinary pressure from powerful politicians, such as Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a leading legislator on the tech industry. But today\u2019s mainstream reporters took Warner\u2019s side and made it look like Facebook had been dragging its heels and that there must be much more out there.\n\nHowever, it doesn\u2019t really seem to matter how little evidence there is. Anything will do.\n\nEven the paltry $100,000 is not put in any perspective (Facebook has annual revenue of $27 billion), nor the 201 Twitter accounts (compared to Twitter\u2019s 328 million monthly users). Nor are the hazy allegations of \u201csuspected \u2026 links to Russia\u201d subjected to serious inspection. Although Russia is a nation of 144 million people and many divergent interests, it\u2019s assumed that everything must be personally ordered by President Vladimir Putin.\n\nYet, if you look at some of the details about these $100,000 in ads, you learn the case is even flimsier than you might have thought. The sum was spread out over 2015, 2016 and 2017 \u2013 and thus represented a very tiny pebble in a very large lake of Facebook activity.\n\nBut more recently we learned that only 44 percent of the ads appeared before Americans went to the polls last November, according to Facebook; that would mean that 56 percent appeared afterwards.\n\nFacebook added that \u201croughly 25% of the ads were never shown to anyone. \u2026 For 50% of the ads, less than $3 was spent; for 99% of the ads, less than $1,000 was spent.\u201d\n\nSo, as minuscule as the $100,000 in ad buys over three years may have seemed, the tiny pebble turns out really to be only a fraction of a tiny pebble if the Russians indeed did toss it into the 2016 campaign.\n\nWhat About the Puppies?\n\nWe further have learned that most ads weren\u2019t for or against a specific candidate, but rather addressed supposedly controversial issues that the mainstream media insists were meant to divide the United States and thus somehow undermine American democracy.\n\nExcept, it turns out that one of the issues was puppies.\n\nAs Mike Isaac and Scott Shane of The New York Times reported in Tuesday\u2019s editions, \u201cThe Russians who posed as Americans on Facebook last year tried on quite an array of disguises. \u2026 There was even a Facebook group for animal lovers with memes of adorable puppies that spread across the site with the help of paid ads.\u201d\n\nNow, there are a lot of controversial issues in America, but I don\u2019t think any of us would put puppies near the top of the list. Isaac and Shane reported that there were also supposedly Russia-linked groups advocating gay rights, gun rights and black civil rights, although precisely how these divergent groups were \u201clinked\u201d to Russia or the Kremlin was never fully explained. (Facebook declined to offer details.)\n\nAt this point, a professional journalist might begin to pose some very hard questions to the sources, who presumably include many partisan Democrats and their political allies hyping the evil-Russia narrative. It would be time for some lectures to the sources about the consequences for taking reporters on a wild ride in conspiracy land.\n\nYet, instead of starting to question the overall premise of this \u201cscandal,\u201d journalists at The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, etc. keep making excuses for the nuttiness. The explanation for the puppy ads was that the nefarious Russians might be probing to discover Americans who might later be susceptible to propaganda.\n\n\u201cThe goal of the dog lovers\u2019 page was more obscure,\u201d Isaac and Shane acknowledged. \u201cBut some analysts suggested a possible motive: to build a large following before gradually introducing political content. Without viewing the entire feed from the page, now closed by Facebook, it is impossible to say whether the Russian operators tried such tactics.\u201d\n\nThe Joe McCarthy of Russia-gate\n\nThe Times then turned to Clinton Watts, a former FBI agent and a top promoter of the New McCarthyism that has swept Official Washington. Watts has testified before Congress that almost anything that appears on social media these days criticizing a politician may well be traceable to the Russians.\n\nFor instance, last March, Watts testified in conspiratorial terms before the Senate Intelligence Committee about \u201csocial media accounts discrediting U.S. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.\u201d At the time, Ryan was under criticism for his ham-handed handling of a plan to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d Obamacare, but Watts saw possible Russian fingerprints.\n\nWatts also claimed that Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s presidential bid \u201canecdotally suffered\u201d from an online Russian campaign against him, though many of you may have thought Rubio flamed out because he was a wet-behind-the-ears candidate who performed robotically in the debates and received the devastating nickname \u201cLittle Marco\u201d from Donald Trump.\n\nWatts explained that these nefarious Russian schemes left no discernible earmarks or detectable predictability. Russians attack \u201cpeople on both sides of the aisle \u2026 solely based on what they [the Russians] want to achieve in their own landscape, whatever the Russian foreign policy objectives are,\u201d Watts complained.\n\nWatts\u2019s vague allegations appear to have been the impetus behind Sen. Warner\u2019s repeated demands that Facebook find some evidence to support the suspicions. After Facebook came up empty twice, Warner flew to Silicon Valley to personally confront Facebook executives who then found what Warner wanted them to find, the $100,000 in suspected Russia-linked ad buys.\n\nSo, it perhaps made sense that the Times would turn to Watts to explain the rather inexplicable Russian exploitation of puppies. According to Isaac and Shane, Watts \u201csaid Russia had been entrepreneurial in trying to develop diverse channels of influence. Some, like the dogs page, may have been created without a specific goal and held in reserve for future use. \u2018They were creating many audiences on social media to try to influence around,\u2019 said Mr. Watts, who has traced suspected Russian accounts since 2015.\u201d\n\nIn other words, if you start with the need to prove Russian guilt, there are no alternative explanations besides Russian guilt. If some fact, like the puppies page, doesn\u2019t seem to fit the sinister conspiracy theory, you simply pound it into place until it does.\n\nYes, of course, Russian intelligence operatives must be so sneaky that they are spending money (but not much) on Facebook puppy ads so they might sometime in the future slip in a few other ideological messages. It can\u2019t be that perhaps the ads were not part of some Russian government intelligence operation.\n\nThe Russ-kie Plot\n\nBut even if we want to believe that these ads are a Russ-kie plot and were somehow intended to sow dissension in the U.S., the totals are insignificant, a subset of a subset of a subset of $100,000 in ad buys over three years that, as far as anyone can tell, had no real no impact on the 2016 election \u2013 and surely much, much, much less than the political influence from, say, Israel.\n\nIf we apply Facebook\u2019s 44 percent figure, that would suggest the total spending in the two years before the election was around $44,000 and much of that focused on a diverse set of issues, not specific candidates. So, if some Russians did spend money to promote gay rights and to push gun rights, any negligible impact on the 2016 election would more or less have been canceled out between Clinton and Trump.\n\nYet, over these still unproven and speculative allegations of Russian \u201clinks\u201d to these Facebook ads, the national Democrats and their mainstream media allies are stoking a dangerous and expensive New Cold War with nuclear-armed Russia.\n\nI realize that lots of Democrats were upset about Hillary Clinton\u2019s humiliating defeat and don\u2019t want to believe that she could have lost fairly to a buffoon like Donald Trump. So, they are looking for any excuses rather than looking in the mirror.\n\nThe major U.S. news outlets also have joined the anti-Trump Resistance, rather than upholding the journalistic principles of objectivity and fairness. The Post even came up with a new melodramatic slogan for the moment: \u201cDemocracy Dies in Darkness.\u201d\n\nBut yellow journalism is not the way to shed light into darkness; it only blinds Democrats from seeing the real reasons behind Trump\u2019s appeal to many working-class whites who feel disaffected from a Democratic Party that seems disinterested in their suffering.\n\nYes, I know that some Democrats are still hoping against hope that they can ride Russia-gate all the way to Trump\u2019s impeachment and get him ridden out of Washington D.C. on a rail, but the political risk to Democrats is that they will harden the animosity that many in the white working class already feel toward the party.\n\nThat could do more to strengthen Trump\u2019s appeal to these voters than to weaken him, while hollowing out Democratic support among millions of peace voters who may simply declare a plague on both parties.\n\nInvestigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s.

On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court gave him and other former senior Bush administration officials legal immunity for the vicious abuses committed against more than 700 foreigners who were rounded up with little or no cause after the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThe court ruled 4-2, nearly 16 years after the fact, that \u201cnational security\u201d trumps civil liberties and that however unfounded the arrests, or intolerable their treatment, the detainees had no right to sue senior federal officials for damages.\n\nPunting to Congress, a branch of government rarely known for its defense of individual rights, the court declared, \u201cThe proper balance in situations like this, between deterring constitutional violations and freeing high officials to make the lawful decisions necessary to protect the Nation in times of great peril, is one for the Congress to undertake, not the Judiciary.\u201d\n\nAlthough the climate of fear that followed 9/11 has eased a bit, the decision is highly relevant in the Trump era because the abused victims were all immigrants who had overstayed their visas. If the FBI had any question about the arrestees, it designated them \u201cof interest\u201d and ordered them held until cleared \u2014 in other words, guilty until proven innocent.\n\nDozens of the hapless victims were held at the Administrative Maximum Special Housing Unit in Brooklyn\u2019s Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC), which was the subject of two scathing reports by the Bush Justice Department\u2019s own Inspector General in 2003. Besides documenting a wide range of abuses, the reports concluded that staff members brazenly lied about the rough treatment they meted out.\n\nAppalling Abuses\n\nNews accounts of the Supreme Court decision made only brief reference to that treatment. Yet the appalling story can be glimpsed from this summary of facts provided in 2013 by U.S. District Judge John Gleeson:\n\n\u201cThe harsh confinement policy was expressly directed at Arab and Muslim noncitizens who had violated immigration laws . . . In other words, it was discriminatory on its face. . .\n\n\u201cThey were confined in tiny cells for over 23 hours a day, provided with meager and barely edible food, and prohibited from moving around the unit . . . (or) keeping any property, including personal hygiene items like toilet paper and soap, in their cells. Whenever they left their cells, they were handcuffed and shackled. . . (D)etainees . . . were often physically abused along the way, and were sometimes left for hours in the cold recreation cell, over their protests, as a form of punishment. . . .\n\n\u201cDetainees also were denied sleep. Bright lights were kept on . . . for 24 hours a day . . . and staff at the MDC made a practice of banging on the MDC Detainees\u2019 cell doors and engaging in other conduct designed to keep them from sleeping. They also conducted inmate \u2018counts\u2019 at midnight, 3:00 a.m., and 5:00 a.m. . . . One of the officers walked by about every 15 minutes throughout the night, kicked the doors to wake up the detainees, and yelled things such as, \u2018Motherfuckers,\u2019 \u2018Assholes,\u2019 and \u2018Welcome to America.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe MDC Detainees also were subjected to frequent physical and verbal abuse . . . The physical abuse included slamming the MDC Detainees into walls; bending or twisting their arms, hands, wrists, and fingers; lifting them off the ground by their arms; pulling on their arms and handcuffs; stepping on their leg restraints; restraining them with handcuffs and/or shackles even while in their cells; and handling them in other rough and inappropriate ways. The use of such force was unnecessary because the MDC Detainees were always fully compliant with orders . . . The verbal abuse included referring to the MDC Detainees as \u2018terrorists\u2019 and other offensive names, threatening them with violence, cursing at them, (and) insulting their religion . . .\n\n\u201c(Detainees) . . . were subjected to unreasonable and punitive strip-searches. . . Female officers were often present during the strip-searches; the strip-searches were regularly videotaped in their entirety . . . and MDC officers routinely laughed and made inappropriate sexual comments during the strip-searches.\n\n\u201cOfficers at the MDC . . . also interfered with the Detainees\u2019 ability to practice and observe their Muslim faith. . . In addition, most of the MDC Detainees were held incommunicado during the first weeks of their detention. MDC staff repeatedly turned away everyone, including lawyers and relatives, who came to the MDC looking for the MDC Detainees, and thus the MDC Detainees had neither legal nor social visits during this period.\u201d\n\nAn Abu Ghraib in Brooklyn\n\nThough not at the level of brutality of water boarding and some of the beatings associated with secret CIA detention centers, these MDC abuses had some similarities to the humiliation and mistreatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib in Iraq \u2014 and the abuses were taking place right in the heart of New York City. Plus, unlike some of the CIA\u2019s torture victims, these detainees had nothing to do with terrorist plots; some were never even questioned by the FBI after their arrest.\n\nYet senior FBI and Justice Department officials were complicit in the abuse. The 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 2015 ruling that the lawsuit could proceed, cited evidence that two of the defendants, Attorney General John Ashcroft and FBI Director Mueller, \u201cmet regularly with a small group of government officials in Washington, D.C., and mapped out ways to exert maximum pressure on the individuals arrested in connection with the terrorism investigation.\u201d\n\nThey \u201cdiscussed and decided upon a strategy to restrict the 9/11 detainees\u2019 ability to contact the outside world and delay their immigration hearings. The group also decided to spread the word among law enforcement personnel that the 9/11 detainees were suspected terrorists[] . . . and that they needed to be encouraged in any way possible to cooperate.\u201d And it was the FBI that recommended housing the detainees in the maximum security facility where their rights were sure to be abused.\n\nSuch official misconduct and brutality constitutes a stain on this nation\u2019s honor. Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority, said \u201cNothing in this opinion should be read to condone the treatment to which the (plaintiffs) contend they were subjected.\u201d\n\nA Terrible Precedent\n\nBut the court\u2019s decision to protect high-level federal officials who made that treatment possible sets a terrible precedent. As the American Civil Liberties Union warned, it \u201cwould effectively immunize tens of thousands of federal officers . . . from damages, no matter how egregious the officers\u2019 conduct. Indeed, [it] would effectively immunize federal officers from damages liability even for torture, so long as the torture arises in a context involving national security or noncitizens.\u201d\n\nCiting such egregious precedents as the Alien and Sedition Acts, the wholesale suppression of civil liberties during World War I, and the internment of Japanese-American citizens during World War II, a dissenting Justice Stephen Breyer insisted that the Court had an obligation to defend \u201cfundamental constitutional rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cHistory tells us of far too many instances where the Executive or Legislative Branch took actions during time of war that, on later examination, turned out unnecessarily and unreasonably to have deprived American citizens of basic constitutional rights,\u201d he wrote. With the latest court ruling, that dark history is sure to be repeated.\n\n[For more on the real Robert Mueller, see Consortiumnews.com\u2019s \u201cRussia-gate\u2019s Mythical Heroes.\u201d]\n\nJonathan Marshall is a regular contributor to Consortiumnews.com.", "domain": "consortiumnews.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://consortiumnews.com/2017/06/21/at-fbi-mueller-oversaw-post-911-torture/"}

The Jews were used as a tool under the concept of the promised land \u2014 call it whatever you want. Everything has been made up.\u201d Attacking Trump\u2019s Jerusalem decision, he used the phrase Yekhreb beitak, which means \u201cMay God demolish your house\u201d. The phrase can have different connotations, from a harsh to a casual insult, but is often regarded as cursing. He will continue to support payments to Palestinian terrorists and their families: \u201cPrisoners and their family members are our sons, and we will continue to give them stipends.\u201d Another lie: \u201cIsrael has imported frightening amounts of drugs in order to destroy our younger generation.\u201d He refused to let go of his upset with Britain: \u201cwe continue to demand an apology from the British for the Balfour Declaration, and we will continue to demand their recognition of a Palestinian state. He lashed out at the US, Israel, Britain and even other Arab leaders, whom he told to \u201cgo to hell\u201d for criticising him. He pronounced the peace process dead, and accused Israel of killing it. He fabricated a complete lie about Theodor Herzl: \u201cHerzl\u2019s phrase \u2018a land without a people for a people without a land\u2019 was made up. He arrived here and saw a people, and for that reason, spoke of the need to get rid of the Palestinians.\u201d About Ambassador Friedman and Ambassador Haley: \u201cU.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman is a settler who is opposed to the term occupation. He is an offensive human being, and I will not agree to meet with him anywhere. They requested that I meet him and I refused, not in Jerusalem, not in Amman, not in Washington. U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley too, she threatens to hit people who hurt Israel with the heel of her shoe, and we\u2019ll respond in the same way.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile PM Netanyahu said, \u201cI think Abbas is doing what he\u2019s doing because he apparently fears a US-led peace initiative. He\u2019s trying to remove the Americans from their capacity as mediators and replace them with someone else.\n\n\u201cFor too long, the Palestinian Authority has been coddled by the international community, which dared not to speak truth to them\u2014not on Jerusalem, not on recognizing Israel and regarding other measures and demands made by them. They have always gotten a soft touch, and now that\u2019s changed. It\u2019s the first time somebody told the truth to their faces,\u201d Netanyahu stated.\n\nHaley slams Abbas over \u2018hate-filled\u2019 speech By Michael Wilner, January 25, 2018: \u201cHate-filled speeches and end-runs around negotiations take us nowhere,\u201d US Envoy tells UN Security Council. WASHINGTON \u2014 Following a warning from President Donald Trump that the United States will cut aid to the Palestinians if they refuse to enter peace talks with Israel, his ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, specified the administration\u2019s criticism to PA President Mahmoud Abbas, questioning his ability to lead his people to peace. Haley focused her criticism of Abbas around a speech he delivered earlier this month that has \u201cgotten little attention in the media,\u201d she told a monthly gathering of the UN Security Council. \u201cHe rejected any American role in peace talks. He insulted the American president. He called for suspending recognition of Israel,\u201d Haley says, slamming Abbas for spreading \u201coutrageous and discredited conspiracy\u201d theories, which included the assertion that Jews have no claim to the land. \u201cHate-filled speeches and end-runs around negotiations take us nowhere,\u201d she said, comparing Abbas\u2019 rhetoric to that of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat\u2019s speech to the Knesset in 1977, months shy of an historic peace agreement. \u201cI ask here today, where is the Palestinian King Hussein? Where is the Palestinian Anwar Sadat? If President Abbas demonstrates he can be that type of leader, we would welcome it. his recent actions demonstrate the total opposite.\u201d Within an administration divided over whether to slash funding to the Palestinians in part or in whole, Haley has been an advocate for draconian cuts. Her short tenure as ambassador to the UN has been dominated by her robust defense of Israel in its many agencies. \u201cWe will not chase after a Palestinian leadership that lacks what is needed to achieve peace,\u201d she said.\n\nSource: https://pamelageller.com/2018/01/haley-slams-abbas.html/", "domain": "beforeitsnews.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://beforeitsnews.com/opinion-conservative/2018/01/nikki-haley-slams-pa-terror-prez-abbas-over-shocking-hate-filled-speech-3357454.html"}

President Donald Trump, for instance, last week called Qatar \u201ca major sponsor\u201d of terrorism, ignoring that Saudi Arabia is a big supporter, too.\n\nTension between Qatar \u2014 with its independent foreign policy \u2014 and Saudi Arabia \u2014 with its allies United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt \u2014 has been building for years. Earlier in June, the four nations imposed an economic blockade on Qatar and cut diplomatic ties. They closed their airspace to Qatar Airways. Food imports, on which Qatar depends, were blocked at the country\u2019s only land border, which is with Saudi Arabia.\n\nAfter U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged an end to the economic embargo and called on the Saudis to make \u201creasonable\u201d proposals, Riyadh on Friday released a list of 13 demands, designed to be rejected by Doha. Saudi Arabia laid down a 10-day deadline for Qatar to respond by July 7. The Saudis did not say what would happen next, but the signs are ominous.\n\nQatar has already rejected the demands as unrealistic. Among them is for Qatar to break all ties with Iran, to stop supporting the Muslim Brotherhood, and to shut down the Al Jazeera television network. The Brotherhood seeks to institute an Islamist agenda through the ballot box, a threat to the monarchist Saudis and their Egyptian clients. Al Jazeera\u2019s broadcasting helped stir up popular revolt during the failed Arab Spring, another threat to Saudi rule.\n\nFurther, if Riyadh intends to go to war with its regional rival, Shi\u2019ite Iran, it needs U.S. support. The largest U.S. military base in the Middle East is in Qatar, which would have to be on board for an attack.\n\nA Green Light\n\nIn Syria and Afghanistan, Trump has left decisions largely up to the military, rendering many of his tweets and statements irrelevant. But Trump is asserting himself in the Gulf crisis. He even tried to take credit for the embargo after his visit to Riyadh last month, where he also met the Qatari emir. While the Pentagon and the State Department want a mediated settlement, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Friday the crisis should be left up to the participants to solve.\n\n\u201cThe four countries that are part of that \u2013 we believe it\u2019s a family issue and that they should work [it] out,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cIf we can help facilitate those discussions then so be it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to, and should work [it] out for themselves.\u201d\n\nSpicer\u2019s remark reminded Ali al-Ahmed, director of the Institute for Gulf Affairs in Washington, of the George H.W. Bush administration\u2019s ambassador to Iraq, April Glaspie, telling Saddam Hussein in 1990 that the U.S. had \u201cno opinion on inter-Arab disputes, such as your border disagreement with Kuwait.\u201d Eight days later Saddam invaded Kuwait.\n\nAl-Ahmed thinks Spicer\u2019s remark is similarly a sign that Trump has given Riyadh a green light to invade Qatar. He said the elevation last week of Mohammed bin-Salman to Saudi Crown Prince is another ominous sign. Bin-Salman, who has shown his aggressiveness as defense minister with a two-year, open-ended disastrous attack on neighboring Yemen, replaced Muhammad bin Nayef, who was \u201cseen as too close to Qatar, and had to be pushed out,\u201d al-Ahmed told me.\n\nBin-Salman will want to consolidate his power in his new position the way he did when he was named defense minister, by launching a war, al-Ahmed said. He drew another parallel with Saddam Hussein who invaded Iran a year after he came to power to shore up his authority, with U.S. support that time too.\n\nThe stalemated war in Yemen has drained the Saudi treasury. So there is also the matter of seizing control of Qatar\u2019s supply of natural gas, the world\u2019s third largest, through a puppet regime that Riyadh would seek to install in Doha, al-Ahmed said.\n\nFearing a Larger Conflict\n\nGiven the dangers involved, instead of staying out of it, the White House should send an unequivocal message, al-Ahmed said.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. should make clear that the use of violence against another nation is not acceptable and will have consequences,\u201d he said. With the leverage Washington has, \u201cI think if the U.S. really wanted this resolved, it can achieve it easily.\u201d\n\nGiorgio Cafiero, chief executive of Gulf State Analytics in Washington, told me that the U.S. should benefit by resolving the Gulf crisis.\n\n\u201cUnquestionably, it serves Washington\u2019s interests to see its Sunni Arab allies maintain a semblance of unity and cohesion, thus this rift represents a major problem for the U.S. and its foreign policy in the Gulf region,\u201d Cafiero said.\n\nWith the U.S. largely butting out, Kuwait has been leading an effort for the Gulf Cooperation Council to solve the crisis without outside help. With its \u201cmixed messages\u201d on the crisis, Washington \u201cappears to be in a relatively weak position to facilitate a restoration of diplomatic and economic relations between the involved states,\u201d Cafiero said.\n\nAnd that could only spell danger. \u201cThe longer this stalemate prolongs, the more politically costly it will be for either side to back down,\u201d Cafiero said. \u201cIn the event that Saudi Arabia and the UAE\u2019s pressure on Qatar fails to achieve Riyadh and Abu Dhabi\u2019s goals, there are risks of escalating tensions.\u201d\n\n\u201cA military confrontation cannot be dismissed as a possible outcome of diplomatic failures to resolve the row, \u201d Cafiero said. But that may indeed be what Trump wants and why he seems to want no part in solving the crisis.\n\nIf Trump wanted the U.S. to act like a Great Power he would go even a step further to use American leverage to force an accommodation between the Saudis and the Iranians. Their rivalry has impacted conflicts in Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Bahrain, Afghanistan and now Qatar too.\n\nIn May, bin-Salman threatened to directly attack Iran and Iran returned the threat. The Saudis and Iranians blame each other as aggressors. But neither is going anywhere. A balance of power is needed to bring stability to the region.\n\nInstead of facilitating this, Trump is lowering the U.S. to the level of the sectarian combatants, openly siding with Sunni Riyadh while threatening Iran, thus risking an even larger regional war. A U.S. green light to invade Qatar could well be the prelude to an attack on Iran.\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani told the Qatari emir in a phone call on Sunday that \u201cTehran will stand by Qatar\u2019s government\u201d and that the \u201csiege of Qatar is not acceptable for us,\u201d said the website of Rouhani\u2019s office. \u201cIran\u2019s air space, ground and sea will be always be open to Qatar as a \u2026 friendly nation,\u201d said Rouhani, adding that \u201cpressure, threats and sanctions\u201d are not the way to resolve the crisis.\n\nIf the Saudis do indeed invade Qatar, al-Ahmed believes U.S. troops stationed in Qatar would secure infrastructure in Doha but would otherwise not stand in the way. Doha might not be able to rely on a contingent of Turkish forces that have been rushed to Qatar, he said, because the Turkish troops deployed do not have the heavy weapons needed to repel an invasion. The Qatar military can succeed in defending its country only if the population fights with them, said al-Ahmed.\n\n\u201cThe Qataris should start arming every man now,\u201d he said.\n\nJoe Lauria is a veteran foreign-affairs journalist.

Sometimes you even hear that Russia-gate is \u201cbigger than Watergate.\u201d\n\nYet what is perhaps most remarkable about those two Twentieth Century scandals is how little Official Washington really understands them \u2013 and how these earlier scandals significantly contrast, rather than compare, with what is unfolding now.\n\nAlthough the historical record is still incomplete on Watergate and Iran-Contra, the available evidence indicates that both scandals originated in schemes by Republicans to draw foreign leaders into plots to undermine sitting Democratic presidents and thus pave the way for the elections of Richard Nixon in 1968 and Ronald Reagan in 1980.\n\nAs for Russia-gate, even if you accept that the Russian government hacked into Democratic emails and publicized them via WikiLeaks, there is still no evidence that Donald Trump or his campaign colluded with the Kremlin to do so. By contrast, in the origins of Watergate and Iran-Contra, it appears the Nixon and Reagan campaigns, respectively, were the instigators of schemes to enlist foreign governments in blocking a Vietnam peace deal in 1968 and negotiations to free 52 American hostages in Iran in 1980.\n\nThough Watergate is associated directly with the 1972 campaign \u2013 when Nixon\u2019s team of burglars was caught inside the Democratic National Committee offices in the Watergate building \u2013 Nixon\u2019s formation of that team, known as the Plumbers, was driven by his fear that he could be exposed for sabotaging President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Vietnam peace talks in 1968 in order to secure the White House that year.\n\nAfter Nixon\u2019s narrow victory over Vice President Hubert Humphrey in the 1968 election, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover informed Nixon that Johnson had a secret file, complete with wiretapped phone calls, detailing the Nixon campaign\u2019s backchannel messages to South Vietnamese officials convincing them to boycott Johnson\u2019s Paris peace talks. Later, Nixon learned that this incriminating file had disappeared from the White House.\n\nSo, in 1971, after the leaking of the Pentagon Papers, which recounted the lies that had been used to justify the Vietnam War through 1967, Nixon fretted that the missing file about his peace-talk gambit in 1968 might surface, too, and would destroy him politically. Thus, he organized the Plumbers to find the file, even contemplating fire-bombing the Brookings Institution to enable a search of its safe where some aides thought the missing file might be found.\n\nIn other words, Watergate wasn\u2019t simply a break-in at the Democratic National Committee on June 17, 1972, in pursuit of useful political intelligence and Nixon\u2019s ensuing cover-up; the scandal had its origins in a far worse scandal, the derailing of peace talks that could have ended the Vietnam War years earlier and saved the lives of tens of thousands of U.S. soldiers and possibly more than 1 million Vietnamese.\n\nIran-Contra Parallels\n\nSimilarly, the Iran-Contra scandal exploded in 1986 with revelations that President Reagan had authorized secret arms sales to Iran with some of the profits going to fund the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, but the evidence now indicates that the connections between Reagan\u2019s team and Iran\u2019s revolutionary regime traced back to 1980 when emissaries from Reagan\u2019s campaign worked to stymie President Jimmy Carter\u2019s negotiations to free 52 American hostages then held in Iran.\n\nAccording to multiple witnesses, including former Assistant Secretary of State for Middle Eastern Affairs Nicholas Veliotes, the pre-election contacts led to the opening of a weapons pipeline to Iran (via Israel), after Reagan was sworn in on Jan. 20, 1981, which was the precise moment when Iran finally released the American hostages after 444 days.\n\nSome key players in the 1980 Reagan-Iran contacts reappeared four years later at the start of direct (again secret) U.S. arms shipments to Iran in 1985, which also involved Israeli middlemen. These key players included Iranian CIA operative Cyrus Hashemi, former CIA clandestine services chief Theodore Shackley, Reagan\u2019s campaign chief and then-CIA Director William Casey, and former CIA Director and then-Vice President George H.W. Bush.\n\nIn other words, the Iran-Contra weapons shipments of 1985-86 appear to have been an outgrowth of the earlier shipments dating back to 1980 and continuing under Israeli auspices until the supply line was taken over more directly by the Reagan administration in 1985-86.\n\nThus, both the Watergate scandal in 1972 and the Iran-Contra Affair in 1986 could be viewed as \u201csequels\u201d to the earlier machinations driven by Republican hunger to seize the enormous powers of the U.S. presidency. However, for decades, Official Washington has been hostile to these underlying explanations of how Watergate and Iran-Contra began.\n\nFor instance, The New York Times, the so-called \u201cnewspaper of record,\u201d treated the accumulation of evidence regarding Nixon\u2019s 1968 peace-talk gambit as nothing more than a \u201crumor\u201d until earlier this year when a scholar, John A. Farrell, uncovered cryptic notes taken by Nixon\u2019s aide H.R. Haldeman, which added another piece to the mosaic and left the Times little choice but to pronounce the historical reality finally real.\n\nGrasping the Watergate Narrative\n\nStill, the Times and other major news outlets have failed to factor this belated admission into the larger Watergate narrative. If you understand that Nixon did sabotage President Johnson\u2019s Vietnam War peace talks and that Nixon was aware that Johnson\u2019s file on what LBJ called Nixon\u2019s \u201ctreason\u201d had disappeared from the White House, the early \u201cWatergate tapes\u201d from 1971 suddenly make sense.\n\nNixon ordered White House chief of staff H.R. \u201cBob\u201d Haldeman and National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger to locate the missing file but their search came up empty. Yet, some Nixon aides thought the file might be hidden at the Brookings Institution, a liberal think tank in Washington. So, in his desperate pursuit of the file, Nixon called for a break-in at Brookings, possibly even fire-bombing the building as a cover for his team of burglars to slip in amid the confusion and rifle the safe.\n\nThe old explanation that Nixon simply wanted to find some file related to Johnson\u2019s 1968 pre-election Vietnam bombing halt never made sense given the extreme steps that Nixon was prepared to take.\n\nThe relevant portions of Nixon\u2019s White House tapes include an entry on June 17, 1971, coincidentally one year to the day before the Watergate burglars were caught. Nixon summoned Haldeman and Kissinger to the Oval Office and pleaded with them again to locate the file.\n\n\u201cDo we have it?\u201d Nixon asked Haldeman. \u201cI\u2019ve asked for it. You said you didn\u2019t have it.\u201d\n\nHaldeman: \u201cWe can\u2019t find it.\u201d\n\nKissinger: \u201cWe have nothing here, Mr. President.\u201d\n\nNixon: \u201cWell, damn-it, I asked for that because I need it.\u201d\n\nKissinger: \u201cBut Bob and I have been trying to put the damn thing together.\u201d\n\nHaldeman: \u201cWe have a basic history in constructing our own, but there is a file on it.\u201d\n\nNixon: \u201cWhere?\u201d\n\nHaldeman: \u201c[Presidential aide Tom Charles] Huston swears to God that there\u2019s a file on it and it\u2019s at Brookings.\u201d\n\nNixon: \u201cBob? Bob? Now do you remember Huston\u2019s plan [for White House-sponsored break-ins as part of domestic counter-intelligence operations]? Implement it.\u201d\n\nKissinger: \u201cNow Brookings has no right to have classified documents.\u201d\n\nNixon: \u201cI want it implemented. Goddamn-it, get in and get those files. Blow the safe and get it.\u201d\n\nHaldeman: \u201cThey may very well have cleaned them by now, but this thing, you need to \u201c\n\nKissinger: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Brookings had the files.\u201d\n\nHaldeman: \u201cMy point is Johnson knows that those files are around. He doesn\u2019t know for sure that we don\u2019t have them around.\u201d\n\nBut Johnson did know that the file was no longer at the White House because he had ordered his national security adviser, Walt Rostow, to remove it in the final days of Johnson\u2019s presidency.\n\nForming the Burglars\n\nOn June 30, 1971, Nixon again berated Haldeman about the need to break into Brookings and \u201ctake it [the file] out.\u201d Nixon suggested using former CIA officer E. Howard Hunt to conduct the Brookings break-in.\n\n\u201cYou talk to Hunt,\u201d Nixon told Haldeman. \u201cI want the break-in. Hell, they do that. You\u2019re to break into the place, rifle the files, and bring them in. Just go in and take it. Go in around 8:00 or 9:00 o\u2019clock.\u201d\n\nHaldeman: \u201cMake an inspection of the safe.\u201d\n\nNixon: \u201cThat\u2019s right. You go in to inspect the safe. I mean, clean it up.\u201d\n\nFor reasons that remain unclear, it appears that the Brookings break-in never took place (nor did the fire-bombing), but Nixon\u2019s desperation to locate Johnson\u2019s peace-talk file was an important link in the chain of events that led to the creation of Nixon\u2019s burglary unit under Hunt\u2019s supervision. Hunt later oversaw the two Watergate break-ins in May and June of 1972.\n\nWhile it\u2019s possible that Nixon was still searching for the file about his Vietnam-peace sabotage when the ill-fated Watergate break-ins occurred a year later, it\u2019s generally believed that the burglary was more broadly focused, seeking any information that might have an impact on Nixon\u2019s re-election, either defensively or offensively.\n\nHowever, if you think back on 1971 when the Vietnam War was tearing the country apart and massive antiwar demonstrations were descending on Washington, Nixon\u2019s desperation to locate the missing file suddenly doesn\u2019t seem quite so crazy. There would have been hell to pay if the public learned that Nixon had kept the war going to gain a political advantage in 1968.\n\nThrough 1972 \u2013 and the early days of the Watergate scandal \u2013 former President Johnson had stayed silent about Nixon\u2019s sabotage of the Paris peace talks. But the ex-President became livid when \u2013 after Nixon\u2019s reelection in 1972 \u2013 Nixon\u2019s men sought to pressure Johnson into helping them shut down the Watergate investigation, in part, by noting that Johnson, too, had deployed wiretaps against Nixon\u2019s 1968 campaign to obtain evidence about the peace-talk sabotage.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not clear whether Johnson would have finally spoken out, that threat to Nixon ended two days after Nixon\u2019s second inaugural when on Jan. 22, 1973, Johnson died of a heart attack. However, unbeknownst to Nixon, Johnson had left the missing file, called \u201cThe X-Envelope,\u201d in the care of Rostow, who \u2013 after Johnson\u2019s death \u2013 gave the file to the LBJ presidential library in Austin, Texas, with instructions that it be kept under wraps for at least 50 years. (Rostow\u2019s instructions were overturned in the 1990s, and I found the now largely declassified file at the library in 2012.)\n\nSo, with the \u201cThe X-Envelope\u201d squirreled away for more than two decades at the LBJ library and with the big newspapers treating the early sketchy reports of Nixon\u2019s peace-talk sabotage as only \u201crumors,\u201d Watergate remained a scandal limited to the 1972 campaign.\n\nStill, Nixon\u2019s cover-up of his campaign\u2019s role in the Watergate break-in produced enough clear-cut evidence of obstruction of justice and other offenses that Nixon was forced to resign on Aug. 9, 1974.\n\nA Failed Investigation\n\nThe 1979-81 hostage confrontation with Iran was not nearly as devastating a crisis as the Vietnam War but America\u2019s humiliation during the 444-day-long ordeal became a focus of the 1980 election, too, with the first anniversary of Iran\u2019s seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran coincidentally falling on Election Day 1980.\n\nPresident Carter\u2019s failure to gain freedom for the 52 embassy personnel turned what had been a close race into a landslide for Ronald Reagan, with Republicans also gaining control of the U.S. Senate and ousting some of the most influential Democratic senators.\n\nIn 1984, Reagan won reelection in another landslide, but two years later ran afoul of the Iran-Contra scandal. Reagan\u2019s secret arms sales to Iran and diversion of profits to the Contras \u201cbroke\u201d in November 1986 but focused only on Reagan\u2019s 1985-1986 arms sales and the diversion. Still, the scandal\u2019s crimes included violations of the Arms Export Control Act and the so-called Boland Act\u2019s prohibitions on arming the Contras as well as perjury and obstruction of justice. So there was the prospect of Reagan\u2019s impeachment.\n\nBut \u2013 from the start of Iran-Contra \u2013 there was a strong pushback from Republicans who didn\u2019t want to see another GOP president driven from office. There was also resistance to the scandal from many mainstream media executives who personally liked Reagan and feared a public backlash if the press played an aggressive role similar to Watergate.\n\nAnd, moderate Democrats, such as Rep. Lee Hamilton of Indiana who co-chaired the congressional investigation, sought to tamp down the Iran-Contra fires and set up firebreaks to prevent the investigation from spreading to related crimes such as the Reagan administration\u2019s protection of Contra cocaine traffickers.\n\n\u201cAsk about the cocaine,\u201d pleaded one protester who was dragged from the Iran-Contra hearing room, as the congressional investigators averted their eyes from such unseemly matters, focusing instead on stilted lectures about the Congress\u2019s constitutional prerogatives.\n\nIt was not until 1990-91 that it became clear that secret U.S.-approved arms shipments to Iran did not start in 1985 as the Iran-Contra narrative claimed but traced back to 1981 with Reagan\u2019s approval of arms sales to Iran through Israel.\n\nReagan\u2019s politically risky move of secretly arming Iran immediately after his inauguration and the hostage release was nearly exposed when one of the Israeli flights strayed into Soviet airspace on July 18, 1981, and crashed or was shot down.\n\nIn a PBS interview nearly a decade later, Nicholas Veliotes, Reagan\u2019s assistant secretary of state for the Middle East, said he looked into the incident by talking to top administration officials.\n\n\u201cIt was clear to me after my conversations with people on high that indeed we had agreed that the Israelis could transship to Iran some American-origin military equipment,\u201d Veliotes said.\n\nIn checking out the Israeli flight, Veliotes came to believe that the Reagan camp\u2019s dealings with Iran dated back to before the 1980 election. \u201cIt seems to have started in earnest in the period probably prior to the election of 1980, as the Israelis had identified who would become the new players in the national security area in the Reagan administration,\u201d Veliotes said. \u201cAnd I understand some contacts were made at that time.\u201d\n\nHowever, in 1981, Veliotes said, the State Department issued misleading press guidance to cover the administration\u2019s tracks and the Washington media failed to follow up. Thus, the U.S.-Israeli arms pipeline to Iran stayed secret from the American people until November 1986 when \u2014 despite Reagan\u2019s long-running insistence that he would never trade arms with a terrorist state like Iran \u2014 the operation was exposed.\n\nWhen I re-interviewed Veliotes in 2012, he said he couldn\u2019t recall who the \u201cpeople on high\u201d were who had described the informal clearance of the Israeli shipments of U.S.-manufactured weapons, but he indicated that \u201cthe new players\u201d were the young neoconservatives who were working on the Reagan campaign, many of whom later joined the administration as senior political appointees.\n\nDocuments that I discovered at the Reagan presidential library revealed that Reagan\u2019s neocons at the State Department, particularly Robert McFarlane and Paul Wolfowitz, initiated a policy review in 1981 to allow Israel to undertake secret military shipments to Iran.\n\nMcFarlane and Wolfowitz also maneuvered to put McFarlane in charge of U.S. relations toward Iran and to establish a clandestine U.S. back-channel to the Israeli government outside the knowledge of even senior U.S. government officials.\n\nAnother Failed Investigation\n\nIn 1991, faced with the accumulating evidence of a prequel to the Iran-Contra scandal, Congress grudgingly agreed to take a look at these so-called \u201cOctober Surprise\u201d allegations. But Republicans, then led by President George H.W. Bush and his White House team, mounted an aggressive cover-up to \u201cspike\u201d the story.\n\nAnd, with the congressional inquiry largely in the hands again of Rep. Hamilton, the Democrats timidly folded their tent despite a growing body of evidence that the Reagan team was indeed guilty.\n\nMuch of that evidence flowed into the House Task Force in December 1992 when President George H.W. Bush had already been defeated for reelection and the Democrats were looking forward to their renewed control of Washington. So, instead of giving a careful review to the new evidence, the House Task Force ignored, disparaged or buried it.\n\nThe late-arriving material included sworn testimony on Dec. 18, 1992, from David Andelman, the biographer of French intelligence chief Alexandre deMarenches, describing how deMarenches had confided that he had helped arrange the Republican-Iranian contacts. Andelman, an ex-New York Times and CBS News correspondent, said that while he was working on deMarenches\u2019s autobiography, the arch-conservative spymaster admitted arranging meetings between Republicans and Iranians about the hostage issue in the summer and fall of 1980, with one meeting held in Paris in October.\n\nAndelman said deMarenches ordered that the secret meetings be kept out of his memoirs because the story could otherwise damage the reputations of his friends, William Casey and George H.W. Bush. Andelman\u2019s testimony corroborated longstanding claims from a variety of international intelligence operatives about a Paris meeting involving Casey and Bush. But the Task Force report brushed this testimony aside, paradoxically terming it \u201ccredible\u201d but then claiming it was \u201cinsufficiently probative.\u201d\n\nThe Task Force\u2019s report argued that Andelman could not \u201crule out the possibility that deMarenches had told him he was aware of and involved in the Casey meetings because he, deMarenches, could not risk telling his biographer he had no knowledge of these allegations.\u201d\n\nIn the last weeks of the investigation, the House investigators also received a letter from former Iranian President Bani-Sadr detailing his behind-the-scenes struggle with Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and his son Ahmad over their secret dealings with the Reagan campaign. But the House investigators dismissed Bani-Sadr\u2019s first-hand account as hearsay and thus also lacking \u201cprobative value.\u201d\n\nI later unearthed some of the evidence in unpublished Task Force files. However, in the meantime, Official Washington had dismissed the \u201cOctober Surprise\u201d and other Iran-Contra-connected scandals, like Contra drug trafficking, as conspiracy theories.\n\nThe Russian Report\n\nIronically, another piece of late-arriving evidence was a January 1993 report from a national security committee of the Russian parliament about the Kremlin\u2019s intelligence data confirming that key Republicans, including George H.W. Bush and William Casey, had met with Iranian officials in Europe regarding the hostages during the 1980 campaign.\n\nHamilton had requested the Russian assistance before the U.S. election in 1992, but the report was not sent until there were only two weeks left in George H.W. Bush\u2019s presidency.\n\nLawrence Barcella, who served as the Task Force chief counsel, later told me that so much incriminating evidence arrived late that he asked Hamilton to extend the inquiry for three months but that Hamilton said no (although Hamilton told me that he had no recollection of denying Barcella\u2019s request).\n\nThe other fatal flaw of the House investigation was that it left much of the actual investigating up to President George H.W. Bush\u2019s White House counsel\u2019s office and the State Department, although Bush was one of the chief suspects and, in 1991-92, was running for re-election, a campaign that would have been derailed if the 1980 October Surprise allegations were confirmed.\n\nThe naivete of this decision was underscored years later when I located a memo at Bush\u2019s presidential library stating that the State Department had informed the White House counsel\u2019s office that Casey had traveled to Madrid in 1980, corroborating a key October Surprise allegation.\n\nThe confirmation of Casey\u2019s trip was passed along by State Department legal adviser Edwin D. Williamson to Associate White House Counsel Chester Paul Beach Jr. in early November 1991, just as the October Surprise inquiry was taking shape, according to Beach\u2019s \u201cmemorandum for record\u201d dated Nov. 4, 1991.\n\nWilliamson said that among the State Department \u201cmaterial potentially relevant to the October Surprise allegations [was] a cable from the Madrid embassy indicating that Bill Casey was in town, for purposes unknown,\u201d Beach noted.\n\nTwo days later, on Nov. 6, 1991, Beach\u2019s boss, White House counsel C. Boyden Gray, arranged an inter-agency strategy session and explained the need to contain the congressional investigation into the October Surprise case. The explicit goal was to ensure the scandal would not hurt President Bush\u2019s reelection hopes in 1992.\n\nIn 2013, when I interviewed Hamilton about the Beach memo, he lamented that the Madrid information had not been shared with his investigation, saying \u201cyou have to rely on people\u201d in authority to comply with information requests.\n\n\u201cWe found no evidence to confirm Casey\u2019s trip to Madrid,\u201d Hamilton told me. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t show that. The [George H.W. Bush] White House did not notify us that he did make the trip. Should they have passed that on to us? They should have because they knew we were interested in that.\u201d\n\nAsked if knowledge that Casey had traveled to Madrid might have changed the Task Force\u2019s dismissive October Surprise conclusion, Hamilton said yes, because the question of the Madrid trip was key to the task force\u2019s investigation.\n\nNot Moving the Needle\n\nHowever, the Madrid trip revelation and other post-investigation disclosures failed to move the needle on Official Washington\u2019s disdain for the October Surprise story.\n\nThe later disclosures included a 1993 interview in Tel Aviv in which former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said he had read the 1991 book, October Surprise, by Carter\u2019s former National Security Council aide Gary Sick, which made the case for believing that the Republicans had intervened in the 1980 hostage negotiations to disrupt Carter\u2019s reelection.\n\nWith the topic raised, one interviewer asked, \u201cWhat do you think? Was there an October Surprise?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, it was,\u201d Shamir responded without hesitation. \u201cIt was.\u201d\n\nAnd, there were other corroborating statements as well. In 1996, for instance, while former President Carter was meeting with Palestine Liberation Organization leader Arafat in Gaza City, Arafat tried to confess his role in the Republican maneuvering to block Carter\u2019s Iran-hostage negotiations.\n\n\u201cThere is something I want to tell you,\u201d Arafat said, addressing Carter in the presence of historian Douglas Brinkley. \u201cYou should know that in 1980 the Republicans approached me with an arms deal [for the PLO] if I could arrange to keep the hostages in Iran until after the [U.S. presidential] election,\u201d Arafat said, according to Brinkley\u2019s article in the fall 1996 issue of Diplomatic Quarterly.\n\nIn 2013, after the movie \u201cArgo\u201d appeared regarding an early facet of the Iran-hostage crisis, former Iranian President Bani-Sadr elaborated on his account of Republican overtures to Iran in 1980 and how that secret initiative prevented release of the hostages.\n\nIn a Christian Science Monitor commentary, Bani-Sadr wrote, \u201cAyatollah Khomeini and Ronald Reagan had organized a clandestine negotiation which prevented the attempts by myself and then-U.S. President Jimmy Carter to free the hostages before the 1980 U.S. presidential election took place. The fact that they were not released tipped the results of the election in favor of Reagan.\u201d\n\nThen, Bani-Sadr added a new detail, that \u201ctwo of my advisors, Hussein Navab Safavi and Sadr-al-Hefazi, were executed by Khomeini\u2019s regime because they had become aware of this secret relationship between Khomeini, his son Ahmad, \u2026 and the Reagan administration.\u201d [For more details on the October Surprise case, see Robert Parry\u2019s Trick or Treason and America\u2019s Stolen Narrative.]\n\nCompare and Contrast\n\nSo how do Watergate and Iran-Contra compare and contrast with Russia-gate? One key difference is that in Watergate in 1972-73 and Iran-Contra in 1985-86, you had clear-cut crimes (even if you don\u2019t want to believe the two \u201cprequels\u201d from 1968 and 1980, respectively).\n\nIn Watergate, five burglars were caught inside the DNC offices on June 17, 1972, as they sought to plant more bugs on Democratic phones. (An earlier break-in in May had installed two bugs, but one didn\u2019t work.) Nixon then proceeded to mount a cover-up of his 1972 campaign\u2019s role in funding the break-in and other abuses of power.\n\nIn Iran-Contra, Reagan secretly authorized weapons sales to Iran, which was then designated a terrorist state, without informing Congress, a violation of the Arms Export Control Act. He also kept Congress in the dark about his belated signing of a related intelligence \u201cfinding.\u201d And the creation of slush funds to finance the Nicaraguan Contras represented an evasion of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThere was also the attendant Iran-Contra cover-up mounted both by the Reagan White House and later the George H.W. Bush White House, which culminated in Bush\u2019s Christmas Eve 1992 pardons of six Iran-Contra defendants as special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh was zeroing in on possible indictment of Bush for withholding evidence.\n\nBy contrast, Russia-gate has been a \u201cscandal\u201d in search of a specific crime. President Barack Obama\u2019s intelligence chieftains have alleged \u2013 without presenting any clear evidence \u2013 that the Russian government hacked into the emails of the Democratic National Committee and of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman John Podesta and released those emails via WikiLeaks and other Internet sites. (The Russians and WikiLeaks have both denied the accusations.)\n\nThe DNC emails revealed that senior Democrats did not maintain their required independence regarding the primaries by seeking to hurt Sen. Bernie Sanders and help Clinton. The Podesta emails pulled back the curtain on Clinton\u2019s paid speeches to Wall Street banks and on pay-to-play features of the Clinton Foundation.\n\nHacking into personal computers is a crime, but the U.S. government has yet to bring any formal charges against specific individuals supposedly responsible for the hacking of the Democratic emails. There also has been no evidence that Donald Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Russians in the hacking.\n\nLacking any precise evidence of this cyber-crime or of a conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign, Obama\u2019s Justice Department holdovers and now special prosecutor Robert Mueller have sought to build \u201cprocess crimes,\u201d around false statements to investigators and possible obstruction of justice.\n\nRailroading Flynn\n\nIn the case of retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, acting Attorney General Sally Yates used the archaic Logan Act of 1799 to create a predicate for the FBI to interrogate Flynn about a Dec. 29, 2016 conversation with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, i.e., after Trump\u2019s election but before the Inauguration.\n\nThe Logan Act, which has never resulted in a prosecution in 218 years, was enacted during the period of the Alien and Sedition Acts to bar private citizens from negotiating on their own with foreign governments. It was never intended to apply to a national security adviser of an elected President, albeit before he was sworn in.\n\nBut it became the predicate for the FBI interrogation \u2014 and the FBI agents were armed with a transcript of the intercepted Kislyak-Flynn phone call so they could catch Flynn on any gaps in his recollection, which might have been made even hazier because he was on vacation in the Dominican Republic when Kislyak called.\n\nYates also concocted a bizarre argument that the discrepancies between Flynn\u2019s account of the call and the transcript left him open to Russian blackmail although how that would work \u2013 since the Russians surely assumed that Kislyak\u2019s calls would be monitored by U.S. intelligence and thus offered them no leverage with Flynn \u2013 was never explained.\n\nStill, Flynn\u2019s failure to recount the phone call precisely and the controversy stirred up around it became the basis for an obstruction of justice investigation of Flynn and led to President Trump\u2019s firing Flynn on Feb. 13.\n\nTrump may have thought that tossing Flynn overboard to the circling sharks would calm down the sharks but the blood in the water only excited them more. According to then-FBI Director James Comey, Trump talked to him one-on-one the next day, Feb. 14, and said, \u201c\u2018I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201chope\u201d and the fact that he later fired Comey have reportedly led special prosecutor Mueller to look at a possible obstruction of justice case against Trump. In other words, Trump could be accused of obstructing what appears to have been a trumped-up case against Flynn.\n\nOf course, there remains the possibility that evidence might surface of Trump or his campaign colluding with the Russians, but such evidence has so far not been presented. Or Mueller\u2019s investigation might turn over some rock and reveal some unrelated crime, possibly financial wrongdoing by Trump or an associate.\n\n(Something similar happened in the Republican investigation of the Sept. 11, 2012 Benghazi attack, a largely fruitless inquiry except that it revealed that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sent and received official emails over a private server, which Comey decried during last year\u2019s campaign as \u201cextremely careless\u201d but not criminal.)\n\nCurb the Enthusiasm\n\nAnother contrast between the earlier scandals (Watergate and Iran-Contra) and Russia-gate is the degree of enthusiasm and excitement that the U.S. mainstream media and congressional Democrats have shown today as opposed to 1972 and 1986.\n\nThough The Washington Post\u2019s Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein aggressively pursued the Watergate scandal, there was much less interest elsewhere in major news outlets until Nixon\u2019s criminality became obvious in 1973. Many national Democrats, including DNC Chairman Bob Strauss, were extremely hesitant to pursue the scandal if not outright against it.\n\nSimilarly, although Brian Barger and I at The Associated Press were pursuing aspects of Iran-Contra since early 1985, the big newspapers and networks consistently gave the Reagan administration the benefit of the doubt \u2013 at least before the scandal finally burst into view in fall 1986 (when a Contra-supply plane crashed inside Nicaragua and a Lebanese newspaper revealed U.S. arms shipments to Iran).\n\nFor several months, there was a flurry of attention to the complex Iran-Contra scandal, but the big media still ignored evidence of a White House cover-up and soon lost interest in the difficult work of unraveling the convoluted networks for arms smuggling, money laundering and cocaine trafficking.\n\nCongressional Democrats also shied away from a constitutional confrontation with the popular Reagan and his well-connected Vice President George H.W. Bush.\n\nAfter moving from AP to Newsweek in early 1987, I learned that the senior executives at Newsweek, then part of The Washington Post Company, didn\u2019t want \u201canother Watergate\u201d; they felt another such scandal was not \u201cgood for the country\u201d and wanted Iran-Contra to go away as soon as possible. I was even told not to read the congressional Iran-Contra report when it was published in October 1987 (although I ignored that order and kept trying to keep my own investigation going in defiance of the wishes of the Newsweek brass until those repeated clashes led to my departure in June 1990).\n\nSo, perhaps the biggest similarity between Russia-gate and Watergate is that Richard Nixon and Donald Trump were both highly unpopular with the Washington establishment and thus had few influential defenders, while an important contrast with Iran-Contra was that Reagan and Bush were very well liked, especially among news executives such as Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham who, by all accounts, did not care for the uncouth Nixon. Today, the senior executives of The New York Times, The Washington Post and other major news outlets have made no secret of their disdain for the buffoonish Trump and their hostility toward Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn other words, what is driving Russia-gate \u2013 for both the mainstream news media and the Democrats \u2013 appears to be a political agenda, i.e., the desire to remove Trump from office while also ratcheting up a New Cold War with Russia, a priority for Washington\u2019s neoconservatives and their liberal-interventionist sidekicks.\n\nIf this political drama were playing out in some other country, we would be talking about a \u201csoft coup\u201d in which the \u201coligarchy\u201d or some other \u201cdeep state\u201d force was using semi-constitutional means to engineer a disfavored leader\u2019s removal.\n\nOf course, since the ongoing campaign to remove Trump is happening in the United States, it must be presented as a principled pursuit of truth and a righteous application of the rule of law. But the comparisons to Watergate and Iran-Contra are a stretch.\n\nInvestigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s.

The threat has grown after the cruise missile attack on Syria in retaliation for what you claimed was a \u201cchemical weapons attack\u201d on April 4 on Syrian civilians in southern Idlib Province.\n\n2 \u2013 Our U.S. Army contacts in the area have told us this is not what happened. There was no Syrian \u201cchemical weapons attack.\u201d Instead, a Syrian aircraft bombed an al-Qaeda-in-Syria ammunition depot that turned out to be full of noxious chemicals and a strong wind blew the chemical-laden cloud over a nearby village where many consequently died.\n\n3 \u2013 This is what the Russians and Syrians have been saying and \u2013 more important \u2013what they appear to believe happened.\n\n4 \u2013 Do we conclude that the White House has been giving our generals dictation; that they are mouthing what they have been told to say?\n\n5 \u2013 After Putin persuaded Assad in 2013 to give up his chemical weapons, the U.S. Army destroyed 600 metric tons of Syria\u2019s CW stockpile in just six weeks. The mandate of the U.N.\u2019s Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW-UN) was to ensure that all were destroyed \u2013 like the mandate for the U.N. inspectors for Iraq regarding WMD. The U.N. inspectors\u2019 findings on WMD were the truth. Rumsfeld and his generals lied and this seems to be happening again. The stakes are even higher now; the importance of a relationship of trust with Russia\u2019s leaders cannot be overstated.\n\n6 \u2013 In September 2013, after Putin persuaded Assad to relinquish his chemical weapons (giving Obama a way out of a tough dilemma), the Russian President wrote an op-ed for the New York Times in which he said: \u201cMy working and personal relationship with President Obama is marked by growing trust. I appreciate this.\u201d\n\nD\u00e9tente Nipped in the Bud\n\n7 \u2013 Three-plus years later, on April 4, 2017, Russian Prime Minister Medvedev spoke of \u201cabsolute mistrust,\u201d which he characterized as \u201csad for our now completely ruined relations [but] good news for terrorists.\u201d Not only sad, in our view, but totally unnecessary \u2013 worse still, dangerous.\n\n8 \u2013 With Moscow\u2019s cancellation of the agreement to de-conflict flight activity over Syria, the clock has been turned back six months to the situation last September/October when 11 months of tough negotiation brought a ceasefire agreement. U.S. Air Force attacks on fixed Syrian army positions on Sept. 17, 2016, killing about 70 and wounding another 100, scuttled the fledgling ceasefire agreement approved by Obama and Putin a week before. Trust evaporated.\n\n9 \u2013 On Sept 26, 2016, Foreign Minister Lavrov lamented: \u201cMy good friend John Kerry \u2026 is under fierce criticism from the US military machine, [which] apparently does not really listen to the Commander in Chief.\u201d Lavrov criticized JCS Chairman Joseph Dunford for telling Congress that he opposed sharing intelligence with Russia on Syria, \u201cafter the [ceasefire] agreement, concluded on direct orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Barack Obama, had stipulated that the two sides would share intelligence. \u2026 It is difficult to work with such partners. \u2026\u201d\n\n10 \u2013 On Oct. 1, 2016, Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova warned, \u201cIf the US launches a direct aggression against Damascus and the Syrian Army, it would cause a terrible, tectonic shift not only in the country, but in the entire region.\u201d\n\n11 \u2013 On Oct 6, 2016, Russian defense spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov cautioned that Russia was prepared to shoot down unidentified aircraft \u2013 including any stealth aircraft \u2013 over Syria. Konashenkov made a point of adding that Russian air defenses \u201cwill not have time to identify the origin\u201d of the aircraft.\n\n12 \u2013 On Oct 27, 2016, Putin publicly lamented, \u201cMy personal agreements with the President of the United States have not produced results,\u201d and complained about \u201cpeople in Washington ready to do everything possible to prevent these agreements from being implemented in practice.\u201d Referring to Syria, Putin decried the lack of a \u201ccommon front against terrorism after such lengthy negotiations, enormous effort, and difficult compromises.\u201d\n\n13 \u2013 Thus, the unnecessarily precarious state into which U.S.-Russian relations have now sunk \u2013 from \u201cgrowing trust\u201d to \u201cabsolute mistrust.\u201d To be sure, many welcome the high tension, which \u2013 admittedly \u2013 is super for the arms business.\n\n14 \u2013 We believe it of transcendent importance to prevent relations with Russia from falling into a state of complete disrepair. Secretary Tillerson\u2019s visit to Moscow this week offers an opportunity to stanch the damage, but there is also a danger that it could increase the acrimony \u2013 particularly if Secretary Tillerson is not familiar with the brief history set down above.\n\n15 \u2013 Surely it is time to deal with Russia on the basis of facts, not allegations based largely on dubious evidence \u2013 from \u201csocial media,\u201d for example. While many would view this time of high tension as ruling out a summit, we suggest the opposite may be true. You might consider instructing Secretary Tillerson to begin arrangements for an early summit with President Putin.\n\n* Background on Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS), a list of whose issuances can be found at https://consortiumnews.com/vips-memos/.\n\nA handful of CIA veterans established VIPS in January 2003 after concluding that Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld had ordered our former colleagues to manufacture intelligence to \u201cjustify\u201d an unnecessary war with Iraq. At the time we chose to assume that President George W. Bush was not fully aware of this.\n\nWe issued our first Memorandum for the President on the afternoon of Feb. 5, 2003, after Colin Powell\u2019s ill-begotten speech at the United Nations.

But after watching Secretary Powell today, we are convinced that you would be well served if you widened the discussion \u2026 beyond the circle of those advisers clearly bent on a war for which we see no compelling reason and from which we believe the unintended consequences are likely to be catastrophic.\n\nRespectfully, we offer the same advice to you, President Trump.\n\n* * *\n\nFor the Steering Group, Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity\n\nEugene D.

For Official Washington\u2019s foreign-policy elite, Obama\u2019s flinching from a bombing campaign against Assad was a historical inflection point for which Obama deserves hearty condemnation.\n\nBut if you read far enough into this story of Obama\u2019s \u201cfeckless\u201d behavior, you encounter a curious admission from Goldberg: that U.S. intelligence was unsure whether Assad was responsible for the attack.\n\nAs Goldberg writes, \u201cObama was \u2026 unsettled by a surprise visit early in the week from James Clapper, his director of national intelligence, who interrupted the President\u2019s Daily Brief, the threat report Obama receives each morning from Clapper\u2019s analysts, to make clear that the intelligence on Syria\u2019s use of sarin gas, while robust, was not a \u2018slam dunk.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe chose the term carefully. Clapper, the chief of an intelligence community traumatized by its failures in the run-up to the Iraq War, was not going to overpromise, in the manner of the onetime CIA director George Tenet, who famously guaranteed George W. Bush a \u2018slam dunk\u2019 in Iraq.\u201d\n\nWhat I was told by intelligence sources at the time was that the evidence against Assad was anything but a slam dunk. It was not even \u201crobust,\u201d as Goldberg insists. There were serious doubts among intelligence professionals about many of the \u201ccertainties\u201d that Official Washington\u2019s neocon-dominated foreign policy establishment had quickly accepted as true about the sarin attack, blaming Assad.\n\nIn the face of that \u201cgroup think,\u201d Clapper surely did not want to go too much against the grain \u2013 he\u2019s far too timid a bureaucrat for that \u2013 but his analysts were balking at once again being pushed into justifying another hasty war.\n\nThis resistance from the U.S. intelligence community should have been easy to spot, except that the neocons were whipping Official Washington into another war stampede. They saw the sarin attack as the catalyst for another \u201cregime change,\u201d so the last thing they wanted was a sober analysis of the evidence. They wanted a \u201cgroup think\u201d to take hold and to bait a reluctant Obama into action by portraying him as a wimp if he didn\u2019t start bombing right away.\n\nRush to War\n\nThe neocon strategy almost worked. Across Official Washington and the mainstream U.S. news media, there was a classic rush to judgment. However, when Secretary of State John Kerry made a bellicose case for war on Aug. 30, 2013, and released a supporting \u201cgovernment assessment,\u201d what was most remarkable to me was that there was not a shred of verifiable evidence implicating Assad.\n\nIndeed, it made little sense that Assad would have launched a sarin attack when United Nations inspectors had just arrived in Damascus to examine suspected chemical weapons cases that Assad was blaming on jihadist rebels.\n\nThe fact that Kerry had to rely on a new confection, called a \u201cgovernment assessment\u201d prepared by political operatives rather than the traditional \u201cintelligence assessment\u201d expressing the consensus judgment of the 16 intelligence agencies, was a further tip-off that the U.S. intelligence community was not onboard. After Kerry\u2019s speech, I reported on the startling lack of evidence in the \u201cdodgy dossier.\u201d\n\nSo, on Aug. 31, 2013, when Obama began to back away from the rush to war, the President deserved praise for showing reasonable caution. After all, what sense would it make to punish the Syrian government for launching a sarin attack if, in reality, the atrocity was carried out by someone else, in this case, one of the radical jihadist groups trying to trick the U.S. government into intervening in the war on their side?\n\nIt\u2019s now clear that if Obama had launched a major bombing campaign against the Syrian military, he might have inadvertently cleared a path for Al Qaeda\u2019s Nusra Front or the Islamic State to seize control of Damascus, touching off an even more devastating human catastrophe. But \u201cregime change\u201d in Syria was a neocon obsession, even if it carried the risk of terrorist groups gaining control of a major Middle Eastern nation.\n\nIn the weeks and months after the sarin attack, the case against Assad continued to crumble. The U.N. inspectors recovered only one rocket carrying sarin and it was incapable of traveling the distance that would have indicated that it was fired by the Syrian military. Then, investigative reporter Seymour Hersh reported in 2014 that intelligence officials had traced the attack to radical jihadists in apparent collaboration with Turkish intelligence. More recently, I\u2019ve been told that U.S. intelligence now agrees with Hersh\u2019s reporting.\n\nIn other words, Clapper\u2019s recognition that there was no \u201cslam dunk\u201d case implicating Assad has been vindicated by subsequent evidence. But Official Washington\u2019s foreign-policy elite simply can\u2019t accept these findings, instead maintaining the myth that Assad flouted Obama\u2019s \u201cred line\u201d and that Obama lost his nerve and thus undermined U.S. \u201ccredibility.\u201d This myth is so beloved among neocons and their liberal-interventionist allies that it can\u2019t be surrendered regardless of its lack of evidentiary support.\n\nAfter all, admitting that another neocon \u201cgroup think\u201d was dangerously misguided \u2013 after the Iraq War WMD fiasco \u2013 might finally topple some of these self-important pundits from their endowed think-tank chairs. Americans might finally recognize that these pompous know-it-alls are really just vacuous know-nothings.\n\nSo, instead of an article praising Obama for his realism and restraint \u2013 for demanding hard evidence before launching another U.S. war in the Middle East \u2013 we get Jeffrey Goldberg\u2019s opus analyzing why Obama chickened out on the \u201cred line\u201d and how that failure has impaired U.S. foreign policy.", "domain": "consortiumnews.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://consortiumnews.com/2016/03/10/neocons-red-faced-over-red-line/"}

But that rush to judgment was picked apart by investigative journalist Seymour Hersh and others, as Robert Parry reported in spring 2014.\n\nBy Robert Parry (First published on April 6, 2014)\n\nIn late August 2013, the Obama administration lurched to the brink of invading Syria after blaming a Sarin gas attack outside Damascus on President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government, but evidence reported by investigative journalist Seymour M. Hersh implicates Turkish intelligence and extremist Syrian rebels instead.\n\nThe significance of Hersh\u2019s report is twofold: first, it shows how Official Washington\u2019s hawks and neocons almost stampeded the United States into another Mideast war under false pretenses, and second, the story\u2019s publication in the London Review of Books reveals how hostile the mainstream U.S. media remains toward information that doesn\u2019t comport with its neocon-dominated conventional wisdom.\n\nIn other words, it appears that Official Washington and its mainstream press have absorbed few lessons from the disastrous Iraq War, which was launched in 2003 under the false claim that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was planning to share hidden stockpiles of WMD with al-Qaeda, when there was no WMD nor any association between Hussein and al-Qaeda.\n\nA decade later in August and September 2013, as a new war hysteria broke out over Assad allegedly crossing President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cred line\u201d against using chemical weapons, it fell to a few Internet sites, including our own Consortiumnews.com, to raise questions about the administration\u2019s allegations that pinned the Aug. 21 attack on the Syrian government.\n\nNot only did the U.S. government fail to provide a single piece of verifiable evidence to support its claims, a much-touted \u201cvector analysis\u201d by Human Rights Watch and The New York Times supposedly tracing the flight paths of two rockets back to a Syrian military base northwest of Damascus collapsed when it became clear that only one rocket carried Sarin and its range was less than one-third the distance between the army base and the point of impact. That meant the rocket carrying the Sarin appeared to have originated in rebel territory.\n\nThere were other reasons to doubt the Obama administration\u2019s casus belli, including the irrationality of Assad ordering a chemical weapons strike outside Damascus just as United Nations inspectors were unpacking at a local hotel with plans to investigate an earlier attack that the Syrian government blamed on the rebels.\n\nAssad would have known that a chemical attack would have diverted the inspectors (as it did) and would force President Obama to declare that his \u201cred line\u201d had been crossed, possibly prompting a massive U.S. retaliatory strike (as it almost did).\n\nPlans for War\n\nHersh\u2019s article describes how devastating the U.S. aerial bombardment was supposed to be, seeking to destroy Assad\u2019s military capability, which, in turn, could have cleared the way to victory for the Syrian rebels, whose fortunes had been declining.\n\nHersh wrote: \u201cUnder White House pressure, the US attack plan evolved into \u2018a monster strike\u2019: two wings of B-52 bombers were shifted to airbases close to Syria, and navy submarines and ships equipped with Tomahawk missiles were deployed.\n\n\u201c\u2018Every day the target list was getting longer,\u2019 the former intelligence official told me. \u2018The Pentagon planners said we can\u2019t use only Tomahawks to strike at Syria\u2019s missile sites because their warheads are buried too far below ground, so the two B-52 air wings with two-thousand pound bombs were assigned to the mission. Then we\u2019ll need standby search-and-rescue teams to recover downed pilots and drones for target selection. It became huge.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe new target list was meant to \u2018completely eradicate any military capabilities Assad had\u2019, the former intelligence official said. The core targets included electric power grids, oil and gas depots, all known logistic and weapons depots, all known command and control facilities, and all known military and intelligence buildings.\u201d\n\nAccording to Hersh, the administration\u2019s war plans were disrupted by U.S. and British intelligence analysts who uncovered evidence that the Sarin was likely not released by the Assad government and indications that Turkey\u2019s intelligence services may have collaborated with radical rebels to deploy the Sarin as a false-flag operation.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Prime Minister Recep Erdo\u00c4\u0178an sided with the Syrian opposition early in the civil conflict and provided a vital supply line to the al-Nusra Front, a violent group of Sunni extremists with ties to al-Qaeda and increasingly the dominant rebel fighting force. By 2012, however, internecine conflicts among rebel factions had contributed to Assad\u2019s forces gaining the upper hand.\n\nThe role of Islamic radicals and the fear that advanced U.S. weapons might end up in the hands of al-Qaeda terrorists unnerved President Obama who pulled back on U.S. covert support for the rebels. That frustrated Erdo\u00c4\u0178an who pressed Obama to expand U.S. involvement, according to Hersh\u2019s account.\n\nHersh wrote: \u201cBy the end of 2012, it was believed throughout the American intelligence community that the rebels were losing the war. \u2018Erdo\u00c4\u0178an was pissed,\u2019 the former intelligence official said, \u2018and felt he was left hanging on the vine. It was his money and the [U.S] cut-off was seen as a betrayal.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2018Red Line\u2019 Worries\n\nRecognizing Obama\u2019s political sensitivity over his \u201cred line\u201d pledge, the Turkish government and Syrian rebels saw chemical weapons as the way to force the President\u2019s hand, Hersh reported, writing:\n\n\u201cIn spring 2013 US intelligence learned that the Turkish government through elements of the MIT, its national intelligence agency, and the Gendarmerie, a militarised law-enforcement organisation was working directly with al-Nusra and its allies to develop a chemical warfare capability.\n\n\u201c\u2018The MIT was running the political liaison with the rebels, and the Gendarmerie handled military logistics, on-the-scene advice and training including training in chemical warfare,\u2019 the former intelligence official said. \u2018Stepping up Turkey\u2019s role in spring 2013 was seen as the key to its problems there. Erdo\u00c4\u0178an knew that if he stopped his support of the jihadists it would be all over. The Saudis could not support the war because of logistics the distances involved and the difficulty of moving weapons and supplies. Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u2019s hope was to instigate an event that would force the US to cross the red line. But Obama didn\u2019t respond [to small chemical weapons attacks] in March and April.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe dispute between Erdo\u00c4\u0178an and Obama came to a head at a White House meeting on May 16, 2013, when Erdo\u00c4\u0178an unsuccessfully lobbied for a broader U.S. military commitment to the rebels, Hersh reported.\n\nThree months later, in the early hours of Aug. 21, 2013, a mysterious missile delivered a lethal load of Sarin into a suburb east of Damascus. The Obama administration and the mainstream U.S. press corps immediately jumped to the conclusion that the Syrian government had launched the attack, which the U.S. government claimed killed at least \u201c1,429\u201d people although the number of victims cited by doctors and other witnesses on the scene was much lower.\n\nYet, with the media stampede underway, anyone who questioned the U.S. government\u2019s case was trampled under charges of being an \u201cAssad apologist.\u201d But we few skeptics continued to point out the lack of evidence to support the rush to war. Obama also encountered political resistance in both the British Parliament and U.S. Congress, but hawks in the U.S. State Department were itching for a new war.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry delivered a bellicose speech on Aug. 30, 2013, amid expectations that the U.S. bombs would start flying within days. But Obama hesitated, first referring the war issue to Congress and later accepting a compromise brokered by Russian President Vladimir Putin to have Assad surrender all of his chemical weapons even as Assad continued denying any role in the Aug. 21 attacks.\n\nObama took the deal but continued asserting publicly that Assad was guilty and disparaging anyone who thought otherwise. In a formal address to the UN General Assembly on Sept. 24, 2013, Obama declared, \u201cIt\u2019s an insult to human reason and to the legitimacy of this institution to suggest that anyone other than the regime carried out this attack.\u201d\n\nSuspicions of Turkey\n\nHowever, by autumn 2013, U.S. intelligence analysts were among those who had joined in the \u201cinsult to human reason\u201d as their doubts about Assad\u2019s guilt grew. Hersh cited an ex-intelligence official saying: \u201cthe US intelligence analysts who kept working on the events of 21 August \u2018sensed that Syria had not done the gas attack. But the 500 pound gorilla was, how did it happen? The immediate suspect was the Turks, because they had all the pieces to make it happen.\u2019\n\n\u201cAs intercepts and other data related to the 21 August attacks were gathered, the intelligence community saw evidence to support its suspicions. \u2018We now know it was a covert action planned by Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u2019s people to push Obama over the red line,\u2019 the former intelligence official said. \u2018They had to escalate to a gas attack in or near Damascus when the UN inspectors\u2019 who arrived in Damascus on 18 August to investigate the earlier use of gas \u2018were there. The deal was to do something spectacular.\n\n\u201c\u2018Our senior military officers have been told by the DIA and other intelligence assets that the sarin was supplied through Turkey that it could only have gotten there with Turkish support. The Turks also provided the training in producing the sarin and handling it.\u2019\n\n\u201cMuch of the support for that assessment came from the Turks themselves, via intercepted conversations in the immediate aftermath of the attack. \u2018Principal evidence came from the Turkish post-attack joy and back-slapping in numerous intercepts. Operations are always so super-secret in the planning but that all flies out the window when it comes to crowing afterwards. There is no greater vulnerability than in the perpetrators claiming credit for success.\u2019\u201d\n\nAccording to the thinking of Turkish intelligence, Hersh reported, \u201cErdo\u00c4\u0178an\u2019s problems in Syria would soon be over: \u2018Off goes the gas and Obama will say red line and America is going to attack Syria, or at least that was the idea. But it did not work out that way.\u2019\u201d\n\nHersh added that the U.S. intelligence community has been reluctant to pass on to Obama the information contradicting the Assad-did-it scenario. Hersh wrote:\n\n\u201cThe post-attack intelligence on Turkey did not make its way to the White House. \u2018Nobody wants to talk about all this,\u2019 the former intelligence official told me. \u2018There is great reluctance to contradict the president, although no all-source intelligence community analysis supported his leap to convict. There has not been one single piece of additional evidence of Syrian involvement in the sarin attack produced by the White House since the bombing raid was called off. My government can\u2019t say anything because we have acted so irresponsibly. And since we blamed Assad, we can\u2019t go back and blame Erdo\u00c4\u0178an.\u2019\u201d\n\nLike the bloody U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, the near U.S. air war against Syria in 2013 is a cautionary tale for Americans regarding the dangers that result when the U.S. government and mainstream media dance off hand in hand, leaping to conclusions and laughing at doubters.\n\nThe key difference between the war in Iraq and the averted war on Syria was that President Obama was not as eager as his predecessor, George W. Bush, to dress himself up as a \u201cwar president.\u201d Another factor was that Obama had the timely assistance of Russian President Putin to chart a course that skirted the abyss.\n\nGiven how close the U.S. neocons came to maneuvering a reluctant Obama into another \u201cregime change\u201d war on a Mideast adversary of Israel, you can understand why they are so angry with Putin and why they were so eager to hit back at him in Ukraine.

Bush could have prevented the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people \u2013 and set the country on a dangerous course for revenge. FBI agent Harry Samit, who interrogated Moussaoui weeks before the Sept. 11 attacks, sent 70 warnings to his superiors about suspicions that the al-Qaeda operative had been taking flight training in Minnesota because he was planning to hijack a plane for a terrorist operation. But FBI officials in Washington showed \u201ccriminal negligence\u201d in blocking requests for a search warrant on Moussaoui\u2019s computer or taking other preventive action, Samit testified at Moussaoui\u2019s death penalty hearing on March 20. Samit\u2019s futile warnings matched the frustrations of other federal agents in Minnesota and Arizona who had gotten wind of al-Qaeda\u2019s audacious scheme to train pilots for operations in the United States. But the agents couldn\u2019t get their warnings addressed by senior officials at FBI headquarters. Another big part of the problem was the lack of urgency at the top. Bush, who had been President for half a year, was taking a month-long vacation at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, and shrugged off the growing alarm within the U.S. intelligence community. Separate from the FBI field agents, the Central Intelligence Agency was piecing the puzzle together from tips, intercepts and other scraps of information. On Aug. 6, 2001, more than a month before the attacks, the CIA had enough evidence to send Bush a top-secret Presidential Daily Briefing paper, \u201cBin Laden Determined To Strike in US.\u201d The CIA told Bush about \u201cthreat reporting\u201d that indicated bin-Laden wanted \u201cto hijack a US aircraft.\u201d The CIA also cited a call that had been made to the U.S. Embassy in the United Arab Emirates in May 2001 \u201csaying that a group of Bin Laden supporters was in the US planning attacks with explosives.\u201d \u201cThe system was blinking red\u201d during the summer of 2001, CIA Director George Tenet later told the 9/11 Commission. Bush\u2019s Justice Department and FBI headquarters were in the loop on the CIA reporting, but didn\u2019t reach out to their agents around the country, some of whom, it turned out, were frantically trying to get the attention of their superiors in Washington. Then-acting FBI Director Thomas Pickard told the 9/11 Commission that he discussed the intelligence threat reports with FBI special agents from around the country in a conference call on July 19, 2001. But Pickard said the focus was on having \u201cevidence response teams\u201d ready to respond quickly in the event of an attack. Pickard \u201cdid not task field offices to try to determine whether any plots were being considered within the United States or to take any action to disrupt any such plots,\u201d according to the 9/11 Commission\u2019s report. Contrasting Styles Amid this bureaucratic inertia, Bush\u2019s role was crucial. As President, he was the best-positioned official to force the various parts of the government to undertake a top-down review of what was known, what evidence was being missed, what could be done. Richard Clarke, who had been President Bill Clinton\u2019s counterterrorism chief and stayed in that job after Bush took office, said the Clinton administration reacted to such threats with urgent top-level meetings to \u201cshake the trees\u201d at the FBI, CIA, Customs and other relevant agencies. Clarke said senior managers would respond by going back to their agencies to demand a search for any overlooked information and to put rank-and-file personnel on high alert, as happened when an al-Qaeda plot to bomb Millennium celebrations was thwarted in 1999. \u201cIn December 1999, we received intelligence reports that there were going to be major al-Qaeda attacks,\u201d Clarke said on CNN\u2019s \u201cLarry King Live\u201d two years ago. \u201cPresident Clinton asked his national security adviser Sandy Berger to hold daily meetings with the attorney general, the FBI director, the CIA director and stop the attacks. \u201cEvery day they went back from the White House to the FBI, to the Justice Department, to the CIA and they shook the trees to find out if there was any information. You know, when you know the United States is going to be attacked, the top people in the United States government ought to be working hands-on to prevent it and working together.\n\n\n\n\u201dNow, contrast that with what happened in the summer of 2001, when we even had more clear indications that there was going to be an attack. Did the President ask for daily meetings of his team to try to stop the attack? Did (national security adviser) Condi Rice hold meetings of her counterparts to try to stop the attack? No.\u201d In a March 19, 2006, speech in Florida, former Vice President Al Gore also noted this contrast between how the Clinton administration reacted to terrorist threats and how the Bush administration did in the weeks before Sept. 11. \u201cIn eight years in the White House, President Clinton and I, a few times, got a direct and really immediate statement like that (Aug. 6, 2001 warning), in one of those daily briefings,\u201d Gore said. \u201cEvery time, as you would want and expect, we had a fire drill, brought everybody in, (asked) what else do we know about this, what have we done to prepare for this, what else could we do, are we certain of the sources, get us more information on that, we want to know everything about this, and we want to make sure our country is prepared. \u201cIn August of 2001,\u201d Gore added, \u201csuch a clear warning was given and nothing \u2013 nothing \u2013 happened. When there is no vision, the people perish.\u201d [To see Gore\u2019s speech on C-Span, click here.] Gone Fishing After receiving the CIA\u2019s Aug. 6, 2001, warning, Bush is reported to have gone fishing and cleared brush at his ranch. There is no evidence that he did anything to energize or coordinate the government response to the expected attack. \u201cNo CSG (Counterterrorism Security Group) or other NSC (National Security Council) meeting was held to discuss the possible threat of a strike in the United States as a result of this (Aug. 6) report,\u201d the 9/11 Commission wrote. \u201cWe have found no indication of any further discussion before Sept. 11 among the President and his top advisers of the possibility of a threat of an al-Qaeda attack in the United States.\u201d Talking on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on April 4, 2004, the commission\u2019s chairman and vice chairman, New Jersey\u2019s Republican former Gov. Thomas Kean and former Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., said they believed the Sept. 11 attacks were preventable. \u201cThe whole story might have been different,\u201d Kean said, citing a string of law-enforcement blunders including the \u201clack of coordination within the FBI\u201d and the FBI\u2019s failure to understand the significance of suspected hijacker Moussaoui\u2019s arrest in August 2001 while training to fly passenger jets. However, from the recent testimony at Moussaoui\u2019s sentencing hearing, it\u2019s now clear that FBI agents in Minnesota did grasp the significance of the flight training and did send alarming messages to Washington-based FBI officials responsible for counterterrorism. But those officials at headquarters apparently missed or ignored the warnings. Moussaoui\u2019s defense attorney, Edward B. McMahon Jr., asked Michael E. Rolince, who was chief of the FBI\u2019s International Terrorism Operations Section, if he was aware that FBI agent Samit had sent a memo to Rolince\u2019s office on Aug. 18, 2001, warning that Moussaoui was a potential terrorist. \u201cNo,\u201d Rolince answered. \u201cWhat document are you reading?\u201d Samit\u2019s report \u201csent to your office,\u201d McMahon replied. Rolince said he never saw the urgent memo. [Washington Post, March 22, 2006] When the 9/11 Commission interviewed Rolince for its 2004 report, Rolince \u201crecalled being told about Moussaoui in two passing hallway conversations but only in the context that he [Rolince] might be receiving telephone calls from Minneapolis complaining about how headquarters was handling the matter,\u201d though the calls never came, the report said. But Rolince was not the only senior FBI official oblivious to the missed clues. The 9/11 report said acting FBI director Pickard and assistant director for counterterrorism Dale Watson weren\u2019t briefed on Moussaoui prior to Sept. 11, either. The significance of the new information from Moussaoui\u2019s hearing \u2013 which followed his guilty plea to charges that he had conspired with al-Qaeda to commit acts of terrorism \u2013 is that there\u2019s no longer any doubt that key pieces of the puzzle were tantalizing close to the FBI officials who could have done something. FBI headquarters also blew off a prescient memo from an FBI agent in the Phoenix field office. The July 2001 memo warned of the \u201cpossibility of a coordinated effort by Usama Bin Laden\u201d to send student pilots to the United States. The agent noted \u201can inordinate number of individuals of investigative interest\u201d attending American flight schools. No action was taken on the Phoenix memo before Sept. 11. How Incompetent? Yet, if President Bush had demanded action from on high, the ripple effect through the FBI might well have jarred loose enough of the pieces to make the overall picture suddenly clear, especially in view of the information already compiled by the CIA. Ironically, that is almost the same argument that federal prosecutors are making in seeking Moussaoui\u2019s execution. It\u2019s not that he was directly involved in the Sept. 11 plot, they say; it\u2019s that the government might have been able to stop the attacks if he had immediately confessed what he was up to. To some civil libertarians, the case raises troubling Fifth Amendment issues by creating a precedent for putting someone to death who didn\u2019t promptly confess and thus didn\u2019t provide clues that might have prevented a separate murder that the defendant didn\u2019t specifically know about and wasn\u2019t directly involved in. In effect, the government is basing its demand for Moussaoui\u2019s death on the notion that the failure to do something that might have prevented the tragedy of Sept. 11 should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. However, the Bush administration has taken almost the opposite position on its own culpability. Despite a strong case for criminal negligence \u2013 beginning with FBI officials and reaching up to the Oval Office \u2013 Bush and other senior officials have insisted they have nothing to apologize for. Indeed, Bush has made his handling of the Sept. 11 terror attacks the centerpiece of his presidential legacy. Arguably, he rode the whirlwind from the attacks right through the war in Afghanistan to the invasion of Iraq to his second term as President. Only recently \u2013 after a similar case of botched leadership during the Hurricane Katrina disaster \u2013 has the air whooshed out of the Bush balloon. Add in the disastrous decisions around the Iraq War and many Americans see a pattern of arrogant, incompetent leadership that fails to give adequate heed to evidence or attention to details. For other Americans, the theory of Bush\u2019s incompetence doesn\u2019t go nearly far enough to explain the breathtaking lapses that let the Sept. 11 attacks happen. Some 9/11 skeptics have come to believe that the destruction of the Twin Towers and the damage to the Pentagon must have been an \u201cinside job\u201d with some elements of the Bush administration conspiring with the attackers to create a modern-day Reichstag Fire that would justify invading Iraq and consolidating political power at home. The new Moussaoui evidence, however, tends to support the theory of incompetence, though of a kind so gross that it would border on criminal negligence, at the FBI as well as the White House. Perceptive field agents did their job in sending up warning flares to Washington, but a vacationing President and an inattentive FBI bureaucracy failed to take note or take the necessary actions to head off the tragedy. Then, with the Twin Towers and the Pentagon still smoldering, Bush and his neoconservative advisers saw in the nation\u2019s anger and fear the emotions needed to implement an agenda of authoritarian rule at home and preemptive wars abroad.

By Robert Parry\n\nApril 4, 2006 T ucked inside an article about George W. Bush\u2019s disastrous Iraq War and his continuing failure to catch Osama bin-Laden, Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen offered a limited criticism of himself and his media colleagues who have acted as pro-Bush cheerleaders for much of the past four-plus years. \u201cThose of us who once advocated this war [in Iraq] are humbled,\u201d Cohen wrote in a column on April 4. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that we grossly underestimated the enemy. We vastly overestimated the Bush administration.\u201d Cohen castigated Bush for \u201chis embrace of incompetents, not to mention his own incompetence. \u2026 Rummy still runs the Pentagon. The only generals who have been penalized are those who spoke the truth. \u2026 Victory in Iraq is now three years or so overdue and a bit over budget. Lives have been lost for no good reason \u2013 never mind the money \u2013 and now Bush suggests that his successor may still have to keep troops in Iraq.\u201d But what is also true is that the major U.S. news media has operated with equally stunning incompetence and \u2013 just like in the U.S. government \u2013 there has been almost no accountability. The Washington Post, for instance, offers up nearly the same line-up of columnists who ran with the pro-war herd from 2002 through 2005. Some, like David Ignatius, have only slowly begun to retreat from their enthusiasm for invading Iraq; others, like Charles Krauthammer, remain true believers in the neoconservative cause. Fred Hiatt stays ensconced, too, as the editorial page editor, despite having to admit that his pre-war editorials shouldn\u2019t have treated the threat of Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass destruction as a \u201cflat fact\u201d instead of an allegation. Tactical Retreats Yet, even the tactical retreats by \u201chumbled\u201d pro-war columnists like Cohen have focused on U.S. incompetence in waging the war, not any outrage over the illegality and immorality of invading a country that wasn\u2019t threatening the United States. By failing to expand the criticism of Bush beyond success or failure, the mainstream U.S. news media implicitly embraces Bush\u2019s assertion of a special American right to attack wherever and whenever the President says. It\u2019s still out of bounds to discuss how the Iraq invasion violated the Nuremberg principle against aggressive war and the United Nations Charter, which bars attacking another country except in cases of self-defense or with the approval of the U.N. Security Council. Indeed, in the mainstream U.S. press, there\u2019s a smirking attitude whenever international law is mentioned, much like the contempt expressed by President Bush in his quip, \u201cInternational law? I better call my lawyer.\u201d To one extent or another, nearly all major U.S. news outlets have bought into the imperial neoconservative vision of an all-powerful United States that operates outside of international law. This perspective can be found among the loudmouths at Fox News as well as in the more tempered columns by Thomas Friedman of the New York Times. So, the debate over the Iraq War\u2019s legality has been limited mostly to the Internet and to the foreign press. Despite growing mainstream U.S. doubts about whether the Iraq War was \u201cworth it,\u201d there are almost no second thoughts about whether it was a war crime. Yet there is a strong argument that the United States should begin facing up to how Bush\u2019s actions violated the rules laid down by the Nuremberg Tribunals, which held that aggressive war was an offense so severe that it justified execution. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson, who represented the United States at Nuremberg, stated, too, that the principle did not only apply to Adolf Hitler\u2019s henchmen, but to all nations, including World War II\u2019s victorious powers. \u201cLet me make clear that while this law is first applied against German aggressors, the law includes, and if it is to serve a useful purpose, it must condemn aggression by any other nations, including those which sit here now in judgment,\u201d Jackson said. This failure of the U.S. press corps to address legal and moral issues raised by Bush\u2019s Iraq War also reflects a refusal by the news media to hold leading American journalists accountable for their part in the tragedy. Richard Cohen may feel \u201chumbled,\u201d but that is little comfort to the tens of thousands of Iraqis and American soldiers killed and maimed from an aggressive war that nearly all the high-priced American pundits cheered on.

By Robert Parry\n\nMarch 8, 2006 I t\u2019s hard to conceive how the United States will win a \u201cwar of ideas\u201d in the Islamic world when American leaders flock to a Washington conference where Muslims are publicly insulted and the U.S. officials fail to voice objections to the bigotry. That\u2019s what happened at this week\u2019s annual meeting of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee whose invitees included Vice President Dick Cheney, Republican National Committee Chairman Ken Mehlman, former Democratic vice presidential nominee John Edwards, Virginia\u2019s ex-Democratic Gov. Mark Warner, and Sens. Evan Bayh, D-Ind., and Susan Collins, R-Maine. In a luncheon speech on March 6, Israel\u2019s Ambassador to the United Nations Dan Gillerman entertained the AIPAC crowd with what the Washington Post described as \u201cstraight talk,\u201d including a comment that came close to equating Islam with terrorism. \u201cWhile it may be true \u2013 and probably is \u2013 that not all Muslims are terrorists, it also happens to be true that nearly all terrorists are Muslim,\u201d Gillerman said to the crowd\u2019s delight. Gillerman\u2019s comment earned him a description in a column by the Washington Post\u2019s Dana Milbank as \u201cthe undiplomatic diplomat.\u201d Milbank also observed that \u201cwords are seldom minced at the annual (AIPAC) meeting.\u201d [Washington Post, March 7, 2006] But what was perhaps more glaring was the fact that Gillerman\u2019s professed uncertainty whether \u201call Muslims are terrorists\u201d did not raise a protest, condemning it as an ugly example of anti-Muslim bigotry. It is hard to imagine a similar formulation about any other ethnic or religious group that wouldn\u2019t have erupted in controversy. Instead, U.S. officials and politicians \u2013 both Republican and Democrat \u2013 avoided criticizing Gillerman or almost anything else about AIPAC, bowing to its legendary power to make or break American political leaders. Indictments The pro-Israel lobbying group hailed the conference as a stunning success, drawing a record number of 4,500 participants despite the pending criminal case against two ex-AIPAC officials Steve Rosen and Keith Weissman, who are facing charges of illegally disseminating U.S. government secrets. As Milbank\u2019s column noted, there was a studied silence about the Rosen-Weissman case as AIPAC preferred to stay focused on Islamic terrorism and other perceived threats coming from Iran and the Palestinians. On March 7, Cheney addressed the AIPAC conference, making no reference to Gillerman\u2019s Muslim slur. Instead, Cheney urged unwavering support for the Bush administration\u2019s War on Terror and threatened Iran with \u201cmeaningful consequences\u201d if it doesn\u2019t submit to international demands for reining in its nuclear program. \u201cFor our part, the United States is keeping all options on the table in addressing the irresponsible conduct of the regime,\u201d Cheney said. \u201cAnd we join other nations in sending that regime a clear message: We will not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon.\u201d But Cheney made no demands that other regional countries that secretly developed nuclear bombs \u2013 Israel, Pakistan and India \u2013 cease their programs or that older nuclear powers \u2013 the United States, Great Britain, France, Russia and China \u2013 reduce or eliminate their nuclear arsenals. Indeed, President George W. Bush had just completed a trip to India where he reversed longstanding U.S. counter-proliferation policy by agreeing to end a moratorium on India\u2019s access to nuclear fuels, technology and parts while allowing it to continue its nuclear weapons program. Bush\u2019s nuclear deal with India \u2013 a largely Hindu country \u2013 drew criticism from arms-control experts and Muslims as a dangerous double standard that could spur an arms race in South Asia and the Middle East. One-Sided Though Cheney's speech avoided explicitly anti-Muslim language, he singled out Islamic extremism as the greatest threat to the world. The Vice President echoed Bush\u2019s previous remarks about the supposed danger of Islamic terrorists building an empire that would stretch from Spain to Indonesia \u2013 and serve as a base for attacking the United States. \u201cThe terrorists believe that by controlling one country, they will be able to target and overthrow other governments in the region, and ultimately to establish a totalitarian empire that encompasses a region from Spain, across North Africa, through the Middle East and South Asia, all the way around to Indonesia,\u201d Cheney said. But the reality, as known to U.S. intelligence, is far less apocalyptic. Before the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, Osama bin-Laden\u2019s al-Qaeda was holed up in what might be called the ends of the earth, the mountains of Afghanistan \u2013 after his forces were ousted from countries across the Arab world and even were booted out of Sudan. The Bush administration\u2019s failure to capture or kill bin-Laden and other top al-Qaeda leaders during the military offensive around Tora Bora in December 2001 allowed the terrorists to regroup and rebuild support among Islamic extremists \u2013 aided by Muslim anger over Bush\u2019s invasion of Iraq in 2003. But even with al-Qaeda\u2019s limited comeback, its leaders don\u2019t share the grandiose vision that Bush and Cheney ascribe to them. In 2005, an intercepted letter allegedly written by bin-Laden\u2019s deputy Ayman Zawahiri set much more modest goals, fretting that a sudden U.S. withdrawal from Iraq might cause the jihadists to give up and go home. \u201cThe mujahedeen must not have their mission end with the expulsion of the Americans from Iraq, and then lay down their weapons, and silence the fighting zeal,\u201d the \u201cZawahiri letter\u201d read. [For details, see Consortiumnews.com\u2019s \u201cAl-Qaeda Letter Belies Bush\u2019s Iraq Claims.\u201d] Yet, while avoiding Gillerman\u2019s \u201cstraight talk\u201d about Muslims, Cheney substantively agreed with the Israeli ambassador\u2019s assessment of terrorism as almost exclusively a Muslim tactic \u2013 one that flourished because it didn\u2019t draw a sufficiently harsh U.S. response. \u201cOver the last several decades, Americans have seen how the terrorists pursue their objectives,\u201d Cheney said in his AIPAC speech. \u201cSimply stated, they would hit us, but we would not hit back hard enough. \u201cIn Beirut in 1983, terrorists killed 241 Americans, and afterward U.S. forces withdrew from Beirut. In 1993 we had the killing of American soldiers in Mogadishu, and the bombing of the World Trade Center in New York. Then came the attack on the Saudi National Guard Training Center in Riyadh in 1995; the killings at Khobar Towers in 1996; the attack on our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998; and, of course, the attack on the USS Cole in 2000.\u201d Cheney's Bias However, Cheney\u2019s one-sided recounting of history reflects an anti-Muslim bias on two levels. First, it ignores the long history of terrorism practiced around the world by people of nearly all religions and ethnic backgrounds. In 1976, for instance, Chile\u2019s U.S.-backed dictatorship sponsored a terrorist bombing on the streets of Washington, killing Chilean dissident Orlando Letelier and an American co-worker, Ronni Moffitt, yet then-CIA Director George H.W. Bush protected Chile\u2019s leaders from exposure and prosecution. [See Robert Parry\u2019s Secrecy & Privilege.] Even today, the current Bush administration is blocking attempts to bring another anti-communist terrorist, Luis Posada Carriles, to justice over his alleged role in bombing a Cuban airliner. [See Consortiumnews.com\u2019s \u201cBush Family\u2019s Terrorism Test.\u201d] Cheney\u2019s speech also ignored more recent acts of terrorism committed by non-Muslims. For instance, there was no reference in his speech to home-grown right-wing terrorists like Timothy McVeigh, who was convicted and executed for blowing up the federal building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995. For that matter, Cheney offered no self-criticism of the \u201cshock and awe\u201d violence that the Bush administration inflicted on Iraq, killing thousands of civilians in a war launched over false claims about Saddam Hussein\u2019s supposed weapons of mass destruction. At the start of the invasion, Bush ordered the bombing of a Baghdad restaurant where Hussein was suspected of having dinner. Though it turned out Hussein wasn\u2019t there, the attack left 14 civilians dead, including seven children. One mother collapsed when her headless daughter was pulled from the wreckage. But for Cheney and Gillerman, these examples don\u2019t seem to count. Defining Terrorism A second point undermining Cheney\u2019s argument before AIPAC is that some of the cases he cites aren\u2019t acts of terrorism \u2013 which is classically defined as violence directed against civilians to achieve a political goal. In the case of the 1983 bombing in Beirut, for instance, the attackers targeted the Marine barracks because the Reagan-Bush administration\u2019s mission creep had led U.S. forces to intervene militarily against some Muslim elements in the civil war then raging in Lebanon. So, while the killing of the Marines was horrible, it wasn\u2019t terrorism. Similarly, the \u201cBlack Hawk Down\u201d incident in the Somali city of Mogadishu wasn\u2019t an act of terrorism; it was a battle between U.S. Special Forces units and militia troops loyal to a local warlord. Indeed, the Somali militia was reacting to a surprise attack by the American troops, not vice versa. What Cheney appears to be saying is that anytime American troops are killed in a conflict whatever the factual circumstances, they are the victims of \u201cterrorism\u201d \u2013 with all that word\u2019s emotional and propagandistic value. Conversely, acts ordered by President Bush and U.S. allies can never be considered \u201cterrorism\u201d whatever the facts may suggest. There has been a similar blurring of lines in regard to attacks by Iraqi insurgents against U.S. occupation forces in Iraq. While some incidents, such as the destruction of mosques and the killing of civilians, do constitute terrorism, bombs directed at U.S. troops as they patrol Iraqi territory are military ambushes or sabotage, not terrorism. While some Americans might want Iraqi insurgents who are responsible for killing U.S. troops to bear the opprobrium of the disgraced title of \u201cterrorist,\u201d the selective application of the word \u2013 as favored by Cheney and Gillerman \u2013 carries its own danger. Since U.S. policy forbids negotiations with \u201cterrorists,\u201d peace talks with Iraqi insurgents would be barred. That, in turn, could lead to an indefinite war in Iraq and vastly more death and destruction on all sides. That might serve the goals of some neoconservative ideologues \u2013 and ironically the interests of Osama bin-Laden \u2013 but it is almost certainly not in the interests of U.S. troops in Iraq \u2013 nor of the American people. If there is any hope left of winning the \u201cwar of ideas\u201d in the Islamic world, it might well begin with stopping offensive comments about Muslims and protesting when bigoted remarks are uttered by the likes of Ambassador Gillerman.

As arguably the most influential newspaper in the nation\u2019s capital, the Post might have been expected to encourage a healthy pre-war debate that reflected diverse opinions from experts in the fields of government, diplomacy, academia, the military and the broader American public. War, after all, is not a trivial matter. Instead, the Post\u2019s editorial section served as a kind of pro-war bulletin board, posting neoconservative manifestos attesting to the wisdom of invading Iraq and tacking up harsh indictments of Americans who dissented from George W. Bush\u2019s war plans. Yet what is perhaps most amazing is that even now \u2013 after all that\u2019s been learned about Bush\u2019s Iraq War deceptions \u2013 the Post\u2019s editorial page continues to act as the administration\u2019s hall monitor for the war, trying to keep the American people and especially Washington insiders in line. This month, the Post published two more editorials disparaging critics of the Iraq War. One resumed the near-three-year-old campaign to tear down former U.S. Ambassador Joseph Wilson for challenging \u201ctwisted\u201d pre-war intelligence on Iraq; a second scolded retired generals for speaking out against Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. \u2018Good Leak\u2019 In an April 9 editorial, \u201cA Good Leak,\u201d the Post\u2019s editors praised President Bush\u2019s decision in June-July 2003 to declassify parts of a National Intelligence Estimate that were then leaked to favored reporters to undermine Wilson\u2019s criticism of intelligence used to scare the American public about Iraq\u2019s supposed nuclear weapons program. The Post editorial bought into virtually all the administration\u2019s spin points, accepting at face value that Bush intended simply \u201cto make clear why he had believed that Saddam Hussein was seeking nuclear weapons.\u201d The editorial even attacked Wilson as \u201cthe one guilty of twisting the truth.\u201d Yet, the Post leaves out a number of key facts, including that Bush selectively declassified parts of the NIE \u2013 sections on Iraq\u2019s alleged pursuit of enriched uranium in Africa \u2013 though his top aides knew that those points were hotly disputed by many U.S. intelligence experts when the NIE was written and had since been disproved. The available evidence indicates that Bush\u2019s goal was not to educate the public with \u201ca good leak,\u201d but to avoid getting caught in a deception that had misled the nation to war. Ironically, that was the conclusion of a front-page news article in the Post on the same day as the editorial, April 9. The news article cited the fact that Vice President Dick Cheney and his chief of staff, I. Lewis \u201cScooter\u201d Libby, chose to leak information they knew to be false. \u201cThe evidence Cheney and Libby selected to share with reporters had been disproved months before,\u201d the Post\u2019s news article said. \u201cUnited Nations inspectors had exposed the main evidence for the uranium charge as crude forgeries in March 2003, but the Bush administration and British Prime Minister Tony Blair maintained they had additional, secret evidence that they could not disclose. \u201cIn June [2003], a British parliamentary inquiry concluded otherwise, delivering a scathing critique of Blair\u2019s role in promoting the story. With no ally left, the White House debated whether to abandon the uranium claim and became embroiled in bitter finger-pointing about whom to fault for the error. \u2026 \u201cIt was at that moment that Libby, allegedly at Cheney\u2019s direction, sought out at least three reporters to bolster the discredited uranium allegation. Libby made careful selections of language from the 2002 estimate, quoting a passage that said Iraq was \u2018vigorously trying to procure uranium\u2019 in Africa.\u201d In other words, what the Post\u2019s editorial-page editors judged to be \u201ca good leak\u201d was part of a continued disinformation campaign aimed at discrediting Wilson\u2019s accurate assessment about \u201ctwisted\u201d intelligence \u2013 and keeping the American public confused. Watchdog Press? For a U.S. editorial board of a major newspaper to embrace, uncritically, a government\u2019s deception of the American people turns the concept of a watchdog press upside down \u2013 and it is an especially grave offense on a life-and-death issue like war. But the Post\u2019s editorial board went even further, echoing long-standing Republican attacks on Wilson, who has said he traveled to Niger in 2002 at the CIA\u2019s request and concluded from his trip that suspicions of an Iraqi uranium purchase were almost surely untrue. The Post\u2019s editorial, however, challenges Wilson\u2019s honesty, claiming that \u201cseveral subsequent investigations\u201d have demonstrated that \u201cin fact, (Wilson\u2019s) report supported the conclusion that Iraq had sought uranium.\u201d But the Post\u2019s claim is, at best, misleading and, more likely, dishonest. According to all available evidence, Wilson told the truth, that based on his interviews with former Niger government officials, he concluded that the alleged uranium purchase almost certainly did not occur and was not even feasible given the tight international controls on Niger\u2019s enriched uranium, called yellowcake. Wilson did report to the CIA that he was told by former Nigerien Prime Minister Ibrahim Mayaki that he had suspected that an Iraqi commercial delegation to Niger in 1999 might be interested in buying yellowcake, but that the uranium topic didn\u2019t come up at Mayaki's meeting with the Iraqis and \u2013 whatever their intentions \u2013 nothing was sold to Iraq. In 2002, the State Department\u2019s intelligence analysts, who had already correctly concluded that the Niger claims were baseless, reviewed Wilson\u2019s report and believed that his information corroborated their judgment that the Iraq-yellowcake story was bogus. However, CIA analysts, who then were pushing the Niger allegations, seized on Wilson\u2019s comment about Mayaki suspecting that Iraq was in the market for yellowcake as corroboration for the CIA position. That\u2019s why the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee wrote in its July 7, 2004, assessment of the WMD intelligence that \u201cfor most analysts, the information in the [Wilson] report lent more credibility to the original CIA reports on the uranium deal, but State Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research analysts believed that the report supported their assessment that Niger was unlikely to be willing or able to sell uranium to Iraq.\u201d The CIA analysts had \u201ccherry-picked\u201d the one fact from Wilson\u2019s report that could be used to support their faulty judgment about the Niger uranium, while the State Department analysts, who had debunked the Niger story, also found backing for their correct assessment from Wilson\u2019s report. But either way, it wasn\u2019t Wilson\u2019s fault that the CIA and other erroneous analysts outnumbered the State Department analysts who drew the right conclusions from Wilson\u2019s investigation. Yet, the Senate Intelligence Committee, the Republican National Committee and the Washington Post\u2019s editorial page did their own \u201ccherry-picking\u201d in seizing on the phrase \u201cmost analysts\u201d as a way to attack Wilson\u2019s honesty. Under any logical scrutiny, however, that argument makes no sense. Retaliation The Post editorial goes on to slam Wilson again, by citing the supposed findings of special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald, who has been investigating the administration\u2019s leak of the identity of Wilson\u2019s wife, undercover CIA officer Valerie Plame. \u201cMr. Wilson subsequently claimed that the White House set out to punish him for his supposed whistle-blowing by deliberately blowing the cover of his wife,\u201d the Post editorial said. \u201cAfter more than 2 \u00bd years of investigation, Mr. Fitzgerald has reported no evidence to support Mr. Wilson\u2019s charge. \u201cIn last week\u2019s court filing, he [Fitzgerald] stated that Mr. Bush did not authorize the leak of Ms. Plame\u2019s identity. Mr. Libby\u2019s motive in allegedly disclosing her name to reporters, Mr. Fitzgerald said, was to disprove yet another false assertion, that Mr. Wilson had been dispatched to Niger by Mr. Cheney. In fact Mr. Wilson was recommended for the trip by his wife.\u201d But again, the Post editorial writers have gotten almost all their facts wrong, especially the assertion that Fitzgerald didn\u2019t find evidence to support Wilson\u2019s claim that he had been targeted for reprisals because of his whistle-blowing. In the court filing on April 5, 2006, Fitzgerald said his investigation uncovered government documents that \u201ccould be characterized as reflecting a plan to discredit, punish, or seek revenge against Mr. Wilson\u201d because of his criticism of the administration\u2019s handling of the Niger evidence. Fitzgerald added that \u201cthe evidence will show that the July 6, 2003, Op-Ed by Mr. Wilson [in the New York Times] was viewed by the Office of Vice President as a direct attack on the credibility of the Vice President (and the President) on a matter of signal importance: the rationale for the war in Iraq. Defendant [Libby] undertook vigorous efforts to rebut this attack during the week following July 7, 2003.\u201d In other words, Libby\u2019s \u201cvigorous efforts\u201d against Wilson were not simply part of some educational program for reporters; the goal was to defend the credibility of Bush and Cheney at a time (summer 2003) when the American people were learning that the principal argument for going to war \u2013 Iraq\u2019s supposed stockpiles of WMD \u2013 was false. It\u2019s also untrue for the Post editorial to say that Fitzgerald concluded that Libby\u2019s motive for leaking was to disprove the \u201cfalse assertion\u201d that Wilson had been sent to Niger by Cheney. A fair reading of Fitzgerald\u2019s April 5 filing would support a conclusion that Libby was sent out in a counterattack against the threat that Wilson posed to the overall White House credibility on Iraq\u2019s WMD, not to clarify who authorized Wilson's trip. The Post editorial also exaggerates when claiming that Fitzgerald \u201cstated that Mr. Bush did not authorize the leak of Ms. Plame\u2019s identity.\u201d The filing contains nothing definitive on this point, beyond Fitzgerald recounting Libby\u2019s grand jury testimony which has Bush approving disclosure of selective pieces of intelligence, but doesn\u2019t mention Plame. The absence of Libby\u2019s testimony about whether Bush also may have approved the leak of Plame\u2019s identity is not proof that Bush didn\u2019t give such authorization to others; it simply means that Libby didn\u2019t testify to that suspicion. Libby is facing a five-count indictment for perjury, obstruction of justice and lying to the FBI. Republican Assault Another troubling aspect of the Post\u2019s April 9 editorial is how closely it tracks with the long-running Republican assault on Wilson. For years now, Republicans and their right-wing media allies have focused on tiny points of Wilson\u2019s statements as a way to blur the larger picture \u2013 that Wilson was right about the absence of an active Iraqi nuclear program while the Bush administration was wrong. The Post editorial page followed the Republican lead again in an April 18 editorial entitled \u201cthe Generals\u2019 Revolt.\u201d A sub-head characterized the Iraq War complaints from a half dozen retired generals as \u201cfinger-pointing\u201d that should be excluded from the debate over whether Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld should resign. While acknowledging valid concerns about Rumsfeld\u2019s mismanagement of the Iraq War, the Post editorial calls the \u201crebellion\u201d of the retired generals \u201cproblematic.\u201d \u201cIt threatens the essential democratic principle of military subordination to civilian control \u2013 the more so because a couple of the officers claim they are speaking for some still on active duty,\u201d the editorial said. It then compares the Iraq War critiques by these retired generals to the opposition from the uniformed military, including then-Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefls of Staff, against President Bill Clinton\u2019s plan to allow gays in the military. But the comparison is faulty. For one, the retired generals are retired, not active-duty as Powell was in 1993. Also, until these half dozen or so ex-generals spoke out critically about Bush\u2019s Iraq policies, no one in memory had ever argued that private citizens who previously served in the military should remain silent about questions of war and peace. The Post editorial board never objected when retired generals appeared on CNN or other TV news programs supporting the Iraq War or when President Bush claimed that he was following the advice of the generals in Iraq, including some of those now out of uniform who are contradicting Bush\u2019s claim. Rather than following the facts and logic to a conclusion, the Post editorials seem to start with an ideological conclusion \u2013 that Bush must be defended \u2013 and then cobble the available spin points together into some dubious argument. Long Pattern These two editorials in April also do not stand alone. They are part of a long pattern at the Post to ignore or denigrate Iraq War critics \u2013 both in the news columns and on the opinion pages. Sometimes before the Iraq invasion, Post readers learned about voices of dissent by reading Post columnists denouncing the dissenters. For instance, when former Vice President Al Gore gave a speech about Iraq and Bush\u2019s \u201cpreemptive war\u201d doctrine on Sept. 23, 2002, his talk got scant press coverage, but did elicit a round of Gore-bashing on the TV talk shows and on the Post\u2019s Op-Ed page. [See Consortiumnews.com\u2019s \u201cPolitics of Preemption.\u201d] Post columnist Michael Kelly called Gore\u2019s speech \u201cdishonest, cheap, low\u201d before labeling it \u201cwretched. It was vile. It was contemptible.\u201d [Washington Post, Sept. 25, 2002] Post columnist Charles Krauthammer added that the speech was \u201ca series of cheap shots strung together without logic or coherence.\u201d [Washington Post, Sept. 27, 2002] When reading the Post\u2019s pre-war coverage, there was a whiff of totalitarianism in which dissidents never get space to express their opinions but are still excoriated by the official media. When the state speaks, however, the same media hails the government\u2019s brilliance. For instance, after Secretary of State Powell\u2019s now-infamous speech to the United Nations Security Council on Feb. 5, 2003, a Post editorial called his arguments \u201cirrefutable,\u201d adding: \u201cit is hard to imagine how anyone could doubt that Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction.\u201d That judgment was echoed across the Op-Ed page by Post columnists from Right to Left, a solid wall of misguided consensus. But the Post\u2019s gullibility about Powell\u2019s testimony wasn\u2019t an exception. As a study by Columbia University journalism professor Todd Gitlin noted, \u201cThe [Post] editorials during December [2002] and January [2003] numbered nine, and all were hawkish.\u201d [American Prospect, April 1, 2003] After the U.S. invasion of Iraq in March 2003 and the failure to discover evidence supporting the administration\u2019s pre-war claims, editorial-page editor Fred Hiatt acknowledged that the Post should have been more skeptical. \u201cIf you look at the editorials we write running up [to the war], we state as flat fact that he [Hussein] has weapons of mass destruction,\u201d Hiatt said in an interview with the Columbia Journalism Review. \u201cIf that\u2019s not true, it would have been better not to say it.\u201d [CJR, March/April 2004] Repeat Offenders But Hiatt\u2019s supposed remorse hasn\u2019t stopped him and the Post editorial page from continuing their assault on anyone who questions Bush\u2019s Iraq War strategy. On Feb. 7, 2005, Hiatt penned a column under his own name, entitled \u201cBad News Donkeys,\u201d in which he chastised Sen. John Kerry and other Democrats for not showing enough enthusiasm over the Jan. 30, 2005, elections in Iraq. Hiatt wrote that Kerry \u201cgrumped\u201d his answer about the Iraq election when the senator told NBC\u2019s Tim Russert that \u201cI think it\u2019s gone as expected.\u201d Days later when House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi pressed for a clearer exit strategy for U.S. troops, Hiatt judged that her comments \u201csounded grudging and morose.\u201d In case Post readers hadn\u2019t gotten Hiatt\u2019s point, he finished up his column comparing the Democrats to the sad-sack character Eeyore in the Winnie-the-Pooh stories. Though the Jan. 30, 2005, election turned out to be more a mirage than an oasis, the Post\u2019s editorial page was back asserting its august judgments again in June 2005 after thousands of readers complained that the Post was ignoring the \u201cDowning Street Memo\u201d and other evidence of Bush\u2019s Iraq War deceptions. On June 15, 2005, the Post\u2019s lead editorial asserted that \u201cthe memos add not a single fact to what was previously known about the administration\u2019s prewar deliberations. Not only that: They add nothing to what was publicly known in July 2002.\u201d While that claim may be true in a way \u2013 because some people indeed were challenging Bush\u2019s case for war, albeit without the damning details \u2013 the problem was that the Post and other pro-war news outlets were treating those skeptics as fringe characters who should be ignored. Looking back to 2002 and early 2003, it would be hard to find any \u201creputable\u201d commentary in the mainstream U.S. press calling Bush\u2019s actions fraudulent, which is what the \u201cDowning Street Memo\u201d and other British evidence have since revealed Bush\u2019s actions to be. The British documents prove that much of the pre-war debate inside the U.S. and British governments was how best to manipulate public opinion by playing games with the intelligence. On July 23, 2002, for instance, Blair met with his top foreign policy advisers to review the Iraq situation. According to the minutes, which became known as the \u201cDowning Street Memo,\u201d Richard Dearlove, chief of the British intelligence agency MI6, described a recent trip to Washington at which he discussed Iraq with Bush\u2019s top national security officials. \u201cBush wanted to remove Saddam, through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD. But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy,\u201d Dearlove said. One might have thought that this pattern of official deception \u2013 effectively making fools out of the Post\u2019s editorial page and, to a lesser extent, the news columns \u2013 would have stirred up some outrage from Hiatt and his boss, Washington Post Chairman Donald Graham. But Hiatt and Graham seem to be beyond shame, or perhaps they are committed neoconservatives who simply won\u2019t let facts get in the way of their ideological convictions. Now, despite even more evidence of the Bush administration\u2019s pre-war lies, the Post editorial board is back at its role trying to construct a consensus by marginalizing Ambassador Wilson and silencing the retired generals. The Post\u2019s goal apparently is to protect George W. Bush from public outrage over his Iraq War deceptions \u2013 that have led to so much death, injury and destruction \u2013 while sparing the Post\u2019s editors from the journalistic disdain that they have so richly earned.

It is primarily about putting the brakes on what has slowly been developing into the next world war.\n\nThis new deal may also represent a serious culmination of Russian, Chinese, and Iranian efforts to realign the entire bandwidth between the Adriatic Sea and India. This has ramifications not only for the EU, Bulgaria, and Turkey, but also Syria, Egypt, Israel, Iran, China and most of Latin America. Its effects reach far beyond the scope of this report, and includes currency wars, and military alliances.\n\nThus, this turn of events may be massive, and the culmination of the success which Iraq, Iran, and Syria have had, with their allies, in rolling back ISIS. Additionally, this comes on the heels of the big changes in Egypt, which saw Turkey\u2019s main ally in the war on Syria removed. It also represents a major revival of the Russian effort to build an alternative route to the line going through Ukraine. That line has been the subject of numerous problems as the Ukrainians had been difficult partners. The recent outbreak of hostilities within Ukraine has made them an even less reliable partner, pushing the need to speed up the process of an alternative Russian gas route into high gear.\n\nLet us begin with the reality as it has been presented. On December 1st, Russia declared to the world that it had dumped the South Stream project because the European Union had decided that it did not want it.\n\nThe EU can be said to have decided this simply because it placed too many barriers on the project, mostly surrounding two factors.\n\nThe first factor was a constraint placed on the project by the Third Energy Package (TEP), which was passed in the EU in 2009. This was done much after the South Stream project had already been proposed in 2007, and the tentative agreement already inked. This change of conditions after the fact means that Russia has not abrogated any of its commitments, either morally or legally. This is important in terms of Russia\u2019s other numerous important trading and strategic partners, both in the region, and in the world. No one will see that Russia pulls the plug on deals it makes.\n\nIn fact, Russia showed both good faith and due diligence in all spheres of the South Stream negotiations and construction process. The initial terms of South Stream were made under conditions prior to the latest round of restrictions placed upon Russia, on top of the Third Energy Package. In other considerations, as the project evolved, some elements of the TEP were interpreted in a way which still made the South Stream a viable project. This means that the signatories to the South Stream tentative agreement cannot be held retroactively accountable for newer restrictions to the execution or workability of said agreement, which were unforeseeable at the time of the deal. As the deal evolved over time, the manner by which the restrictions imposed by TEP were interpreted, also figured into the entire project.\n\nThe second factor is that Bulgaria had been under extraordinary pressure to conform to EU dictates in this arena. The Bulgarian reluctance to buck EU dictates was understood by Putin, which is reflected in the exact words that were used to describe the failure on the Bulgarian end. By and large, blame was placed on the EU for pressuring Bulgaria. At the level of diplomacy, this gives the Bulgarians an important out, which will figure into this analysis, shortly. Simultaneously, given how power is popularly understood, the Bulgarian government is being held by Bulgarians \u2013 who mostly wanted this project for a range of obvious reasons \u2013 as being primarily responsible. The Bulgarians were also thinking they had an option, which was snapped away from them with this Russian-Turkish deal. This will also figure into the scope of things to come, that we will describe.\n\nVarious news agencies around the world ran with the simple headline that Putin had cancelled South-Stream. Some agencies and analysis groups viewed this as a show of Russian weakness, and others of Russian strength. On the balance, just looking at the headlines as wholly descriptive, we can determine that Russia has acted out of strength. They are actually leaving room for flexibility, and has hinted at conditions for workability.\n\nWe are justified in saying this for three main reasons.\n\nThe first is that Putin made the statement, it was not made by Europe or for him by others. This means that he was not responding to a question or unforeseen circumstance, but rather this was a calculated pronouncement and made at a time of his choosing. The words were chosen quite carefully. His exact words must be examined.\n\n\u201cBearing in mind the fact that we have not yet received Bulgaria\u2019s permission, we think Russia in such conditions cannot continue this project,\u201d\n\nHe continued on, \u201cIf Europe doesn\u2019t want to realize this, then it means it won\u2019t be realized. We will redirect the flow of our energy resources to other regions of the world.\u201d\n\nThe first clause of the first quote, uses the word \u2018yet\u2019. Alternate words that would eliminate any room for consideration would have been \u2018Bearing in mind the fact that we will never receive Bulgaria\u2019s permission.\u2019\n\nIn order to clarify the open nature that is communicated here, he says \u2018in such conditions\u2019. That is, under these conditions, but not other conditions. In other conditions, logically if follows, perhaps something is possible. But, also, perhaps not.\n\nIn the second quote, he uses the word \u2018If\u2019. Not \u2018Since\u2019, or \u2018Because\u2019, but \u2018If\u2019. In short, \u201cif\u201d they don\u2019t want to realize this, it won\u2019t be realized. If they do want this realized, then perhaps it can be realized. Or not.\n\nAlso in this second quote is a statement which runs counter to the actual concept behind the Russian-Turkish gas deal. Indeed it does aim to direct the flow to Europe, and not other regions of the world as such. Recall that the Turkish hub is on the European side, near the Greek border. Russia\u2019s Ambassador to the European Union Vladimir Chizhov was clear when he said, \u201cThe gas pipeline thread may go in any direction from the Turkish hub,\u201d. [1]\n\nThese statements furthermore seem to align not only with developments in Ukraine, but also in Syria, which we will elaborate on here as well. This also means that the statement ought to be viewed in light of how Russia makes its official statements, which are almost always multi-layered messages.\n\nSecondly, most news stories and news analysis also somewhat correctly mentioned that Putin simultaneously had been in Ankara where he ironed out a deal with Erdogan. Putin announced that he and Erdogan had come to terms on increasing the volume of the Blue-Stream pipeline to Turkey, and creating a new pipeline to Turkey. It is chiefly important here to mention that such a high level meeting means that there is much more to this than an energy deal.\n\nAfter all, if this was the sole subject of the meeting, such a deal could have been made between Gazprom\u2019s Alexei Miller, or even one of his subordinates, and their Turkish counterparts. However, importantly is the fact that Turkish energy minister Taner Yildiz has gone on record saying that final terms have not been made. A number of outstanding issues remain, apparently, such as the price of gas. Russia has offered a 6% discount, but Turkey may end up with two or three times greater than that figure (18%). Still, Turkey has enabled Russia to make an important announcement at a critical time. Turkey is no doubt aware that this relates to the two aforementioned conflicts. Still relevant are the more banal and well publicized economic concerns concerning solvency in the EU as well, including decreased demand.\n\nAdditionally, Russia has publically announced a $40-bn+ gas deal with India, as well as commitment to build nuclear power facilities. Interestingly, India and Russia planned as far back as August, and perhaps April of 2014, to make this announcement in December. This lends credence to the \u2018strategic nature\u2019 hypothesis of Putin\u2019s well timed announcement on Turkey. \u201d An announcement on this initiative is expected to be made in December when the two leaders meet at the India-Russia annual summit to be held in New Delhi.\u201d [2].\n\nIt is possible that an outstanding issue may relate to how Turkey\u2019s previous plans can be combined with a new Russian-Turkish pipeline, which we will also explore in this report.\n\nThird, as we will explain here in greater detail, this plan removes some of the alternate projects which Bulgaria and the EU thought they could rely on resurrecting, or further developing, in the final event of a Russian pull-out from the South Stream project. Perhaps they had even intended for the Russians to further build in the Black Sea, only to pull the plug at a later phase, and ultimately have their efforts be for nothing, at great expense for Russia.\n\nIn truth, it is both too soon and too hard to tell what will happen exactly.\n\nWhat Putin stressed was that the decision on whether or not this project can work was Europe\u2019s to make. This is an open door.\n\nThis seems to really contradict Putin\u2019s statement about not having gas go to Europe. Indeed, what we have actually been presented is, for the European project, a rebranded South Stream which now may also simply be combined with Nabucco. This is because the new proposed line to Turkey goes to the European region of Turkish Thrace.\n\nWhat we are to make of this depends on how we understand larger questions about the world we live in.\n\nThe reality of the \u2018cancellation of South Stream\u2019 is an example of a creation of a simulated hyper-reality to dissemble the actual reality of the situation. This meme has now bounced off of all media walls, including alternative media and new media. It has created an echo-chamber truth of its own. We can understand that there are numerous targets of this weaponized bit of information, within the context of the information war at hand.\n\nIt should be no surprise that things are not what they seem. We live in an increasingly complex world which witnesses an increasing sophistication in the multiple layers of meaning, which are embedded in official statements as they are reported. We can say that the increasing bellicosity in general parallels the increased complexity of these messages.\n\nThe details of the proposed deal with Turkey are of some significance. But we can only say with certainty, that what is important at this stage is that the plans seem credible insofar as they are workable.\n\nRussia has officially gone on a media campaign to sell the workability of the Russian-Turkish Stream plan. In a map provided to the public by RT, Russia\u2019s English language state news agency, we can see clearly what the intended message is.\n\nGiven that the main Russkaya CS plant which was built to handle the capacity of the South Stream line will still be used, and together with this, and the portions of pipe which have already been laid outside of Bulgaria that can still be used, the 5-bn Euros already spent on the project can be easily switched for similar use in a Russian-Turkish Stream scenario. That alone foils one part of a possible US backed EU ploy to lure Russia into an ultimately dead-end project, which would have had the real potential of destabilizing the political structure inside of Russia itself.\n\nIf an actual Russian-Turkish stream is built, this will be the case, that Russian efforts have not gone to waste. But what is most critical at this stage is that it adds credence to the Russian announcement. Looking at the map we can see that this is not simply a pipeline to Turkey. It is not simply a different deal, now aimed at Turkey.\n\nNo, clearly this is a repackaged South Stream pipeline which now simply routes 150km south of the Bulgarian South Stream proposal, and through Turkey instead. It also combines, now, elements of the Turkish Nabucco plan, as it now involves Greece and Macedonia, before it would turn north through Serbia, as well as having the potential to reconsider the Southern Corridor, as we will explore later in this report.\n\nPerhaps under Russian consultation of this possibility, we can understand why Serbia began construction not in the south-east where it would have connected to the Bulgarian line, but rather in Novi Sad in the north. This pipe laid in Novi Sad would be the route of either a South Stream or a slightly revised Nabucco in its new incarnation as the Russian-Turkish line. Taken together, this new plan is the Russian-Turkish deal.\n\nIndeed, we can see that with some modification, Russia and Turkey has proposed to combine the Nabucco and South Stream projects. This was actually proposed by Chief Executive Officer of Italian energy company Eni, Paolo Scaronione, the Italian project company involved in South Stream, at an early stage of negotiations. While mainstream reporting gave a number of reasons why this proposal was initially rejected, what we know for certain is that the logistics and workability of such a plan to combine these two projects have been known about for several years [3].\n\nIt is interesting to consider then, that in retrospect, after all of the intrigue and blood spilt over this contest, that the Scaronione plan based on cooperation, collaboration, and peace, would be the one that actually worked out. Moreover, the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) which was sometimes a variation of the Nabucco plan, was also a variation of South Stream.\n\nThe more one looks at this, given the considerable weight which is given to the opinions of Scaronione, the more one must entertain the possibility that this Turkish reversal was in the works from the start. Turkey always seemed to play its role with NATO against Syria, but in retrospect we can see that they did not \u2018retaliate\u2019 as expected when Syrian air defenses shot down the Turkish fighter jet, among other things [4]. They did not move against Syria as robustly as they could have, and they never entirely shut the door on Iran. From the start, they did not freely allow just any mercenary or jihadi passage from Turkey into Syria, and even arrested (and captured caches) those connected to Libya (Belhaj) and Europe, funded by the Saudis and Qataris [5].\n\nIran was always looking for rapprochement with Turkey. Iran wanted to be part of Nabucco, and made the offer as early as 2009 before the outbreak of hostilities, and now it looks like they will have that opportunity. Indeed Erdogan told a gathering of Nabucco partner countries and regional countries in that same year, which included Iraq and Georgia: \u201cWe desire Iranian gas to be included in Nabucco when conditions allow,\u201d [6]\n\nBut the US\u2019s own special energy envoy Richard Morningstar was clear that Washington would not allow the Iranians to take part. The strangeness of the US opposition may have escaped the average American reader, here. Nabucco in no way involved the US directly, it is not a trans-Atlantic project. This is, at the very most, a question which only ought to be of concern to those countries that will be involved in the production, transport, and consumption of the goods and services provided.\n\nWhat the US offered instead to Turkey was that it should throw its international reputation into the wind, and facilitate an ultimately failed attempt to make \u2018regime change\u2019 in Syria.\n\nIt was always known that the Nabucco plan and the South Stream plan, while pitched as competing plans, really seem to be the same project, pitched differently, involving different power blocs, but interestingly, some of the same project companies.\n\nIn theory, then, nothing will be different for Serbia or the other countries along the pipeline. In fact, this might even work better for Russia in that it now involves Turkey, Greece, and Macedonia as it re-routes to get back on its path which travels north through Serbia, into Hungary, Austria, etc. For the consumer states, price wise, we should not expect a tremendous difference. The discount that Turkey receives from Russia will allow for Turkish profitability with a savings that can be passed onto the consumer states.\n\nThis is not just about energy markets, but changing political and military partners.\n\nSerbia, Austria, and Hungary are not only still on board with South Stream, or any other name this rose is called, but Hungary and Serbia have sworn off sanctions on Russia. Hungary has even threatened to leave the EU over South Stream, and has also refused to become entangled again in a problematic IMF loan, now after having paid off its debt. Russia is presently building the facility and military intelligence infrastructure, in what could soon become an actual military installation, in the south of Serbia near Nish. This is also an area where the South Stream, or by any other name, will travel through Serbia.\n\nSerbia has not made significant progress in moving towards the EU. It has still not recognized Kosovo, which is an unofficial condition for EU entry. Other matters such as the above mentioned Russian military intelligence hub, Putin\u2019s presence and receiving the highest award at a distinctly Slavic style military parade, have emerged since, which have infuriated EU bureaucrats and NATO chiefs alike.\n\nThus, Hungary and Serbia, and because of details ironed out with OMV, Austria as well, are still on board with the project. With very minor adjustments, this Russian-Turkish stream will be the same for them as the South Stream. So, Russia\u2019s December 1 announcement was not targeted at them. In fact, taken together with the Russian-Turkish Stream, it is a big sigh of relief.\n\nRather, certain sections of the Bulgarian establishment are the immediate target of this announcement. It is very important to create the all-round sense that Bulgaria can be left out of the equation, if it doesn\u2019t do something decisive, and quickly. If these matters were as simple to understand as the official statements made, then most people following the headlines would understand matters as they stand. The truth, however, is more complicated.\n\nIn bargaining, to say that a deal is off the table is actually part of the bargaining process. For those already familiar with this point, please forgive that we must belabor it for a moment. This is true all over the world, but is a particularly known bargaining tactic in Eurasia and the Middle-east. It is accurate to include that this tactic is used in the far west, even where business culture tends to be based more on the proclivities and sensitivities of those in the Anglosphere. Nevertheless, Slavs, Arabs,Turks, and Iranians do business differently. Saying that a deal is off the table is neither rude, nor is it a deal breaker. It is also not limited to business, but also informs other spheres of life such as romance and friendships. It is an often critical part of the deal making process. In a way which may seem counter-intuitive to westerners, this actually builds trust.\n\nConcepts and legal norms against things like regressive bargaining still exist, but this is not a case of that. In the face of interesting, new, and creative interpretations of the Third Energy Package that was forced upon Europe under the influence of a semi-suicidal hypnotic trance, induced by the Trans-Atlantic power structure, Bulgaria reneged on its obligation to go forward with the plan.\n\nAnd yet, to say that Bulgaria does not want to be included in a pipe-line project is not at all true. Bulgaria still wants the plan, and on their end they insist there can still be one. It was Europe that placed Bulgaria into this situation. It was the EU that has interfered with Bulgaria\u2019s electoral process, resulting in the present government.\n\nPutin\u2019s announcement was also aimed at the EU, and by extension, the US.\n\nThis is about calling Europe\u2019s bluff. Europe assumed that it could then change the legal framework of doing energy business with Europe by interpreting the Third Energy Package in new and creative ways, even after its own member states had bent over backwards to meet the already onerous and cumbersome restrictions, derived from the last round of sabotage.\n\nEurope then assumed that it could act with increased hostility to Russia, involving themselves in the training, arming, and equipping of neo-nazis in Ukraine, and staging a coup to frustrate Ukraine\u2019s integration into the Eurasian Customs Union. Then Europe assumed that it could then proceed to impose on itself some serious self-inflicted wounds under the title \u201csanctions on Russia\u201d, which have also not been a walk in the park for the Russians. Europe assumed that it could do all of this, and more, and that Russia would be so desperate that in light of all of this, in light of the TEP, Ukraine, sanctions, and more, that Russia would pay forward the costs of developing the project, but let Europe control the physical infrastructures , revenues, and other critical aspects.\n\nStill, it is possible that the deal is off the table for Bulgaria. But no one can say definitively whether it is right now. Sections from the Bulgarian elite are saying there is still a deal. This means that they are doing one of two things. One, they are accurately interpreting this December 1st statement as being serious bargaining language, and are trying to figure out how to reorganize themselves politically, making a \u2018civilizational\u2019 decision regarding Russia vs. the EU in its Atlanticist incarnation, and looking to make a counter-offer. Or, they are unable to meet these demands.\n\nThus they would be buying time by trying to give false assurances to the tremendous and powerful interests inside of Bulgaria involved in the South Stream project. As well, they would trying to placate the general populace who supported this, in order to stave off a rapid descent into political chaos.\n\nAlexei Miller blames Bulgaria entirely, plays the role of bad cop, and says that the closing of the project had nothing to do with TEP. This is an important warning to Bulgaria that it needs to move quickly. Putin plays the role of good cop, and allows PR cover for the Bulgarian government, blaming the EU, and giving the Bulgarian government some face-saving wiggle room.\n\nA Russian-Turkish line does not have to exclude Bulgaria. Russia has Bulgaria very concerned, for not only have they been told that the new line will exclude them, but that after it is complete, they will also be cut out of the line that runs from Ukraine. That is a major cause for concern for Bulgaria, one which can force them to make a \u2018civilizational\u2019 decision, one which will determine their alignment for the next number of decades to come, and beyond. Bulgaria may have been misled into thinking that they could play games. They may have believed that in the event of a South Stream collapse, the Nabucco project could be brought back to life, despite problems with the Shah Deniz energy consortium, and the failure for the Nabucco project to make headway in the Levant, in the wake of serious Turkish, US and Israeli defeats vis-\u00e0-vis Syria and Egypt.\n\nPeople are wondering why Europe is making such a huge mistake with the way they are interpreting and enforcing the TEP. Yes, it can be said that Europe made a mistake here. Or, it can be said that Europe intentionally sabotaged this, and in so doing, sabotaged its own economy. This latter case is almost understandable with an understanding of the considerable pressure which the US exerts on Europe. The latter case makes more sense.\n\nThere are several critical factors facing Europe. We can look at a few of them.\n\nOne critical factor which is often ignored by analysts looking at the \u2018Triangle\u2019 of Atlanticist Europe, Eurasia, and the \u2018Near East\u2019 (the Balkans, Turkey, and Arab World) is that this is actually a \u2018Square\u2019. Europe is being threatened by the US that it will lose access to Latin America.\n\nOne point worth mentioning here is that the US has said that the age of the \u201cMonroe Doctrine\u201d is over. Of course, this statement was aimed at Russia regarding Georgia, but in a different way also at Europe. Today European investment in Latin America \u2013 considered in the 19th century to be within the US\u2019s realm of influence by the Monroe Doctrine \u2013 is not insignificant. Formal institutions, aimed at coordination, like the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the Latin American Investment Facility (LAIF) represent but a tip of the iceberg in this regard. There is also increasing investment from Latin American countries and firms into Europe. All countries in Western Europe are tied to investments in Latin America. The US tries to project to Europe that it has the capacity to effect coups or transitions of power in Latin America. It shows it can do this through its traditional means of the military coup, or new methods such as the Color Revolution and Arab Spring tactic.\n\nBoth of these methods have failed to effect change in the so-called \u2018Pink Tide\u2019 countries in Latin America. But a statistically improbably number of Pink Tide leaders either have cancer, or in the case of Chavez, have already died of it. Of course the US still does business with Pink Tide countries. But those terms are not as lucrative as they would be if those governments were mere puppets. A portion of US trade with Latin America is done through proxies in Europe, or through MNC\u2019s and TNC\u2019s whose governing boards are comprised of both US and European nationals.\n\nThe European elite are divided. Those who follow US dictates are tied to US interests in numerous ways.\n\nOthers in this lot are heavily invested in Latin America, and have not been convinced that the Russians or Chinese can protect these European investments from the US, in the event of a US initiated change of government in most Latin American countries, as in, signifying a return to the Monroe Doctrine. On the other hand are those in Europe who are more connected to Eurasia. Right now they are both upset, and weakened. Perhaps the window of opportunity for them to effect a concerted effort to change the present course has passed. Perhaps it has not.\n\nThere is also another critical factor which revolves around other gas deals that had been in the works.\n\nIndeed there is still yet another rational explanation, however, to Europe\u2019s otherwise blundering arrogance. Europe, like Bulgaria, was also thinking that it had options, which the Russian-Turkish deal actually makes an end-run around.\n\nThe US was also excited about this, and it related to its efforts in the Middle-East. This was the so-called Southern Corridor plan, a part of Nabucco.\n\nSo, this partly explains the extraordinary efforts that the US has engaged in to overthrow the government of Syria. Syria was the best choice to host a branch for Egyptian and Israeli liquefied natural gas into the Nabucco pipeline network.\n\nThe Nabucco line was to be a Turkish project, but on the European side involved a number of the same firms that would later go over to the South Stream project. The Nabucco line also involved a number of the same countries as well. Critically; Bulgaria, Hungary and Austria.\n\nThe South Stream was different in its starting point, and its trans-Pontic route. Instead of Romania, it favored Serbia. Other than this, they were very similar projects. Because they involved many of the same project companies on the European side, and promised to deliver similar volumes, the final decision to go with South Stream was a product of Russian success in the realms of diplomacy and related areas of intrigue.\n\nAdditionally, the Nabucco project did not have the assurances on the eastern end, and would also have been a project that involved a number of companies and interests before arriving in Europe. This also increased the cost. Thus, the ease of doing business, and the superior form of coordination that comes from dealing with a single state-owned company, such as Gazprom, was another important factor. Keeping various and even conflicting multiple project companies all together, for ten years on a project that had not even broken ground, as was the case with Nabucco, was a lot like herding cats.\n\nHowever, the Nabucco line was to get a good portion of its gas from the Azeri controlled Caspian offshore, a project under the control of the Shah Deniz energy consortium which works closely with BP. This was to rely on support from Azerbaijan, passing through it, and as well possibly Georgia, and then into Turkey.\n\nFor a number of reasons, which Nabucco was nixed when the Shah Deniz consortium decided to handle the project differently. Then it was resurrected with a different route. The background to this issue involves matters out of the scope of this report, but revolves around the complicated relationships between Russia and the post-Soviet states in the Caucuses, and the manner by which the latter have also made relationships with Turkey, within the context of constant meddling from the US and EU.\n\nTo state it clearly, time-frames notwithstanding, there were three projects. The South Stream, the Nabucco, and the Trans-Anatolian to Trans Adriatic (TANAP/TAP). But all three of them could not all go forward. Contradictions or overlaps not only between the project companies, but also the underlying broader geostrategic and geopolitical concerns meant that TANAP/TAP could not go forward without the Nabucco going forward as most plans have these merged, and Nabucco was less viable at any rate with South Stream going forward.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the TANAP/TAP and the Nabucco are really one and the same. This is so even if there were differences in project conceptions, involving some different project companies and minor differences in route. At a point last year, it looked as Nabucco would work with the Shah Deniz consortium and actually take a Central European route, through the North-South corridor. This would have meandered up from Nabucco in Hungary, and towards the Baltic Sea cutting through both Slovakia and Czech Republic, and through Poland.\n\nThis would have undermined the importance of two Russian lines, through Ukraine and Nord Stream. But changes in the Hungarian political landscape, towards an overtly pro-Russian position, made this route unlikely. To cut up from Romania through Ukraine would be a burdensome addition by way of kilometers of pipe, given the project always had funding problems and what were perceived as inflated costs.\n\nWhat this boiled down to was the EU encouraged on by the US, having Turkey and Russia compete endlessly.\n\nThis is also why, since last week\u2019s announcement, EU\u2019s optimistic talk of the TANAP/TAP project revival can seem strangely out of touch with reality. Turkey, of course, is wise to diversify its sources, working with Azeri partners as well as Russian. The Shah Deniz fields are estimated at no more than 1 trln. cm as opposed to Russia\u2019s 48 trln. cm. The Azeri estimated reserves are thus only about 2 % of the Russian [7].\n\nYes, the Azeris may produce, together with what they have and with the Shah Deniz II expansion, as much as 40 bcm per year. But with a realistic reserve quantity of 1trln. cm, this isn\u2019t going to last very long in the scheme of things, especially if production is to be expanded further. So we can see that while Azeri contributions meant something, if the entire plan is to be worth the long term aims, always meant a combination with Nabucco.\n\nThis in turn substantively meant the Southern Corridor through the Levant.\n\nThe Southern Corridor is a critical piece. Azeri gas from the Shah Deniz field promised to make a new route viable. Without Nabucco and Turkey, the Azeri\u2019s really could not fund this. Construction never began on Nabucco, and experienced all of the confusion between project companies, funding issues, and changed routes as described above. What it relied on, to work, was incorporating Egyptian, Israeli, and Syrian gas to make a Southern Corridor, into Turkey and connect with the rest of Nabucco.\n\nTANAP/TAP cannot really work as a stand-alone project. Europeans are at best talking their book, at worst, sorely misinformed. Given the levels of ineptitude and nepotism which prevail in \u2018Old Europe\u2019, this last possibility is actually a great one.\n\nThis reality played a factor in the Arab Spring in Egypt and Syria. Turkey backed the Arab Spring in Egypt, and had their man, Morsi, installed. Morsi was not simply installed as part of the Arab Spring tactic by the US and Israel as part of a broader regional move against Iran. Of course, this much is true. But further, this in Egypt, was supposed to be a major development allowing for Egyptian natural gas to get to Turkey, through Israel and a Syria under a new western backed \u201cFSA\u201d leadership that favored Egypt, Israel, and Turkey over Iran and broadly speaking, Russia.\n\nStill Turkey\u2019s previous plans with the Southern Corridor can be combined with a new Russian-Turkish pipeline. This possibility may really underscore the significance of the Russian-Turkish deal, and the entire geostrategic and geopolitical realignment which may be underway.\n\nEssentially, the position of Azerbaijan, Turkey and Israel as being firm pro-Western and anti-Russian natural gas interests meant that Egypt and Syria would have to experience \u2018regime change\u2019 for all the pieces to link up. While Egypt under Mubarak received western military aid and was an important US ally during the last decade of the cold war, and interpreting most generously could be said to have \u201clooked the other way\u201d on Israel-Palestine, he was opposed to regime change in Syria. Syria could not act in line with a Turkish and Israeli plan given its relations with Iran, and Turkish relations with Iran.\n\nThe stage was set, then to make a \u201cregime change\u201d in Egypt and Syria, thus angling out Iran, and perhaps even forcing Lebanon to act in concert with Israel against Hezbollah.\n\nBut Iran and Russia, working with Syria and its SAA effectively pushed back the foreign mercenary and Salafist invasion of Syria. Yes, the US and Israel still push with its Saudi friends to finance a quasi-mythical ISIS, and even here in recent days we have seen a series of big defeats for ISIS. In fact, these three latest major events \u2013 The Turkish-Russian gas deal announcement, the defeats suffered by ISIS, and the Israeli air-force provocations on Syria, are all intimately connected.\n\nIn the course of the Turkish end of the war against Syria, the disorganization, losses, and problematic western led alliance were such that pre-existing tensions between the Sauds and Qataris were exacerbated. Turkey\u2019s friendly Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt was subject to severe persecution in the pro-Salafist realm of peninsular Arabia. Turkey\u2019s friendly MB front in Palestine, Hamas, was being actively courted by Iran.\n\nIn the last year of this conflict, in the wake of the failed western attempt to blame Syria for a chemical attack it staged itself, Iran-Turkey relations have in fact warmed, seeing a 400% increase in bilateral trade. Furthermore, Turkey reversed its decision on the convictions of leading Pro-Russian \u2018Eurasianist\u2019 leaders, some even in the military, who had been caught up in the so-called Ergenekon conspiracy. This included the prominent Worker\u2019s Party leader, Dogu Perencek, and other of his ranking Maoist-Kemalist comrades. This last piece is significant in its symbolism more than anything else, but we live in a world of symbols and signs.\n\nWhat we were left with, finally then, as a result, was the total fracturing of the US and Israeli led alliance against Syria. Russia worked with some partners in the region to reverse the Arab Spring in Egypt, seeing the ousting of Morsi and his replacement by Sisi. At first glance, this is a set-back for Turkey as well, and Russians may have either worked with, or fooled, the Saudis in helping with this. Analysis on Saudi-Russian bilateral relations are generally a nebulous cloud of disinformation and misinformation, and we will leave these and related questions out of this report.\n\nNow there is a new reality, the situation has reversed.\n\nIran-Turkey relations have warmed, and so have Russian-Turkish relations. Egypt has committed itself in the area of foreign policy, to a good relationship with Ba\u2019athist Syria of Assad. Egypt will maintain Mubaraks\u2019 old arrangement with Israel with regard to Palestine, tunnels, and the like. But Egyptian natural gas will only make its way, now, through to Turkey\u2019s \u2018Russian Turkish Line\u2019, replacing Nabucco, if it goes through the legitimate government of Syria.\n\nIf it is also to involve Israel, it may be possible to place some conditions on Israel.\n\nBesides ending its war against Syria, and ending its rhetoric on Iran, it could also include the recognition of Palestine and profit sharing with Palestine, whom the offshore Gazan resource legally belongs to. We should not be optimistic here, but as well it is possible for a new route for the Egyptian end, as the southern-most part of the \u2018new\u2019 Southern-Corridor project, to meander through the Sinai through Jordan, or go by sea to Syria.\n\nThis may mean that if Israel wants to expand their market, it may need to work through its Netanyahu disaster period, and elect a Labor government with center-right instead of far-right social and economic policy, and policy on Palestine. All of this is entirely speculative, and probably unlikely. But Israel needs this project more than the other parties need Israel. Israel will need to weigh, however, numerous factors which not only directly relate to energy markets. In reality, Israel finds itself increasingly isolated in the region. Experts have already explained for at least a decade, that the Israeli Zionist project may be unsustainable and could be winding down. Some have even pondered if the Zionist entity would be looking to relocate to the emerging rump-state of Western Ukraine, where, biblical lore aside, many Israelis can materially trace their recent history to. Nevertheless, Israel has reached a critical place, and has some difficult decisions to make.\n\nIsrael is going to be the most problematic piece, but the Azeris also have an opportunity to re-align their interests with the new plan. The fusion of Nabucco and South Stream with TANAP/TAP is still a possibility too. BP will not like this per se, but the Shah Deniz consortium is going to have to make some difficult decisions and work that piece out. This is doubly true if there is a serious policy change in Azerbaijan. Like with Israel, the Azeris need to be a part of this project more than the project needs them.\n\nThe Azeri\u2019s only other option is the ever elusive White Stream. Yulia Tymoshenko herself proposed this to the EU as far back as 2008. There are numerous problems here, including that it was to cross from Georgia into the Black Sea and to Crimea. But Crimea is Russia now, and at present time it is truly up in the air if Ukraine will become a landlocked rump-state, or have regime change, long before such a project can be completed, let alone started. Romania, which has been removed from the Russian-Turkish proposal in its Nabucco form, may be the only viable partner. But this would mean extensive construction across the black sea from Georgia to Romania. These were the same obstacles which precluded the possibility of any kind of TANAP/TAP project that didn\u2019t go through Turkey. In reality, if a project cannot pay by itself for a relatively limited supply (Azeri) to traverse the Black Sea, it will have to work with Russia or Turkey, who have now teamed up.\n\nWith regard to the entire scope of the Russian-Turkish gas deal in general, we should be cautious in speculating much on the future course of it, or what it all may mean. We have attempted to sketch out what some of the primary factors are. We have given some details and the related background, of the natural gas contest and its primacy not only to Russia and Ukraine, and the Balkans. We have explained also how this collided and yet now coincides with a Turkish supported project.\n\nWe should still expect future public talk on this subject which places the new deal into question. This is all part of the process and the spectacle. It is even still possible that Israel will provoke such a response in Syria and Lebanon that Iran will be hard pressed not to react, increasing the bellicosity and instability in the region, making a Turkish re-orientation of the Southern Corridor more difficult.\n\nLikewise, the West may still effectively divide Russian from Turkish interests. It will definitely make every attempt to. The Russians and Turks, if they are to stay together on this project, will likely entertain the illusion for the West that its disruptive efforts are working at times, because this is how it\u2019s done.\n\nIt made little sense for Russia and Turkey to both have lines through roughly the same route, with the success of the Turkish one requiring instability in the Levant, the destruction of Syria, and a coup in Egypt. Now that Russia and Turkey have announced to the world that they will not have their interests placed at odds with each other through the manipulation of the US, EU, and Israel, we can see a geopolitical shift in the making, of tectonic proportions.\n\nAgain, this is not over for Bulgaria either, but as with Bosnia and Serbia, the conflict in Ukraine stands a good chance at spreading, especially as Balkans states could re-align in a decisively pro-Russian direction. Still, energy markets are huge, but they are not everything.\n\nRussia\u2019s future tasks are clear. If Bulgaria can come to its senses, Russia must help Bulgaria with its security apparatus, for example, helping to restructure its intelligence and secret police agencies. It must provide Bulgaria with these and other assurances. Russia must also, if is to build again with the EU, demonstrate that it can protect assets and investments in Latin America.\n\nEurope must understand that the Balkans can only be a place where either both EU, Russia and Turkey can have an interest, or that it will be without Europe, with only Russia and Turkey having an interest. This would mirror an historical pattern, as well.\n\nThe EU should not be forced to commit suicide by cutting off its access to affordable energy resources from Russia and the Middle-East, at the threat of losing access to Latin American markets under conditions of increased US bellicosity in that region.\n\nSome analysts have looked at the low prices and attractive terms which Russia have offered to its partners, including China, and now Turkey and India, regarding energy markets. Some have said that Putin is showing Russian weakness with such a low price. Others, more accurately have said that Putin is broad in thinking, and is focusing more on market share than market price. This is a fair point, and closer to the truth.\n\nBut all of these exciting adventures in capitalism are not going to mean very much on an irradiated earth primarily populated by cockroaches, feeding off of highly adaptive bacteria. The bigger picture we can draw from all of this is a Russia that is thinking long term, and issues like stability are more important than quarterly fluctuations. It is committed to building a multi-polar world which will save the world from the US Empire, save Europe from itself, and enable conditions for sovereignty and development in whole regions like the Balkans, Middle-east, Africa, Asia, and Latin America.\n\nJoaquin Flores is an American expat living in Belgrade.

Democrat Aligned Washington Post Claims Roy Moore Had Inappropriate Relations With Teenagers\n\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\n\nHeadline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!\n\nIn what the entire mainstream media machine is calling a bombshell report, the openly Democrat aligned Washington Post has published an explosive piece that claims that the Republican nominee for a Senate seat in Alabama, Judge Roy Moore, had a series of inappropriate relationships with teenagers some 34 years ago.\n\nThe alleged incidents took place between 1977 and 1982 and range from asking a 16-year-old girl out to supposedly touching a 14-year-old, all of which Moore has strongly denied.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post:\n\nIt was early 1979 and Moore \u2014 now the Republican nominee in Alabama for a U.S. Senate seat\u2014 was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney. He struck up a conversation, Corfman and her mother say, and offered to watch the girl while her mother went inside for a child custody hearing. \u201cHe said, \u2018Oh, you don\u2019t want her to go in there and hear all that. I\u2019ll stay out here with her,\u2019 \u201d says Corfman\u2019s mother, Nancy Wells, 71. \u201cI thought, how nice for him to want to take care of my little girl.\u201d Alone with Corfman, Moore chatted with her and asked for her phone number, she says. Days later, she says, he picked her up around the corner from her house in Gadsden, drove her about 30 minutes to his home in the woods, told her how pretty she was and kissed her. On a second visit, she says, he took off her shirt and pants and removed his clothes. He touched her over her bra and underpants, she says, and guided her hand to touch him over his underwear. \u201cI wanted it over with \u2014 I wanted out,\u201d she remembers thinking. \u201cPlease just get this over with. Whatever this is, just get it over.\u201d Corfman says she asked Moore to take her home, and he did. [\u2026] Aside from Corfman, three other women interviewed by The Washington Post in recent weeks say Moore pursued them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18 and he was in his early 30s, episodes they say they found flattering at the time, but troubling as they got older. None of the three women say that Moore forced them into any sort of relationship or sexual contact. Wendy Miller says she was 14 and working as a Santa\u2019s helper at the Gadsden Mall when Moore first approached her, and 16 when he asked her on dates, which her mother forbade. Debbie Wesson Gibson says she was 17 when Moore spoke to her high school civics class and asked her out on the first of several dates that did not progress beyond kissing. Gloria Thacker Deason says she was an 18-year-old cheerleader when Moore began taking her on dates that included bottles of Mateus Ros\u00e9 wine. The legal drinking age in Alabama was 19. Of the four women, the youngest at the time was Corfman, who is the only one who says she had sexual contact with Moore that went beyond kissing. She says they did not have intercourse.\n\nInterestingly, Breitbart News actually scooped the story from The Post, publishing an article about their upcoming report hours before it was actually released.\n\n\u201cBreitbart News obtained details of the forthcoming Post story from the newspaper\u2019s letter detailing the allegations sent to Moore\u2019s campaign for comment.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Moore flatly denied the allegations and noted that this was a hit job by the Democrats and their allies at the Post.\n\n\u201cThese allegations are completely false and are a desperate political attack by the National Democrat Party and the Washington Post on this campaign.\u201d \u201cThis garbage is the very definition of fake news and intentional defamation,\u201d he continued.\n\nThe statement also noted that Moore has been in politics for decades and that if these allegations were true they would have came out already.\n\nThe Judge has been a candidate in four hotly-contested statewide political contests, twice as a gubernatorial candidate and twice as a candidate for chief justice. He has been a three-time candidate for local office, and he has been a national figure in two ground-breaking, judicial fights over religious liberty and traditional marriage.\n\nAmazingly, establishment Republicans, led by Rhino Mitch McConnell, are already taking the report as gospel and attacking both Moore and Breitbart News for supposedly \u201cdefending\u201d him.\n\nWell that didn\u2019t take long\u2026\n\nIt is also important to note that the reporters who published The Washington Post piece have a history of anti-Trump sentiment while The Post itself endorsed the Democrat who is going up against the highly popular Moore.\n\nSo what do you think?\n\nWill these allegations turn out to be true or is this simply a disgusting attempt to piggyback off the Harvey Weinstein allegations and take out Judge Roy Moore before he wins the election?\n\nThis article has been contributed by SHTF Plan.

T he British memo recounted a July 23, 2002, meeting in which Richard Dearlove, chief of the British intelligence agency MI6, told Prime Minister Tony Blair about discussions in Washington with George W. Bush's top national security officials. \u201cBush wanted to remove Saddam, through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD. But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy,\u201d Dearlove said, according to the minutes. After the \u201cDowning Street Memo\u201d was revealed in Great Britain in 2005, Bush's spokesmen heatedly denied its claims and major U.S. news outlets dismissed its significance . But i n the upcoming issue of Foreign Affairs magazine, Pillar offers a matching account. He wrote that the administration didn't just play games with the traditional notion that objective analysis should inform responsible policy, but \u201c turned the entire model upside down. \u201d \u201cThe administration used intelligence not to inform decision-making, but to justify a decision already made,\u201d Pillar wrote. \u201cThe Bush administration deviated from the professional standard not only in using policy to drive intelligence, but also in aggressively using intelligence to win public support for its decision to go to war. This meant selectively adducing data -- 'cherry-picking' -- rather than using the intelligence community's own analytic judgments.\u201d These two accounts -- which are further bolstered by first-hand statements from former counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke, former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Colin Powell's former chief of staff Lawrence Wilkerson -- reveal an administration long determined to invade Iraq and assembling reasons that would scare the American people into supporting an unprovoked war. Yet, while the American public has a right to be furious about getting tricked into a war that has killed nearly 2,300 U.S. soldiers and tens of thousands of Iraqis, there are other concerns about why the U.S. intelligence community let itself be so manipulated, staying silent when a strong protest to Congress might have derailed Bush's scheme. On Oct. 23, 2003, Consortiumnews.com addressed this longer-range question of why U.S. intelligence failed. That story, which is reprinted in an updated form below, shows that the politicization of intelligence has been a goal of neoconservative operatives for three decades. They have long understood the value of turning the principle of objective analysis on its head: I n Tom Clancy\u2019s political thriller \u201cSum of All Fears,\u201d the United States and Russia are being pushed to the brink of nuclear war by neo-Nazi terrorists who have detonated a nuclear explosion in Baltimore and want the Americans to blame the Russians. CIA analysts have pieced together the real story but can\u2019t get it to the president. \u201cThe president is basing his decisions on some really bad information,\u201d analyst Jack Ryan (Ben Affleck) pleads to a U.S. general. \u201cMy orders are to get the right information to the people who make the decisions.\u201d Though a bit corny, Ryan\u2019s dialogue captures the credo of professional intelligence analysts. Solid information, they believe, must be the foundation for sound decisions, especially when lives and the national security are at stake. The battle over that principle is the real back story to the dispute over Iraq\u2019s alleged weapons of mass destruction. It is a story of how the CIA\u2019s vaunted analytical division has been corrupted \u2013 or \u201cpoliticized\u201d \u2013 by right-wing ideologues over the past quarter century. Some key officials in George W. Bush\u2019s administration \u2013 from former Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz to Vice President Dick Cheney \u2013 have long been part of this trend toward seeing intelligence as an ideological weapon, rather than a way to inform a full debate. Other figures in Bush\u2019s circle of advisers, including his father, the former president and CIA director, have played perhaps even more central roles in this transformation. [More on this below. Also see Robert Parry's Secrecy & Privilege.] For his part, the younger George Bush has shown little but disdain for any information that puts his policies or \u201cgut\u201d judgments in a negative light. In that sense, Bush\u2019s thin skin toward contradiction can\u2019t be separated from the White House campaign, beginning in July 2003, to discredit retired Ambassador Joseph Wilson for publicly debunking the Bush administration\u2019s claim that Iraq had tried to buy yellowcake uranium from Niger. That retaliation included the exposure of Wilson\u2019s wife as an undercover CIA officer. Dating Back to Watergate Though one cost of corrupting U.S. intelligence can now be counted in the growing U.S. death toll in Iraq, the origins of the current problem can be traced back to the mid-1970s, when conservatives were engaged in fierce rear-guard defenses after the twin debacles of the Vietnam War and Watergate. In 1974, after Republican President Richard Nixon was driven from office over the Watergate political-spying scandal, the Republicans suffered heavy losses in congressional races. The next year, the U.S. \u2013backed government in South Vietnam fell. At this crucial juncture, a group of influential conservatives coalesced around a strategy of accusing the CIA\u2019s analytical division of growing soft on communism. These conservatives \u2013 led by the likes of Richard Pipes, Paul Nitze, William Van Cleave, Max Kampelman, Eugene Rostow, Elmo Zumwalt and Richard Allen \u2013 claimed that the CIA\u2019s Soviet analysts were ignoring Moscow\u2019s aggressive strategy for world domination. This political assault put in play one of the CIA\u2019s founding principles \u2013 objective analysis. Since its creation in 1947, the CIA had taken pride in maintaining an analytical division that stayed above the political fray. The CIA analysts \u2013 confident if not arrogant about their intellectual skills \u2013 prided themselves in bringing unwanted news to the president\u2019s door. Those reports included an analysis of Soviet missile strength that contradicted John F. Kennedy\u2019s \u201cmissile gap\u201d rhetoric or the debunking of Lyndon Johnson\u2019s assumptions about the effectiveness of bombing in Vietnam. While the CIA\u2019s operational division got itself into trouble with risky schemes, the analytical division maintained a fairly good record of scholarship and objectivity. But that tradition came under attack in 1976 when conservative outsiders demanded and were granted access to the CIA\u2019s strategic intelligence on the Soviet Union. Their goal was to contest the analytical division\u2019s assessments of Soviet capabilities and intentions. The conservatives saw the CIA\u2019s tempered analysis of Soviet behavior as the underpinning of then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger\u2019s strategy of d\u00e9tente, the gradual normalizing of relations with the Soviet Union. D\u00e9tente was, in effect, a plan to negotiate an end to the Cold War or at least its most dangerous elements. This CIA view of a tamer Soviet Union had enemies inside Gerald Ford\u2019s administration. Hard-liners, such as William J. Casey, John Connally, Clare Booth Luce and Edward Teller, sat on the President\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. Another young hard-liner, Dick Cheney, was Ford\u2019s chief of staff. Donald Rumsfeld was then \u2013 as he is today \u2013 the secretary of defense. Team B The concept of a conservative counter-analysis, which became known as \u201cTeam B,\u201d had been opposed by the previous CIA director, William Colby, as in inappropriate intrusion into the integrity of the CIA\u2019s analytical product. But the new CIA director, a politically ambitious George H.W. Bush, was ready to acquiesce to the right-wing pressure. \u201cAlthough his top analysts argued against such an undertaking, Bush checked with the White House, obtained an O.K., and by May 26 [1976] signed off on the experiment with the notation, \u2018Let her fly!!,\u201d wrote Anne Hessing Cahn after reviewing \u201cTeam B\u201d documents that were released more than a decade ago. [See \u201cTeam B: The Trillion Dollar Experiment,\u201d The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.] The senior George Bush offered the rationale that Team B would simply be an intellectual challenge to the CIA\u2019s official assessments. The elder Bush\u2019s rationale, however, assumed that Team B didn\u2019t have a pre-set agenda to fashion a worst-case scenario for launching a new and intensified Cold War. What was sometimes called Cold War II would demand hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayers\u2019 money for military projects, including big-ticket items like a missile-defense system. [One member of Team B, retired Lt. Gen. Daniel Graham, would become the father of Ronald Reagan \u201cStar Wars\u201d missile defense system.] Not surprisingly, Team B did produce a worst-case scenario of Soviet power and intentions. Gaining credibility from its access to secret CIA data, Team B challenged the assessment of the CIA\u2019s professional analysts who held a less alarmist view of Moscow\u2019s capabilities and intentions. \u201cThe principal threat to our nation, to world peace and to the cause of human freedom is the Soviet drive for dominance based upon an unparalleled military buildup,\u201d wrote three Team B members Pipes, Nitze and Van Cleave. Team B also brought to prominence another young neo-conservative, Paul Wolfowitz. A quarter century later, Wolfowitz would pioneer the post-Cold War strategy of U.S. preemptive wars against countries deemed potential threats by using the same technique of filtering the available intelligence to build a worst-case scenario. In 2001, George W. Bush made Wolfowitz deputy secretary of defense under Rumsfeld. Though Team B\u2019s analysis of the Soviet Union as a rising power on the verge of overwhelming the United States is now recognized by intelligence professionals and many historians as a ludicrous fantasy, it helped shape the national security debate in the late 1970s. American conservatives and neo-conservatives wielded the analysis like a club to bludgeon more moderate Republicans and Democrats, who saw a declining Soviet Union desperate for arms control and other negotiations. Reagan's Rise Scary assessments of Soviet power and U.S. weakness also fueled Ronald Reagan\u2019s campaign in 1980, and after his election, the Team B hard-liners had the keys to power. As Reagan and his vice presidential running mate, George H.W. Bush, prepared to take office, the hard-liners wrote Reagan\u2019s transition team report, which suggested that the CIA analytical division was not simply obtuse in its supposed failure to perceive Soviet ascendancy, but treasonous. \u201cThese failures are of such enormity,\u201d the transition team report said, \u201cthat they cannot help but suggest to any objective observer that the agency itself is compromised to an unprecedented extent and that its paralysis is attributable to causes more sinister than incompetence.\u201d [For details, see Mark Perry\u2019s Eclipse.] With Reagan in power, the Team B analysis of Soviet capabilities and intentions became the basis for a massive U.S. military buildup. It also was the justification for U.S. support of brutal right-wing governments in Central America and elsewhere. Since Soviet power was supposedly on the rise and rapidly eclipsing the United States, it followed that even peasant uprisings against \u201cdeath squad\u201d regimes in El Salvador or Guatemala must be part of a larger Soviet strategy of world conquest, an assault on the \u201csoft underbelly\u201d of the U.S. southern border. Any analysis of these civil wars as primarily local conflicts arising from long-standing social grievances was dismissed as fuzzy thinking or worse. In the first few months of the Reagan administration, the hard-liners\u2019 animosity toward the CIA\u2019s analytical division intensified as it resisted a series of accusations against the Soviet Union. The CIA analysts were obstacles to the administration\u2019s campaign to depict Moscow as responsible for virtually all acts of international terrorism, including the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II in Rome in 1981. With William Casey installed as CIA director and also serving in Reagan\u2019s Cabinet, the assault on the analytical division moved into high gear. Casey put the analytical division under the control of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Robert Gates, who had made his name as an anti-Soviet hard-liner. Gates then installed a new bureaucracy within the DI, or Directorate of Intelligence, with his loyalists in key positions. \u201cThe CIA\u2019s objectivity on the Soviet Union ended abruptly in 1981, when Casey became the DCI [director of central intelligence] \u2013 and the first one to be a member of the president\u2019s Cabinet. Gates became Casey\u2019s deputy director for intelligence in 1982 and chaired the National Intelligence Council,\u201d wrote former CIA senior analyst Melvyn Goodman. [See Foreign Policy magazine, summer 1997.] Analysts Under Fire Under Gates, CIA intelligence analysts found themselves the victims of bureaucratic pummeling. According to several former CIA analysts whom I interviewed, analysts faced job threats; some were berated or even had their analytical papers thrown in their faces; some were subjected to allegations of psychiatric unfitness. The Gates leadership team proved itself responsive to White House demands, giving serious attention to right-wing press reports from around the world. The Reagan administration, for instance, wanted evidence to support right-wing media claims that pinned European terrorism on the Soviets. The CIA analysts, however, knew the charges were bogus partly because they were based on \u201cblack\u201d or false propaganda that the CIA's operations division had been planting in the European media. The attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II in 1981 was viewed as another opportunity to make propaganda points against what Reagan called the \u201cevil empire.\u201d Though the attack had been carried out by a neo-fascist extremist from Turkey, conservative U.S. writers and journalists began to promote allegations of a secret KGB role. In this case, CIA analysts knew the charges were false because of the CIA\u2019s penetration of East Bloc intelligence services. But responding to White House pressure in 1985, Gates closeted a special team to push through an administration-desired paper linking the KGB to the attack. Though the analysts opposed what they believed to be a dishonest intelligence report, they couldn\u2019t stop the paper from leaving CIA and being circulated around Washington. As the CIA\u2019s traditions of analytical objectivity continued to erode in the 1980s, analysts who raised unwelcome questions in politically sensitive areas found their jobs on the line. For instance, analysts were pressured to back off an assessment that Pakistan was violating nuclear proliferation safeguards with the goal of building an atomic bomb. At the time, Pakistan was assisting the Reagan administration\u2019s covert operation in Afghanistan, which was considered a higher priority than stopping the spread of nuclear weapons. In Afghanistan, the CIA\u2019s operations division and the Pakistani intelligence service were helping Islamic fundamentalists, including Osama bin Laden, battle Soviet troops. One analyst involved in the Pakistan nuclear-bomb assessment told me that the CIA higher-ups applied almost the opposite standards that were used two decades later in alleging an Iraqi nuclear program. In the Pakistani case, the Reagan administration blocked warnings about a Pakistani bomb \u201cuntil the last bolt was turned\u201d while more recently on Iraq, speculative worst-case scenarios were applied, the analyst said. One consequence of giving Pakistan a pass on proliferation was that Pakistan did succeed in developing nuclear weapons, which have contributed to an escalating arms race with India in South Asia. It also has created the potential for Islamic extremists to gain control of the Bomb by taking power in Pakistan. Missing the Fall The politicization of intelligence in the 1980s had other effects. Under pressure always to exaggerate the Soviet threat, analysts had no incentive to point out the truth, which was that the Soviet Union was a decaying, corrupt and inefficient regime tottering on the brink of collapse. To justify soaring military budgets and interventions in Third World conflicts, the Reagan administration wanted the Soviets always to be depicted as 10 feet tall. Ironically, this systematic distortion of the CIA\u2019s Soviet intelligence assessments turned out to be a political win-win for Reagan and his supporters. Not only did Congress appropriate hundreds of billions of dollars for military projects favored by the conservatives, the U.S. news media largely gave Reagan the credit when the Soviet Union \u201csuddenly\u201d collapsed in 1991. The CIA did take some lumps for \u201cmissing\u201d one of the most significant political events of the century, but Reagan\u2019s success in \u201cwinning the Cold War\u201d is now enshrined as conventional wisdom. The accepted version of events goes this way: the Soviets were on the ascendance before Reagan took office, but thanks to Reagan\u2019s strategic missile defense program and his support for right-wing insurgencies, such as arming contra rebels in Nicaragua and Islamic fundamentalists in Afghanistan, the Soviet Union fell apart. A more realistic assessment would point out that the Soviets had been in decline for decades, largely from the devastation caused by World War II and the effective containment strategies followed by presidents from Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower to Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. The rapid development of technology in the West and the lure of Western consumer goods accelerated this Soviet collapse. But the U.S. news media never mounted a serious assessment of how the Cold War really was won. The conservative press corps naturally pressed its favored theme of Reagan turning the tide, while a complacent mainstream press offered little additional context. 'Politicization' The plight of the CIA analysts in the 1980s also received little attention in Washington amid the triumphalism of the early 1990s. The story did surface briefly in 1991 during Gates\u2019s confirmation hearings to become President George H.W. Bush\u2019s CIA director. Then, a group of CIA analysts braved the administration\u2019s wrath by protesting the \u201cpoliticization of intelligence.\u201d Led by Soviet specialist Mel Goodman, the dissidents fingered Gates as the key \u201cpoliticization\u201d culprit. Their testimony added to doubts about Gates, who was under a cloud for his dubious testimony on the Iran-Contra scandal and allegations that he had played a role in another covert scheme to assist Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq. But the elder George Bush lined up solid Republican backing and enough accommodating Democrats \u2013 particularly Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren \u2013 to push Gates through. Boren\u2019s key staff aide who limited the investigation of Gates was George Tenet, whose behind-the-scenes maneuvering on Gates\u2019s behalf won the personal appreciation of the senior George Bush. Those political chits would serve Tenet well a decade later when the younger George Bush protected Tenet as his own CIA director, even after the intelligence failure of Sept. 11, 2001, and embarrassing revelations about faulty intelligence on Iraq\u2019s WMD. In the early 1990s. with the Cold War over, the need for objective intelligence also seemed less pressing. Political leaders apparently didn\u2019t grasp the potential danger of allowing a corrupted U.S. intelligence process to remain in place. There was a brief window for action with Bill Clinton\u2019s election in 1992, but the incoming Democrats lacked the political will to demand serious reform. The \u201cpoliticization\u201d issue was put squarely before Clinton\u2019s incoming national security team by former CIA analyst Peter Dickson, who wrote a two-page memo on Dec. 10, 1992, to Samuel \u201cSandy\u201d Berger, a top Clinton national security aide. Dickson was an analyst who suffered retaliation after refusing to rewrite a 1983 assessment that noted Soviet restraint on nuclear proliferation. His CIA superiors didn\u2019t want to give the Soviets any credit for demonstrating caution on the nuclear technology front. When Dickson stood by his evidence, he soon found himself facing accusations about his psychological fitness. Dickson urged Clinton to appoint a new CIA director who understood \u201cthe deeper internal problems relating to the politicization of intelligence and the festering morale problem within the CIA.\u201d In urging a housecleaning, Dickson wrote, \u201cThis problem of intellectual corruption will not disappear overnight, even with vigorous remedial action. However, the new CIA director will be wise if he realizes from the start the dangers in relying on advice of senior CIA office managers who during the past 12 years advanced and prospered in their careers precisely because they had no qualms about suppressing intelligence or slanting analysis to suit the interest of Casey and Gates.\u201d The appeals from Dickson and other CIA veterans were largely ignored by Clinton and his top aides, who were more interested in turning around the U.S. economy and enacting some modest social programs. Although Gates was removed as CIA director, Clinton appointed James Woolsey, a neo-conservative Democrat who had worked closely with the Reagan-Bush administrations. Under Woolsey and Clinton\u2019s subsequent CIA directors, the Gates team sans Gates consolidated its bureaucratic power. The old ideal of intelligence analysis free from political taint was never restored. Clinton\u2019s final CIA director was George Tenet, who was kept on by George W. Bush in 2001. In violation of the CIA\u2019s long-standing tradition of avoiding even the appearance of partisanship, Tenet happily presided over the ceremony that renamed the CIA\u2019s Langley, Va., headquarters the George Bush Center for Intelligence, after George Bush senior. The Iraq Debacle Tenet also has proved himself a loyal bureaucrat to the second Bush administration. For instance, in February 2003 when Secretary of State Colin Powell addressed the United Nations Security Council about Iraq\u2019s alleged WMD program, Tenet was prominently seated behind Powell, giving the CIA\u2019s imprimatur to Powell\u2019s assertions that turned out to be a mixture of unproved assertions, exaggerations and outright lies. At one point in his speech, Powell even altered the text of intercepted conversations between Iraqi officials to make their comments appear incriminating. [For details, see Consortiumnews.com\u2019s \"Bush's Alderaan.\"] \u201cIf one goes back to that very long presentation [by Powell], point by point, one finds that this was not a very honest explanation,\u201d said Greg Thielmann, a former senior official in the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Intelligence and Research, in an interview with PBS Frontline. \u201cI have to conclude Secretary Powell was being a loyal secretary of state, a \u2018good soldier\u2019 as it were, building the administration\u2019s case before the international community.\u201d [For details, see Frontline\u2019s \u201cTruth, War and Consequences.\u201d] In the Foreign Affairs article, Pillar noted that Powell's U.N. speech also compromised the objectivity of the CIA on Iraq because \u201c the intelligence community was pulled over the line into policy advocacy -- not so much by what it said as by its conspicuous role in the administration's public case for war. This was especially true when the intelligence community was made highly visible (with the director of central intelligence literally in the camera frame) in [Powell's] intelligence-laden presentation. \u201d Pillar added that the CIA also was compromised \u201c in the fall of 2002, when, at the administration's behest, the intelligence community published a white paper on Iraq's WMD programs -- but without including any of the community's judgments about the likelihood of those weapons' being used. \u201d Though Tenet\u2019s primary responsibility should have been to the integrity of the intelligence product, he was helping Powell and the White House present a largely bogus case before the U.N. After the March 2003 invasion, as the case for Iraq\u2019s possession of trigger-ready WMD fell apart, the Washington debate turned to who was at fault for the shoddy intelligence. In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on June 25, 2003, Army Lt. Gen. John Abizaid offered a clue when he compared the accuracy of tactical intelligence in the Iraq war versus the faulty strategic intelligence. \u201cIntelligence was the most accurate that I have ever seen on the tactical level, probably the best I\u2019ve ever seen on the operational level, and perplexingly incomplete on the strategic level with regard to weapons of mass destruction,\u201d said Abizaid, who heads the U.S. Central Command, which is responsible for Iraq. In other words, the intelligence handled by low-level personnel was excellent. It was the intelligence that went through senior levels of the Bush administration that failed. The WMD issue really came down to two questions: Was the CIA\u2019s intelligence analysis that bad or did the White House cherry-pick the intelligence that it wanted to march the country off to war? The answer appears to be that both points were true. A thoroughly politicized CIA slanted the intelligence in the direction that Bush wanted and the White House then trimmed off any caveats the CIA may have included. The CIA\u2019s internal complaint that it was just the victim of administration ideologues was undercut by its own analytical products, including a post-invasion report claiming that two captured Iraqi trailers were labs to produce chemical or biological weapons. That claim later collapsed as evidence emerged to show that the labs were for making hydrogen for artillery weather balloons. [For an early critique of this CIA report, see Consortiumnews.com\u2019s \"America's Matrix.\"] Plus, while Tenet and other CIA officials noted that they objected to other bogus administration claims, such as the assertion that Iraq was seeking yellowcake uranium from Niger, those protests were mostly half-hearted and made behind closed doors. Bush was only forced to back off the yellowcake claim, which he cited in his 2003 State of the Union Address, after former Ambassador Wilson went public with evidence that the allegation was a fraud. 'Stovepipe' Yet it's also true that the Bush administration didn't want to chance having its Iraqi WMD allegations vetted by any serious intelligence professionals. So, at the State Department, Pentagon and White House, senior political officials created their own channels for accessing raw or untested intelligence that was then used to buttress the charges. In a New Yorker article about CIA analysts on the defensive, journalist Seymour Hersh described this \u201cstovepiping\u201d process of sending raw intelligence to the top. Intelligence agencies have historically objected to this technique because policy makers will tend to select unvetted information that serves their purposes and use it to discredit the more measured assessments of intelligence professionals. \u201cThe analysts at the CIA were beaten down defending their assessments,\u201d a former CIA official told Hersh. \u201cAnd they blame Tenet for not protecting them. I\u2019ve never seen a government like this.\u201d [See Hersh\u2019s \u201cThe Stovepipe,\u201d The New Yorker, Oct. 27, 2003] Pillar wrote that the battle between the intelligence analysts and the policymakers came to a head over the White House desire to assert that Saddam Hussein was connected to al-Qaeda, a claim that the intelligence analysts had rejected despite repetitious demands from Vice President Cheney's office that the CIA corroborate the supposed link. \u201c The administration's rejection of the intelligence community's judgments became especially clear with the formation of a special Pentagon unit, the Policy Counterterrorism Evaluation Group, \u201d Pillar wrote. \u201c The unit, which reported to Undersecretary of Defense Douglas Feith, was dedicated to finding every possible link between Saddam and al-Qaeda, and its briefing accused the intelligence community of faulty analysis for failing to see the supposed alliance. \u201d But the intelligence analysts weren\u2019t the only ones coming under attack for pointing out evidence that didn\u2019t conform to the Bush administration\u2019s propaganda. From the start of its drive to invade Iraq, the administration treated going to war like a giant public relations game, with the goal of manufacturing consent or at least silencing any meaningful opposition. Evidence that undermined Bush\u2019s conclusions was minimized or discarded. People who revealed unwanted evidence were personally discredited or intimidated. When former Ambassador Wilson reported that he had been assigned by the CIA to investigate the Niger yellowcake claims and found them bogus, administration officials leaked the fact that Wilson\u2019s wife, Valerie Plame, was an undercover CIA officer. The leak destroyed Plame's career and may have put at risk agents who worked with her. 'Slime and Defend' Though Bush publicly denounced the leak, an unnamed Republican aide on Capitol Hill told the New York Times that the underlying White House strategy was to \u201cslime and defend,\u201d that is to \u201cslime\u201d Wilson and \u201cdefend\u201d Bush. [NYT, Oct. 2, 2003] The \u201cslime and defend\u201d strategy has been carried forward by conservative news outlets with the Wall Street Journal editorial page and Rev. Sun Myung Moon\u2019s Washington Times attacking Wilson's motives, even as Wilson\u2019s debunking of the Niger allegations has been borne out by other investigations. \u201cJoseph C. Wilson IV, the man accusing the White House of a vendetta against his wife, is an ex-diplomat turned Democratic partisan,\u201d declared a front-page article in the Washington Times. \u201cMr. Wilson told the Washington Post he and his wife are already discussing who will play them in the movie.\u201d [Washington Times, Oct. 2, 2003] The Washington Times returned to its anti-Wilson campaign several days later. \u201cAs for Mr. Wilson himself, his hatred of Mr. Bush\u2019s policies borders on the pathological,\u201d wrote Washington Times columnist Donald Lambro on Oct. 6, 2003. \u201cThis is a far-left Democrat who has been relentlessly bashing the president\u2019s Iraq war policies. \u2026 The mystery behind this dubious investigation is why this Bush-hater was chosen for so sensitive a mission.\u201d The Wall Street Journal also raised questions about Wilson\u2019s motives. \u201cJoe Wilson (Ms. Plame\u2019s husband) has made no secret of his broad disagreement with Bush policy since outing himself with an op-ed,\u201d the Journal wrote in a lead editorial on Oct. 3, 2003. Strangely, these attacks on Wilson\u2019s alleged bias (which he denies) continued even as Bush\u2019s hand-picked Iraqi weapons inspector David Kay was confirming Wilson\u2019s findings. In his report to the CIA and Congress, Kay acknowledged that no evidence has been found to support the stories about Iraq seeking African uranium. \u201cTo date we have not uncovered evidence that Iraq undertook significant post-1998 steps to actually build nuclear weapons or produce fissile material,\u201d Kay said. The disconnect between fact and spin apparently has grown so complete among Bush\u2019s allies that they can\u2019t stop attacking Wilson\u2019s findings as biased even when the facts he uncovered are being confirmed by one of Bush\u2019s own investigators. The clumsy attempt to discredit or punish Wilson eventually led to disclosures that Bush's chief political adviser Karl Rove and Cheney's chief of staff Lewis Libby took part in revealing Plame's identity to reporters. In 2005, Libby was indicted on charges of obstructing justice and lying to investigators about the leak. Rove apparently remains under investigation. 'Freedom Fries' But the attacks on Wilson do not stand alone. In the drive to limit debate about Bush\u2019s case for war, his allies ostracized virtually all major critics of the administration\u2019s WMD claims, including the U.N.\u2019s chief weapons inspector Hans Blix and former U.N. weapons inspector Scott Ritter. Blacklisting campaigns also were mounted against celebrities, such as actor Sean Penn and the music group Dixie Chicks, for criticizing Bush\u2019s rush to war. When France urged more time for U.N. weapons inspections, Bush\u2019s supporters organized boycotts of French products, poured French wine in gutters and renamed \u201cFrench fries\u201d as \u201cFreedom Fries.\u201d As with the Wilson case, Bush and his supporters didn't let the failure to find the alleged trigger-ready WMD stop their efforts to discredit these critics. Instead of apologies, for instance, Ritter continued to suffer from conservative smears about his patriotism. In one particularly smarmy performance on June 12, 2003, Fox News anchor Bill O\u2019Reilly teamed up with Rep. Mike Pence, R-Ind., to air suspicions that Ritter had been bribed by the Iraqis to help them cover up their illegal weapons. Neither O\u2019Reilly nor Pence had any evidence that Ritter accepted a bribe, so they framed the segment as a demand that the FBI investigate Ritter with the purported goal of clearing him of any suspicion of treason. The segment noted that a London newspaper reporter had found Iraqi documents showing that Ritter had been offered some gold as gifts for his family. \u201cI turned down the gifts and reported it to the FBI when I came back,\u201d Ritter said in an interview with Fox News. Though Ritter\u2019s statement stood uncontradicted, O\u2019Reilly and Pence demanded that the FBI disclose what it knew about Ritter\u2019s denial. \u201cNow, we want to know whether that was true,\u201d said O\u2019Reilly about whether Ritter had reported the alleged bribe. \u201cThe FBI wouldn\u2019t tell us.\u201d O\u2019Reilly then asked Pence what he had done to get the FBI to investigate Ritter. \u201cAfter that report in the British newspaper, many of us on Capitol Hill were very concerned,\u201d Pence said. \u201cCandidly, Bill, there\u2019s no one who\u2019s done more damage to the argument of the United States that Iraq was in possession of large stores of weapons of mass destruction leading up to Operation Iraqi Freedom other than Scott Ritter, and so the very suggestion that \u2026 there\u2019s evidence of treasonous activity or even bribery, I believe, merits an investigation. I contacted the attorney general about that directly.\u201d Pence\u2019s point was clear \u2013 that Ritter\u2019s role as a skeptic about Bush\u2019s WMD claims made him an appropriate target for a treason investigation. [Fox News\u2019 \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor,\u201d June 12, 2003] Backward Filter Time and again, Bush and his administration have replaced the principle that good intelligence makes for good policy with the near-opposite approach: you start with a conclusion and then distort all available information to sell the pre-ordained policy to a gullible, ill-informed or frightened public. The WMD intelligence was pushed through a kind of backward filter. Instead of removing the imprecision that comes with raw intelligence, the Bush administration\u2019s intelligence process shoved through the dross as long as it fit with Bush\u2019s goal of bolstering political support for the war and removed the refined intelligence that undercut his desired actions. Unlike the fictional president in Tom Clancy's \u201cSum of All Fears\u201d \u2013 who was tricked into that \u201creally bad information\u201d \u2013 Bush and his team have actively sought out the bad information and assembled it as justification for going to war. This administration, which can sometimes act in a manner stranger-than-fiction, didn't just peer into the fog of war. It set up the fog machine.

It is in this vein that the reports which appeared in the pages of Western newspapers at the beginning of December stuffed with spy clich\u00e9s reminiscent of the cold war should be considered.\n\nThe tone was set by the London-based newspaper The Financial Times, which has revealed \u00abthe hand of Moscow\u00bb at the heart of the European Union. According to the newspaper, the mass demonstrations that swept across Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries in 2012-2013 against the development of shale gas deposits in Europe were paid for by Russia, or, to be more precise, by Gazprom. Similar allegations were also made by The New York Times. The reports\u2019 authors even mention the specific amounts that were allegedly paid by Russia, while at the same time acknowledging that the intelligence agencies of CEE countries have been unable to get any evidence to back up their claims.\n\nWestern newspapers focussed particular attention on demonstrations that had forced the American company Chevron to wind down its activities in Bulgaria, Romania and Lithuania. In point of fact, these demonstrations were on a massive scale and forced the Bulgarian and Romanian governments to terminate an agreement with the American oil company on the development of shale gas deposits. In Lithuania, the situation developed somewhat differently. There, Chevron experts refused to comply with Lithuania\u2019s tax demands, as well as finance the development of areas in which it was planning to carry out environmentally hazardous activities.\n\nPrior to that, the American company ExxonMobil also wound down all of its shale gas projects due to their inefficiency. The financial insolvency of these projects plus the environmental threat they created are what actually led to the poor outcome for Americans in these countries. The West, however, has decided to put forward a different version of events for the loss by American companies of a significant section of the market by declaring that the protests against shale gas projects in Bulgaria were the work of Russian agents. The same pro-Russian elements organised the resignation of Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov\u2019s government in 2013, to which end they financed the extreme right-wing ATAKA party. Although the specific reason for the anti-government protests was the then increase in utility bills, it is to be supposed that this was also paid for by Russia. According to Western newspapers, the total amount of payments received by Bulgaria was upwards of $20 million.\n\nRomania also cannot do without \u00abthe hand of Moscow\u00bb. The New York Times reports that Gazprom was involved in \u00aba mysteriously well-financed and well-organized campaign of protest\u00bb against shale gas projects in the country. Once again, however, the Romanian intelligence agencies admit that they do not have a single document proving Russia\u2019s involvement in the anti-fracking protests. The Romanian Parliament\u2019s industry committee does not have any evidence either, but claims that Gazprom allegedly spent $100 million to fund a campaign against the shale revolution in Europe. Nobody is able to clarify exactly where these figures have come from.\n\nIt is unsurprising that those who apparently received Russia\u2019s millions are categorically denying the accusations. Leaders of Bulgaria\u2019s ATAKA party stress that it is fully financed through state subsidies within the framework of national legislation. And as far as the leaders of the anti-fracking protests themselves are concerned, they view what is happening as an attempt to further the interests of American energy companies at any price.\n\nTellingly, the protests in Bulgaria, Romania and Lithuania broke out in 2012-2013, but \u00abthe hand of Moscow\u00bb is only being mentioned now, in the midst of increasingly strained discussions regarding Europe\u2019s energy security issues and America\u2019s shale gas projects, which, amid falling oil prices, are becoming less and less economically viable.\n\nThe position of opponents to the so-called shale revolution is also gaining ground in the US itself. According to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, \u00abone of the most remarkable results\u00bb of the US election campaign at the beginning of November was the outcome of the referendum held in the Texas city of Denton on the extraction of shale gas through fracking, hydraulic fracturing using chemicals, that American companies are also imposing on Europe. The majority of voters, 59 per cent, voted to ban the method as it causes considerable harm to the environment. Denton is located just a 45 minute drive away from the offices of America\u2019s largest oil company, ExxonMobil. It is also the location of America\u2019s largest shale gas deposit, Barnett Shale, where the shale revolution began in 1981. The area has 280 active wells [3].\n\nSo a very strong anti-fracking precedent has been established. Following the logic of The Financial Times and The New York Times, those against the extraction of shale gas in Texas were also no doubt financed by Russia.\n\nMeanwhile, the intergovernmental agreement signed in Moscow on the supply of Russian oil to Slovakia up until 2029 opened a new chapter in Russia\u2019s cooperation with CEE governments. Despite the seemingly unfavourable conditions in the world oil market, Moscow and Bratislava have taken an important step towards jointly ensuring Europe\u2019s energy security.\n\nThe document was signed by Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak and Slovak Economic Minister Pavol Pavlis. \u00abWe have no reason not to trust our Russian partner, which has always fulfilled its obligations\u00bb and is \u00aba reliable and long-term supplier with whom we work well,\u00bb commented Slovakia\u2019s Ministry of Economy upon signing the agreement with Russia. The ministry is convinced that Russian oil supplies are \u00abextremely important\u00bb for Slovakia, including from an engineering and manufacturing point of view: \u00abThe equipment at our refineries is tailored to the chemical and manufacturing makeup of Russian oil. So if we suddenly decided to export oil somewhere else, we would need to change the operating procedures at our refineries.\u00bb\n\nCooperation between Russia and Slovakia in the energy sector actually has a strong foundation, and they previously entered into a similar agreement in 1991. This was also of a long-term term nature and over the entire length of the agreement, neither Russia nor Slovakia were given any reason not to trust each other. The provisions of the new agreement extend the parameters of a bilateral cooperation. They stipulate a pronounced increase in the volumes of Russian oil supplies, both in the volumes of oil intended for Slovakia itself and the volumes of oil passing through Slovakia to other EU member countries. For both supply categories, the annual volume has been set at 6 million tons. As of year-end 2013, 5.8 million tons of Russian oil had been supplied to Slovakia through the Druzhba pipeline. Both parties agreed that if the technological infrastructure is available and contracts are entered into between businesses, then transit volumes could exceed 6 million tons of oil a year.\n\nThe signing of such long-term agreements in the energy sphere inevitably raises two questions, the first on the resource base and the second on the possible fluctuations in oil prices. When it comes to long-term supply sources in Slovakia and other EU countries, then they are safeguarded by oil reserves in Russia. And as far as fluctuations in oil prices are concerned, then experience has shown that they are cyclical in nature. If you recalculate the prices according to the current dollar exchange rate, for example, then it turns out that they were $100-110 per barrel not only fairly recently, but also at the beginning of the 1980s and even in the 1860s. Thus the market has successfully regained the falls in prices throughout the whole of the last century and a half.\n\nThe soundness of long-term contracts for the supply of Russian oil to Europe is also backed up by independent analysts. Experts from the British company BP have calculated that oil production in Russia will have grown to 548 million tons a year by 2035 (it is currently in the region of 520 million tons). Gas production in Russia will also increase \u2013 to 807 billion cubic metres a year (currently around 672 billion cubic metres).\n\nEuropean players in the gas market are looking for ways to expand their energy cooperation with Russia, despite attempts by the European Commission to sabotage their aspirations. The Slovak gas transmission system operator Eustream is planning to build a pipeline from Slovakia to the Bulgarian-Turkish border, so is hurrying to join a new plan for the transportation of Russian gas to Europe through Turkey. It is the first specific consequence of revised plans to build the South Stream pipeline...\n\n(To be concluded...)\n\n[1] The Financial Times, 01.12.2014\n\n[2] The New York Times, 01.12.2014\n\n[3] Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 06.11.104\n\nFoto: dailysabah.com", "domain": "www.strategic-culture.org", "label": 0, "url": "https://www.strategic-culture.org/pview/2014/12/13/south-stream-2-energy-wars-continue-i.html"}

Bush has assured Americans that they can relax about his warrantless wiretapping because the program is reviewed by lots of lawyers and intelligence professionals. What he doesn\u2019t say is that officials who object too much find themselves isolated, ridiculed and pushed out of their jobs. For instance, when Deputy Attorney General James Comey refused to recertify the spying program in March 2004 \u2013 while Attorney General John Ashcroft was in the hospital \u2013 Bush gave Comey a derisive nickname, as \u201cCuomey\u201d or \u201cCuomo\u201d after New York\u2019s former liberal Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo, Newsweek has reported. Similarly, a high-ranking intelligence official who questioned the wiretapping program told the Washington Post that his objections soon made him an unwanted outsider. He encountered awkward silences when he attended meetings where the eavesdropping rules were discussed. \u201cI became aware at some point of things I was not being told about,\u201d the intelligence official said. [Washington Post, Feb. 5, 2006] Another outcast from the Bush administration\u2019s clique of insiders was Assistant Attorney General Jack Goldsmith, who reportedly led an internal rebellion of Justice Department lawyers who protested Bush\u2019s assertion of nearly unlimited presidential powers for the duration of the War on Terror. \u201cDemanding that the White House stop using what they saw as farfetched rationales for riding rough-shod over the law and the Constitution, Goldsmith and the others fought to bring government spying and interrogation methods within the law,\u201d Newsweek wrote. \u201cThey did so at their peril; ostracized, some were denied promotions, while others left for more comfortable climes in private law firms and academia.\u201d White House Nerves Goldsmith \u2013 a Republican conservative but not a believer in the absolutist Presidency \u2013 started getting on the White House\u2019s nerves in fall 2003 after taking over the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC). First, Goldsmith argued that Iraqi prisoners were protected by the Geneva Conventions and couldn\u2019t be subjected to coercion. Then, Goldsmith challenged a legal memo that had supported Bush\u2019s right to authorize torture. Vice President Dick Cheney\u2019s chief counsel David Addington addressed Goldsmith with dripping sarcasm, accusing him of undermining the powers of the President, Newsweek reported in its Feb. 6, 2006, edition. \u201cNow that you\u2019ve withdrawn legal opinions that the President of the United States has been relying on,\u201d Addington reportedly told Goldsmith, \u201cI need you to go through all of OLC\u2019s opinions (relating to the War on Terror) and let me know which ones you still stand by.\u201d Goldsmith\u2019s opposition to Bush\u2019s program for warrantless wiretapping of Americans brought the tensions to a head. He drew support from Comey, who refused to sign a recertification of the wiretap program in March 2004 when he was filling in for ailing Attorney General Ashcroft. White House chief of staff Andrew Card and Bush\u2019s counsel Alberto Gonzales rushed to visit Ashcroft, who was hospitalized for gallbladder surgery. Faced with Comey\u2019s objections \u2013 and the resistance from Goldsmith \u2013 Ashcroft also balked at continuing the wiretap program, which was temporarily suspended while a compromise was reached on more safeguards. [NYT, Jan. 1, 2006] The battle over the warrantless wiretaps reportedly earned Comey the derisive nickname from Bush as \u201cCuomey\u201d or just \u201cCuomo,\u201d a strong insult from Republicans who deem the former New York governor to be both excessively liberal and famously indecisive. Comey \u2013 previously a well-respected Republican lawyer who was credited with prosecuting key terrorism cases including the Khobar Towers bombing which killed 19 U.S. servicemen in 1996 \u2013 had been deputy attorney general since December 2003. Plame Case But by 2004, Comey already was wearing out his welcome with the White House. He also was responsible for picking Patrick Fitzgerald to be special prosecutor to investigate who leaked the identity of a covert CIA officer after her husband, former Ambassador Joseph Wilson, criticized Bush\u2019s misuse of intelligence on Iraq. In 2003, when Ashcroft was still handling the investigation, Bush had expressed confidence that the leakers would never be identified. But Ashcroft stepped aside because of conflicts of interest and his deputy, Comey, selected U.S. Attorney Fitzgerald. By mid-2004, Fitzgerald was proving himself to be a dogged investigator as he zeroed in on Cheney\u2019s chief of staff Lewis Libby and Bush\u2019s political adviser Karl Rove as two officials suspected of exposing CIA officer Valerie Plame. Demanding testimony from prominent journalists, such as New York Times correspondent Judith Miller, Fitzgerald was too high profile for the White House to easily remove. But the days of Comey \u2013 Fitzgerald\u2019s chief ally \u2013 were numbered. After the \u201ctorture memo\u201d leaked to the Washington Post in June 2004, Comey and Goldsmith threw down the gauntlet again, leading the fight to repudiate the memo and pressing for a revised version that deleted the most controversial elements, again angering the White House, according to Newsweek. Facing withering criticism from White House hardliners, Goldsmith was the first big name to go. In summer 2004, a battered and exhausted Goldsmith quit the Justice Department to become a professor at Harvard Law School. Comey\u2019s Departure A year later, Comey followed Goldsmith out of the department, going into private law practice. On Aug. 15, 2005, in his farewell speech, Comey urged his colleagues to defend the integrity and honesty of the department. \u201cI expect that you will appreciate and protect an amazing gift you have received as an employee of the Department of Justice,\u201d Comey said. \u201cIt is a gift you may not notice until the first time you stand up and identify yourself as an employee of the Department of Justice and say something \u2013 whether in a courtroom, a conference room or a cocktail party \u2013 and find that total strangers believe what you say next. \u201cThat gift \u2013 the gift that makes possible so much of the good we accomplish \u2013 is a reservoir of trust and credibility, a reservoir built for us, and filled for us, by those who went before \u2013 most of whom we never knew. They were people who made sacrifices and kept promises to build that reservoir of trust. \u201cOur obligation \u2013 as the recipients of that great gift \u2013 is to protect that reservoir, to pass it to those who follow, those who may never know us, as full as we got it. The problem with reservoirs is that it takes tremendous time and effort to fill them, but one hole in a dam can drain them. \u201cThe protection of that reservoir requires vigilance, an unerring commitment to truth, and a recognition that the actions of one may affect the priceless gift that benefits all. I have tried my absolute best \u2013 in matters big and small \u2013 to protect that reservoir and inspire others to protect it.\u201d Bush first tried to replace Comey with Timothy Flanigan, a former deputy White House counsel who had become general counsel of Tyco International. But Flanigan\u2019s nomination foundered over questions about his dealings with corrupt Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff and Flanigan\u2019s role in developing White House interrogation policies. \u2018Torture Memo\u2019 In 2002, as deputy to then-White House counsel Gonzales, Flanigan joined other right-wing lawyers in advocating legal strategies for protecting administration officials implicated in abuse of detainees. An Aug. 1, 2002, memo \u2013 prepared by hardliners in the Justice Department and signed by Jay Bybee, then-chief of the Office of Legal Counsel \u2013 defined torture so narrowly that interrogators would have wide latitude in abusing prisoners to extract information. The memo also sought to give Bush authority to order outright torture of detainees. This \u201ctorture memo\u201d argued that U.S. government operatives should be spared prosecution for torture if they had Bush\u2019s approval. Flanigan sat in on at least one meeting during which lawyers discussed various torture techniques, including telling detainees that they would be buried alive and subjecting them to \u201cwaterboarding\u201d which involves tying a person to a board and using water to simulate drowning. Flanigan and Addington reportedly tried to shepherd this policy through the government by limiting the opportunities for critical comments. As Newsweek reported, Flanigan and Addington \u201ccame up with a solution: cut virtually everyone else out.\u201d During questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee on his nomination to replace Comey, Flanigan declined to say whether he voiced support for the \u201ctorture memo\u201d in its original version, although he did say he supported a revised \u2013 less sweeping \u2013 version in December 2004. Flanigan also told the committee that he saw ambiguities in setting limits on the abuse of detainees, saying that he did \u201cnot believe that the term \u2018inhumane\u2019 is susceptible to succinct definition.\u201d As the fight over his nomination grew more contentious, Flanigan asked Bush to withdraw his name on Oct. 6, 2005. [Washington Post, Oct. 8, 2005] With Flanigan\u2019s nomination in flames, the acting deputy to now-Attorney General Gonzales became Paul McNulty, who also has a strong pedigree as a hardline Republican legal operative, a Bush loyalist and a member of Gonzales\u2019s inner circle. McNulty was chief counsel to the Republican-run House Judiciary Committee when it pressed for impeachment of Democratic President Bill Clinton in 1998. McNulty also headed Bush\u2019s Justice Department transition team after Election 2000. [NYT, Oct. 21, 2005] Plame Probe Since Gonzales \u2013 like Ashcroft \u2013 has recused himself on the Plame leak investigation, McNulty also has inherited the job of overseeing Fitzgerald. In that position, the deputy attorney general can apply subtle pressure on the special prosecutor through the allotment of staff and other bureaucratic means. The notion of constraining the work of a special prosecutor by gaining control of his oversight is not unprecedented. After Iran-Contra special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh broke through a long-running White House cover-up of that scandal in 1991, Republican Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist engineered a behind-the-scenes coup against the senior judge overseeing Walsh. In 1992, Rehnquist ousted moderate Republican Judge George MacKinnon as chief of the three-judge panel that picked and oversaw independent counsels. MacKinnon had staunchly backed Walsh, another old-time Republican jurist, as he peeled back the secrets of the complex Iran-Contra schemes, which threatened George H.W. Bush\u2019s reelection. At that key moment, Rehnquist replaced MacKinnon with Judge David Sentelle, one of President Ronald Reagan\u2019s conservative judicial appointees and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Sen. Jesse Helms, then one of the most right-wing Republicans in the U.S. Congress. Earlier, as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, Sentelle had teamed with another Republican judge, Laurence Silberman, to overturn the felony convictions of Oliver North in 1990. Sentelle also provided one of the two votes in 1991 to throw out the convictions of North\u2019s boss, National Security Adviser John Poindexter. Faced with these obstructions, Walsh had come to view the Reagan-Bush loyalists on the U.S. Court of Appeals as \u201ca powerful band of Republican appointees [who] waited like the strategic reserves of an embattled army.\u201d Sentelle, who had named his daughter Reagan after the President, was one of those \u201cstrategic reserves.\u201d A dozen years later, George W. Bush executed a similar maneuver, replacing a relatively non-partisan Republican (Comey) with two candidates who are considered more politically reliable \u2013 or some might say pliable (Flanigan and McNulty). With Comey gone, Fitzgerald still pressed ahead with his investigation of the White House leak of Plame\u2019s identity, but he had lost the strong institutional support that Comey had provided. On Oct. 28, 2005, Fitzgerald indicted Libby for lying to investigators and obstructing justice, but the special prosecutor backed off from his expected indictment of Rove, who had become Bush\u2019s deputy chief of staff. (Significantly, Libby was replaced as Cheney\u2019s chief of staff by David Addington, who had helped formulate the White House policy on torture.) On Feb. 6, 2006 \u2013 with few Americans knowing or understanding the significance of this history \u2013 Gonzales testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, avoiding any details about the internal disputes on the legality of Bush\u2019s warrantless wiretaps. Gonzales simply told the senators that the administration\u2019s reading of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 let Bush bypass its seemingly clear language requiring warrants from a special secret court for wiretaps of communications originating in the United States. Even Republican senators Arlen Specter and Lindsey Graham objected to the administration\u2019s strained interpretation of the law. But Bush, in effect, is buying time while he builds federal judicial majorities in favor of his vision of an all-powerful presidency. Bush took a big step in that direction with the confirmation of Justice Samuel Alito, an architect of the so-called \u201cunitary executive\u201d theory. The U.S. Supreme Court now has at least four of nine justices who favor granting the President virtually unlimited powers as Commander in Chief. In the meantime, Bush is relying on shrewd bureaucratic maneuvers \u2013 neutralizing and removing skeptics \u2013 in order to fend off harassing actions by Democrats and other Americans, including traditional Republican lawyers, who oppose Bush\u2019s extraordinary assertions of power.

The freedom of the hostages, ending a 444-day crisis, brought forth an outpouring of patriotism that bathed the new President in an aura of heroism as a leader so feared by America\u2019s enemies that they scrambled to avoid angering him. It was viewed as a case study of how U.S. toughness could restore the proper international order. That night, as fireworks lit the skies of Washington, the celebration was not only for a new President and for the freed hostages, but for a new era in which American power would no longer be mocked. That momentum continues today in George W. Bush\u2019s \u201cpreemptive\u201d wars and the imperial boasts about a \u201cNew American Century.\u201d However, the reality of that day 25 years ago now appears to have been quite different than was understood at the time, much as George W. Bush\u2019s cowboy rhetoric of smoking Osama bin Laden out and getting him dead or alive has proved more bluster than reality. What\u2019s now known about the Iranian hostage crisis suggests that the \u201ccoincidence\u201d of the Reagan Inauguration and the Hostage Release was not a case of frightened Iranians cowering before a U.S. President who might just nuke Tehran. The preponderance of evidence suggests that it was a prearranged deal between the Republicans and the Iranians. The Republicans got the hostages and the political bounce; Iran\u2019s Islamic fundamentalists got a secret supply of weapons and various other payoffs. State Secret Though the full history remains a state secret \u2013 in part because of an executive order signed by George W. Bush on his first day in office in 2001 \u2013 it appears Republicans did contact Iran\u2019s mullahs during the 1980 campaign; agreements were reached; and a clandestine flow of U.S. weapons followed the hostage release. In effect, while Americans thought they were witnessing one reality \u2013 the cinematic heroism of Ronald Reagan backing down Iran\u2019s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini \u2013 another truth existed beneath the surface, one so troubling that the Reagan-Bush political apparatus has made keeping the secret a top priority. The American people must never think that the Reagan-Bush era began with collusion between Republican operatives and Islamic terrorists, an act close to treason. A part of those secret dealings between Iran and the Republicans surfaced in the Iran-Contra Affair in 1986, when the public learned that the Reagan-Bush administration had sold arms to Iran for its help in freeing U.S. hostages then held in Lebanon. After first denying these facts, the White House acknowledged the existence of the arms deals in 1985 and 1986 but managed to block investigators from looking back before 1984, when the official histories assert that the Iran initiative began. During the 1987 congressional hearings on Iran-Contra, Republicans \u2013 behind the hardnosed leadership of Rep. Dick Cheney \u2013 fought to protect the White House, while Democrats, led by the accommodating Rep. Lee Hamilton, had no stomach for a constitutional crisis. The result was a truncated investigation that laid much of the blame on supposedly rogue operatives, such as Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North. Many American editors quickly grew bored with the complex Iran-Contra case, but a few reporters kept searching for its origins. The trail kept receding in time, back to the Republican-Iranian relationship forged in the heat of the 1980 presidential campaign. \u2018Germs\u2019 of Scandal Besides the few journalists, some U.S. government officials reached the same conclusion. For instance, Nicholas Veliotes, Reagan\u2019s assistant secretary of state for the Middle East, traced the \u201cgerms\u201d of the Iran-Contra scandal to the 1980 campaign. In a PBS interview, Veliotes said he first discovered the secret arms pipeline to Iran when an Israeli weapons flight was shot down over the Soviet Union on July 18, 1981, after straying off course on its third mission to deliver U.S. military supplies from Israel to Iran via Larnaca, Cyprus. \u201cWe received a press report from Tass [the official Soviet news agency] that an Argentinian plane had crashed,\u201d Veliotes said. \u201cAccording to the documents \u2026 this was chartered by Israel and it was carrying American military equipment to Iran. \u2026And it was clear to me after my conversations with people on high that indeed we had agreed that the Israelis could transship to Iran some American-origin military equipment. \u201cNow this was not a covert operation in the classic sense, for which probably you could get a legal justification for it. As it stood, I believe it was the initiative of a few people [who] gave the Israelis the go-ahead. The net result was a violation of American law.\u201d The reason that the Israeli flights violated U.S. law was that no formal notification had been given to Congress about the transshipment of U.S. military equipment as required by the Arms Export Control Act \u2013 a foreshadowing of George W. Bush\u2019s decision two decades later to bypass the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. In checking out the Israeli flight, Veliotes came to believe that the Reagan-Bush camp\u2019s dealings with Iran dated back to before the 1980 election. \u201cIt seems to have started in earnest in the period probably prior to the election of 1980, as the Israelis had identified who would become the new players in the national security area in the Reagan administration,\u201d Veliotes said. \u201cAnd I understand some contacts were made at that time.\u201d Q: \u201cBetween?\u201d Veliotes: \u201cBetween Israelis and these new players.\u201d Israeli Interests In my work on the Iran-Contra scandal, I had obtained a classified summary of testimony from a mid-level State Department official, David Satterfield, who saw the early arms shipments as a continuation of Israeli policy toward Iran. \u201cSatterfield believed that Israel maintained a persistent military relationship with Iran, based on the Israeli assumption that Iran was a non-Arab state which always constituted a potential ally in the Middle East,\u201d the summary read. \u201cThere was evidence that Israel resumed providing arms to Iran in 1980.\u201d Over the years, senior Israeli officials claimed that those early shipments had the discreet blessing of top Reagan-Bush officials. In May 1982, Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon told the Washington Post that U.S. officials had approved the Iranian arms transfers. \u201cWe said that notwithstanding the tyranny of Khomeini, which we all hate, we have to leave a small window open to this country, a tiny small bridge to this country,\u201d Sharon said. A decade later, in 1993, I took part in an interview with former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir in Tel Aviv during which he said he had read Gary Sick\u2019s 1991 book, October Surprise, which made the case for believing that the Republicans had intervened in the 1980 hostage negotiations to disrupt Jimmy Carter\u2019s reelection. With the topic raised, one interviewer asked, \u201cWhat do you think? Was there an October Surprise?\u201d \u201cOf course, it was,\u201d Shamir responded without hesitation. \u201cIt was.\u201d Later in the interview, Shamir seemed to regret his frankness and tried to backpedal on his answer. Lie Detector Iran-Contra special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh also came to suspect that the arms-for-hostage trail led back to 1980, since it was the only way to make sense of why the Reagan-Bush team continued selling arms to Iran in 1985-86 when there was so little progress in reducing the number of American hostages in Lebanon. When Walsh\u2019s investigators conducted a polygraph of George H.W. Bush\u2019s national security adviser Donald Gregg, they added a question about Gregg\u2019s possible participation in the secret 1980 negotiations. \u201cWere you ever involved in a plan to delay the release of the hostages in Iran until after the 1980 Presidential election?\u201d the examiner asked. Gregg\u2019s denial was judged to be deceptive. [See Final Report of the Independent Counsel for Iran/Contra Matters, Vol. I, p. 501] While investigating the so-called October Surprise issue for PBS \u201cFrontline\u201d in 1991-92, I also discovered a former State Department official who claimed contemporaneous knowledge of an October 1980 trip by then vice presidential candidate George H.W. Bush to Paris to meet with Iranians about the hostages. David Henderson, who was then a State Department Foreign Service officer, recalled the date as October 18, 1980. He said he heard about the Paris trip when Chicago Tribune correspondent John Maclean met him for an interview on another topic. Maclean, son of author Norman Maclean who wrote A River Runs Through It, had just been told by a well-placed Republican source that Bush was flying to Paris for a clandestine meeting with a delegation of Iranians about the American hostages. Henderson wasn\u2019t sure whether Maclean was looking for some confirmation or whether he was simply sharing an interesting tidbit of news. For his part, Maclean never wrote about the leak because, he told me later, a GOP campaign spokesman had denied it. Faded Memory As the years passed, the memory of that Bush-to-Paris leak faded for both Henderson and Maclean, until October Surprise allegations bubbled to the surface in the early 1990s. Several intelligence operatives were claiming that Bush had undertaken a secret mission to Paris in mid-October 1980 to give the Iranian government an assurance from one of the two Republicans on the presidential ticket that the GOP promises of future military and other assistance would be kept. Henderson mentioned his recollection of the Bush-to-Paris leak in a 1991 letter to a U.S. senator, which someone sent to me. Though Henderson didn\u2019t remember the name of the Chicago Tribune reporter, we were able to track it back to Maclean through a story that he had written about Henderson. Though not eager to become part of the October Surprise story in 1991, Maclean confirmed that he had received the Republican leak. He also agreed with Henderson\u2019s recollection that their conversation occurred on or about Oct.18, 1980. But Maclean still declined to identify his source. The significance of the Maclean-Henderson conversation was that it was a piece of information locked in a kind of historical amber, untainted by subsequent claims from intelligence operatives whose credibility had been challenged. One couldn\u2019t accuse Maclean of concocting the Bush-to-Paris allegation for some ulterior motive, since he hadn\u2019t used it in 1980, nor had he volunteered it a decade later. He only confirmed it when asked and even then wasn\u2019t eager to talk about it. Bush Meeting The Maclean-Henderson conversation provided important corroboration for the claims by the intelligence operatives, including Israeli intelligence officer Ari Ben-Menashe who said he saw Bush attend a final round of meetings with Iranians in Paris. Ben-Menashe said he was in Paris as part of a six-member Israeli delegation that was coordinating the arms deliveries to Iran. He said the key meeting had occurred at the Ritz Hotel in Paris. In his memoirs, Profits of War, Ben-Menashe said he recognized several Americans, including Republican congressional aide Robert McFarlane and CIA officers Robert Gates, Donald Gregg and George Cave. Then, Ben-Menashe said, Iranian cleric Mehdi Karrubi arrived and walked into a conference room. \u201cA few minutes later George Bush, with the wispy-haired William Casey in front of him, stepped out of the elevator. He smiled, said hello to everyone, and, like Karrubi, hurried into the conference room,\u201d Ben-Menashe wrote. Ben-Menashe said the Paris meetings served to finalize a previously outlined agreement calling for release of the 52 hostages in exchange for $52 million, guarantees of arms sales for Iran, and unfreezing of Iranian monies in U.S. banks. The timing, however, was changed, he said, to coincide with Reagan\u2019s expected Inauguration on Jan. 20, 1981. Ben-Menashe, who repeated his allegations under oath in a congressional deposition, received support from several sources, including pilot Heinrich Rupp, who said he flew Casey \u2013 then Reagan\u2019s campaign director \u2013 from Washington\u2019s National Airport to Paris on a flight that left very late on a rainy night in mid-October. Rupp said that after arriving at LeBourget airport outside Paris, he saw a man resembling Bush on the tarmac. The night of Oct. 18 indeed was rainy in the Washington area. Also, sign-in sheets at the Reagan-Bush headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, placed Casey within a five-minute drive of National Airport late that evening. There were other bits and pieces of corroboration about the Paris meetings. As early as 1987, Iran\u2019s ex-President Bani-Sadr had made similar claims about a Paris meeting between Republicans and Iranians. A French arms dealer, Nicholas Ignatiew, told me in 1990 that he had checked with his government contacts and was told that Republicans did meet with Iranians in Paris in mid-October 1980. A well-connected French investigative reporter Claude Angeli said his sources inside the French secret service confirmed that the service provided \u201ccover\u201d for a meeting between Republicans and Iranians in France on the weekend of Oct. 18-19, 1980. German journalist Martin Kilian had received a similar account from a top aide to the fiercely anti-communist chief of French intelligence, Alexandre deMarenches. Later, deMarenches\u2019s biographer, David Andelman, told congressional investigators under oath that deMarenches admitted that he had helped the Reagan-Bush campaign arrange meetings with Iranians about the hostage issue in the summer and fall of 1980, with one meeting held in Paris in October. Andelman said deMarenches ordered that the secret meetings be kept out of his biography because the story could otherwise damage the reputation of his friends, Casey and Bush. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt my friend, George Bush,\u201d Andelman recalled deMarenches saying as Bush was seeking re-election in 1992. Gates, McFarlane, Gregg and Cave all denied participating in the meeting, though some alibis proved shaky and others were never examined at all. Lashing Out For his part, George H.W. Bush lashed out at the October Surprise allegations. At a news conference on June 4, 1992, Bush was asked if he thought an independent counsel was needed to investigate allegations of secret arms shipments to Iraq during the 1980s. \u201cI wonder whether they\u2019re going to use the same prosecutors that are trying out there to see whether I was in Paris in 1980,\u201d Bush snapped. As a surprised hush fell over the press corps, Bush continued, \u201cI mean, where are we going with the taxpayers\u2019 money in this political year?\u201d Bush then asserted, \u201cI was not in Paris, and we did nothing illegal or wrong here\u201d on Iraq. Though Bush was a former CIA director and had been caught lying about Iran-Contra with his claims of being \u201cout of the loop,\u201d he was still given the benefit of the doubt in 1992. Plus, he had what appeared to be a solid alibi for Oct. 18-19, 1980, Secret Service records which placed him at his home in Washington on that weekend. However, the Bush administration released the records only in redacted form, making it difficult for congressional investigators to verify exactly what Bush had done that day and whom he had met. The records for the key day of Sunday, Oct. 19, purported to show Bush going to the Chevy Chase Country Club in the morning and to someone\u2019s private residence in the afternoon. If Bush indeed had been on those side trips, it would close the window on any possible flight to Paris and back. Investigators of the October Surprise mystery \u2013 including those of us at \u201cFrontline\u201d \u2013 put great weight on the Secret Service records. But little is really known about the Secret Service\u2019s standards for recording the movements of protectees. Since the cooperation of the protectees is essential to the Secret Service staying in position to thwart any attacker, the agents presumably must show flexibility in what details they report. Few politicians are going to want bodyguards around if they write down the details of sensitive meetings or assignations with illicit lovers. Reasonably, the agents might have to fudge or leave out some of the facts. Bush\u2019s Alibi As it turned out, only one Secret Service agent on the Bush detail \u2013 supervisor Leonard Tanis \u2013 claimed a clear recollection of the trip to the Chevy Chase Country Club that Sunday. Tanis told congressional investigators that Mr. and Mrs. Bush went to the Chevy Chase club for brunch with Justice and Mrs. Potter Stewart. But at \u201cFrontline,\u201d we had already gone down that path and found it to be a dead end. We had obtained Mrs. Bush\u2019s protective records and they showed her going to the C&O Canal jogging path in Washington, not to the Chevy Chase club. We also had reached Justice Stewart\u2019s widow, who had no recollection of any Chevy Chase brunch. So it appeared that Tanis was wrong \u2013 and he backed off his claims. The inaccurate Tanis account raised the suspicions of House International Affairs Committee counsel Spencer Oliver. In a six-page memo urging a closer look at the Bush question, Oliver argued that the Secret Service had withheld the uncensored daily report for no justifiable reason from Congress. \u201cWhy did the Secret Service refuse to cooperate on a matter which could have conclusively cleared George Bush of these serious allegations?\u201d Oliver asked. \u201cWas the White House involved in this refusal? Did they order it?\u201d Oliver also noted Bush\u2019s strange behavior in raising the October Surprise issue on his own at two news conferences. \u201cIt can be fairly said that President Bush's recent outbursts about the October Surprise inquiries and [about] his whereabouts in mid-October of 1980 are disingenuous at best,\u201d wrote Oliver, \u201csince the administration has refused to make available the documents and the witnesses that could finally and conclusively clear Mr. Bush.\u201d Secret Flight\n\n\n\nUnintentionally, Bush\u2019s eldest son poked another hole in the assumption that the government would never doctor official records to help cover up international travel by a protected public figure. For Thanksgiving 2003, George W. Bush wanted to make a surprise flight to Iraq. To give Bush\u2019s flight additional security \u2013 and extra drama \u2013 phony flight plans were filed, a false call sign was employed, and Air Force One was identified as a \u201cGulfstream 5\u201d in response to a question from a British Airways pilot. \u201cA senior administration official told reporters that even some members of Bush's Secret Service detail believed he was still in Crawford, Texas, getting ready to have his parents over for Thanksgiving,\u201d Washington Post reporter Mike Allen wrote. [Washington Post, Nov. 28, 2003] Besides falsely telling reporters that George W. Bush planned to spend Thanksgiving at his Texas ranch, Bush\u2019s handlers spirited Bush to Air Force One in an unmarked vehicle, with only a tiny Secret Service contingent, the Post reported. Bush later relished describing the scene to reporters. \u201cThey pulled up in a plain-looking vehicle with tinted windows. I slipped on a baseball cap, pulled 'er down -- as did Condi. We looked like a normal couple,\u201d he said, referring to national security adviser Condoleezza Rice. Though the melodramatic deception surrounding Bush\u2019s flight to Baghdad soon became public \u2013 since it was in essence a publicity stunt \u2013 it did prove the ability of high-ranking officials to conduct their movements in secrecy and the readiness of security personnel to file false reports as part of these operations. Plus, the notion that Secret Service agents wouldn\u2019t doctor an activity report fails to take into account their primary role of protecting leaders who otherwise might choose to go it alone, either for a romantic tryst or a questionable political meeting. As was made clear during the investigation of President Bill Clinton\u2019s sex life, Secret Service agents are loathe to report on what they see because they understand that they wouldn\u2019t be able to do their jobs \u2013 whether protecting U.S. leaders or foreign dignitaries \u2013 if they were seen as potential snitches. By the late 1990s, other elements of the Republicans\u2019 October Surprise alibis were collapsing, including pro-Reagan-Bush claims cited prominently by some news organizations, such as the New Republic and Newsweek. [For more details, see Robert Parry\u2019s Secrecy & Privilege.] With the Republican defenses falling apart and with many documents from the Reagan-Bush years scheduled for release in 2001, the opportunity to finally learn the truth about the pivotal election of 1980 loomed. But George W. Bush elbowed his way into the White House in January 2001 \u2013 and on his first day in office, his counsel Alberto Gonzales drafted an executive order for Bush that postponed release of the Reagan-Bush records. After the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, Bush approved another secrecy order that put the records beyond the public\u2019s reach indefinitely, passing down control of many documents to the President\u2019s descendants. Thus, the truth about how the Reagan-Bush era began in the 1980s \u2013 and what was done to contain the Iran-Contra investigations in the late 1980s and early 1990s \u2013 might eventually become the property of the noted scholars, the Bush twins, Jenna and Barbara. The American people will be kept in the dark about their own history, like the subjects of some hereditary dynasty. Without the facts, they also will be more easily manipulated in the future by emotional appeals devoid of informed debate. The American Imperium \u2013 now a quarter century old \u2013 has taken on the traits of many other authoritarian systems, with only a closed inner circle knowing the dirty truth about how the power was actually gained and how it is wielded.

Bush interrupted regular programming on U.S. networks to deliver an address to the nation that painted the Iraq War and the War on Terror in the same black-and-white colors he has always favored. Despite the media's conventional wisdom about Bush\u2019s new \u201crealism\u201d on Iraq, the old canards were still there \u2013 Saddam Hussein choosing war by rejecting United Nations weapons inspectors; blurred distinctions between Iraqi insurgents and non-Iraqi terrorists; intimations that Bush\u2019s critics are \u201cpartisan\u201d while he embodies the national interest. Plus, there was the same old stark choice between success and failure. \u201cThere are only two options before our country \u2013 victory or defeat,\u201d Bush declared, brushing aside the political and military ambiguities of the Iraq War and the War on Terror. But Bush\u2019s speech and his curious hand gestures as he sat behind a desk in the Oval Office suggested a twitchiness over his apparent realization that the nation increasingly doubts his leadership. Indeed, it appears the American people finally have begun to understand the costs in blood, money and freedoms that have resulted from letting the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks become a justification for transforming the United States into a modern-day empire led by an autocrat who claims the untrammeled right to strike at his perceived enemies abroad and crack down on his opponents at home. Wiretaps A day earlier, an angrier-looking Bush used his weekly radio address to denounce as \u201cirresponsible\u201d senators who resorted to the filibuster to demand more civil-liberties protections in a revised version of the Patriot Act. Bush also lashed out at press disclosures of his three-year-old decision to circumvent the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act by personally approving warrantless electronic eavesdropping on international communications by people inside the United States. \u201cAs a result (of the disclosure), our enemies have learned information they should not have, and the unauthorized disclosure of this effort damages our national security and puts our citizens at risk,\u201d Bush said. \u201cRevealing classified information is illegal.\u201d Bush\u2019s outrage might seem strange to some observers since he has refused to punish his deputy chief of staff Karl Rove for leaking the classified identity of covert CIA officer Valerie Plame after her husband, former Ambassador Joseph Wilson, accused Bush of twisting intelligence to build his case for invading Iraq in 2003. But Bush apparently has judged that he, as president, and his close advisers can decide which laws they wish to obey and when, while simultaneously condemning those outside their circle of power for violating the same laws. This attitude follows Bush\u2019s view that the \u201ccommander in chief\u201d clause of the U.S. Constitution grants him virtually unlimited powers as a \u201cwar president\u201d as long as the War on Terror lasts, a concept of executive authority that recalls the days of absolute authority claimed by Medieval kings and queens. Already, Bush has asserted that his \u201ccommander in chief\u201d powers allow him to arrest citizens and hold them indefinitely without charges; to authorize physical abuse of prisoners; to invade other countries without the necessity of congressional approval; and to ignore international law, including the U.N. Charter and other treaty obligations. As the New York Times reported on Dec. 16 and Bush confirmed on Dec. 17, he also is claiming \u2013 as his constitutional right \u2013 the power to wiretap Americans without court review or the presentation of evidence to any impartial body. When Bush is challenged on these authorities, he asserts that he is following the law, although it is never clear which law or whether anyone other than his appointed lawyers have advised him on the scope of his power. (Conservative legal scholars may have to stretch their notion of the \u201coriginal intent\u201d of the Founders to explain how the writers of the U.S. Constitution in 1787 decided to give a future president the authority to use spy satellites to intercept phone calls and other electronic communications.) It\u2019s also not clear what evidence exists to support Bush\u2019s charge that disclosure of his wiretapping decision damages the national security and endangers U.S. citizens. Under the FISA law dating back to the 1970s, electronic eavesdropping has been permitted inside the United States against foreign agents, including anyone collaborating with an international terrorist group. The law only requires a warrant from a secret court, which rarely rejects an administration request. Presumably, al-Qaeda terrorists inside the United States were aware that their communications were vulnerable to intercepts, explaining why the Sept. 11 attackers were careful to avoid telephonic contacts abroad. But the terrorists would have no way to know whether electronic eavesdropping might be done with or without a warrant, under FISA or Bush\u2019s order. Yet, Bush\u2019s complaint that disclosure of his personal wiretapping authority endangers national security presupposes the terrorists knew that their phone calls would somehow be immune from a FISA court warrant but susceptible to Bush\u2019s wiretap order. Since that assumption makes no sense, one can only conclude that Bush threw in the accusation about endangering national security to impugn the patriotism of his critics and rev up his base, much as he did during the run-up to invading Iraq when skeptics were shouted down as traitors and liars. [See, for instance, Consortiumnews.com\u2019s \u201cPolitics of Preemption.\u201d] Questionable Targets Bush\u2019s assertion of his unilateral authority to wiretap anyone he wishes also raises questions about whether some of his eavesdropping is aimed at political opponents or journalists, rather than terrorists. While Bush claims his wiretaps were vital to the national security, they came at a time when the FISA court was approving record numbers of warrants for secret surveillance. According to FISA\u2019s annual report for 2004, there were a record 1,758 applications for spying authorization that year and none was denied by the special court. The administration\u2019s explanation for why additional secret wiretaps were needed is that Bush\u2019s order saves time when a quick wiretap is required, such as when a foreign terrorist is captured and his phone records are seized. But the FISA court can clear warrants in a few hours \u2013 or Bush could exercise emergency powers under the law to conduct wiretaps for 72 hours before obtaining approval from the court. That emergency provision was inserted in the law to give presidents leeway when the threat was a surprise nuclear attack by the Soviet Union with the potential of wiping out nearly the entire U.S. population. Even during the Cold War, the FISA provisions were acceptable to Presidents Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. But now, with a much less severe threat from al-Qaeda terrorists, George W. Bush has decided that the law must be waived at his discretion, bypassing the court on hundreds and possibly thousands of surveillance orders. That suggests other motives may exist for some of these wiretaps, such as the possibility that some intercepted conversations would be rejected by even the rubber-stamping FISA court, like requests to spy on activists, politicians or journalists. The Bush administration, for instance, has accused the Arab news network al-Jazeera of collaborating with al-Qaeda and U.S. news executives are known to communicate with al-Jazeera over access to its exclusive video. Would these phone calls and e-mails be covered by Bush\u2019s extraordinary wiretap authority? Bush\u2019s right-wing allies also have labeled some American journalists, such as Seymour Hersh, traitors for writing articles about the War on Terror that reveal secret operations that Bush has wanted to keep hidden. Plus, there may be U.S. politicians or activists communicating with Islamic leaders overseas. While the full range of Bush\u2019s intercepts is not known, the administration\u2019s use of National Security Agency intercepts was an issue earlier this year, when it was disclosed that John Bolton, Bush\u2019s nominee to be United Nations ambassador, had requested names of Americans that had been excised from NSA transcripts for privacy reasons. Senate Democrats demanded that documents be turned over on 10 cases in which Bolton used his position as under secretary of state for arms control to obtain the names. The White House refused to provide the information and Bush evaded the need for Senate confirmation of Bolton\u2019s ambassadorship by making him a \u201crecess appointment.\u201d Hand Gestures As for Sunday\u2019s prime-time Iraq War speech, Bush broke with the reassuring tradition of a president sitting behind the Oval Office desk with hands folded. Instead, Bush took to waving his arms as he delivered the speech. \u201cGrim-faced, yet with a trace of anxiety in his eyes, Bush delivered the remarks seated rigidly at a desk, making a variety of hand gestures,\u201d observed Washington Post TV critic Tom Shales. [Washington Post, Dec. 19, 2005] Some of Bush\u2019s strange body language may be explained by the fact that even he must realize that his assertions include a number of falsehoods, such as his routine deception that Saddam Hussein defied U.N. demands on destroying his weapons of mass destruction and on letting in U.N. weapons inspectors. \u201cIt is true that [Hussein] systematically concealed those [WMD] programs, and blocked the work of U.N. weapons inspectors,\u201d Bush told the nation. \u201cHe was given an ultimatum \u2013 and he made his choice for war.\u201d But it is not true that Hussein blocked the work of U.N. weapons inspectors. In fact, he acquiesced to a U.N. ultimatum and let them back into Iraq in November 2002. Chief inspector Hans Blix said his team was finally given free rein to examine suspected WMD sites, but Bush forced the inspectors to leave so the invasion could proceed. As it turned out, Hussein was telling the truth when he said there were no WMD caches left. After the invasion, Bush\u2019s own team of inspectors concluded that Iraq\u2019s WMD stockpiles had been destroyed by earlier U.N. inspections and by U.S. bombing during the Clinton administration. Yet, beginning a few months after the U.S. invasion \u2013 as it became clear there was no WMD and as U.S. casualties mounted \u2013 Bush began rewriting history, claiming that Hussein had not let the U.N. inspectors in, thus forcing Bush to invade. This lie presumably made Bush appear more reasonable. On July 14, 2003, Bush said about Hussein, \u201cwe gave him a chance to allow the inspectors in, and he wouldn\u2019t let them in. And, therefore, after a reasonable request, we decided to remove him from power.\u201d In the following months, Bush repeated this claim in slightly varied forms. On Jan. 27, 2004, Bush said, \u201cWe went to the United Nations, of course, and got an overwhelming resolution \u2013 1441 \u2013 unanimous resolution, that said to Saddam, you must disclose and destroy your weapons programs, which obviously meant the world felt he had such programs. He chose defiance. It was his choice to make, and he did not let us in.\u201d Eventually, this false history became part of Bush\u2019s regular litany about the war. Despite the fact that it was an obvious lie \u2013 the U.S. news media had witnessed the work of the U.N. inspectors inside Iraq \u2013 Bush was rarely challenged about his historical revisionism. [For details, see Consortiumnews.com \u201cPresident Bush, With the Candlestick\u2026\u201d] Terrorists or Insurgents Similarly, Bush continues to blur the distinctions between the Sunni-led Iraqi insurgency that has often used roadside bombs to attack American troops and the relatively small number of non-Iraqi terrorists who have exploded bombs aimed at civilian targets. Bush has employed the rhetorical device of using insurgent and terrorist synonymously, much as he and Vice President Dick Cheney used juxtaposition to convince millions of Americans that the Iraqi government was somehow responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks. In his Dec. 18 speech, for instance, Bush said, \u201cthe terrorists will continue to have the coward\u2019s power to plant roadside bombs and recruit suicide bombers,\u201d making no distinction between the tactics of the insurgents and the terrorists. The danger from this sleight of hand is that it blocks consideration of possible resolution of the Iraq War. Many military analysts believe the only realistic route toward a reasonably successful policy in Iraq is to address the political and economic concerns of Iraq\u2019s Sunni minority \u2013 who want a U.S. withdrawal, more political clout and a share of the nation\u2019s oil revenues \u2013 while isolating the relatively small number of foreign jihadists. Though Bush has made some concessions to this reality in recent speeches, he chose to return to his broad-brush rhetoric in the national address. Again, it was a case of good versus evil, victory or surrender, his way or the highway. \u201cDefeatism may have its partisan uses,\u201d Bush said of his critics, \u201cbut it is not justified by the facts.\u201d Bush also resorted to a favorite tactic of ascribing ridiculous notions to his critics. \u201cIf you think the terrorists would become peaceful if only America would stop provoking them, then it might make sense to leave them alone,\u201d Bush said. The president then returned to his long-time claim that Islamic extremists are motivated by their hatred of America\u2019s freedom. \u201cThe terrorists do not merely object to American actions in Iraq and elsewhere, they object to our deepest values and our way of life,\u201d Bush said. \u201cAnd if we were not fighting them in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in Southeast Asia, and in other places, the terrorists would not be peaceful citizens, they would be on the offense, and headed our way.\u201d Again, Bush was reprising rhetoric that exaggerates or misstates the enemy\u2019s goals and capabilities as a way to box in the U.S. political debate and shut the door on reasonable alternative strategies. Bush continues to discuss al-Qaeda as if it is a powerful international force on par with Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia, when many analysts see it as a fringe organization that was driven out of most Islamic countries, almost to the ends of the earth \u2013 or in this case to the mountains of Afghanistan. Without doubt, al-Qaeda-inspired terrorists exploited a letdown in U.S. security in 2001 to conduct an extraordinary attack on New York and Washington, but a realistic assessment of its actual clout is important in calibrating a response. If al-Qaeda is actually a marginal organization that can be isolated even more by the West adopting a respectful approach to the Muslim world, then Bush\u2019s approach of invading Arab countries \u2013 and curtailing American liberties \u2013 makes no sense, unless Bush\u2019s real motives are something else: say, controlling Middle East resources and transforming the United States into a modern one-party state with him or his allies in permanent control. The analysis that follows from Bush\u2019s assertion of unlimited presidential powers and his deceptive explanations to the American people about Iraq suggests two alternative theories. Either Bush is increasingly unstable, incapable of discerning reality from his own propaganda, or he is concealing his real agenda with misleading arguments. Put differently, either the United States is experiencing a kind of modern \u201cmadness of King George\u201d \u2013 like what happened when King George III became unstable in the years after losing the Colonies \u2013 or the American people are living under a cunning Machiavelli with a calculated method to his apparent madness. Either way, the prospects are troubling for American democracy \u2013 and it may not be clear which of the alternative scenarios is more worrisome.

Under the name \u201cAnonymous,\u201d he wrote Imperial Hubris, a critical look at U.S. counter-terrorist strategies. He was interviewed recently about the War on Terror by journalist Richard Fricker. A version of this interview first appeared in the Swiss publication, SonntagsBlick. Regarding so-called \u201crendition\u201d flights to other countries and secret CIA prisons: Scheuer: \u201cFrom the start, the [CIA\u2019s] clandestine service would much prefer to bring these people to the United States. One of the Cold War hangovers in America is we are still looking for people to do our dirty work. We were so used to, during the Cold War, of using proxies that we\u2019re still doing that. Look how much we depend on the Pakistanis to capture Osama bin Laden. There is a certain process of returning to adulthood that has not taken place in the U.S. leadership.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a huge misperception that we are kind of invulnerable and we can have other people do our bidding. In terms of the Islamic militants, on both sides of the aisle in America, there is a huge self-delusion that these people are gangsters and deviants and criminals and that they are such a small part of Muslim society and that we can arrest them one man at a time. \u201cSo we\u2019re still playing this game of super cops and robbers and we\u2019re really not serious about protecting America or destroying al-Qaeda and its allies because we still treat it as a super law enforcement problem. \u2026 \u201cI resigned from the CIA in part to try and make them aware that al-Qaeda and bin Laden are heroes in the Islamic world, to a huge percentage. Not because they believe in what al-Qaeda does but in the sense of standing up to the United States. \u2026 \u201cAl-Qaeda is a liberation movement in many ways in the sense that their main target is not the United States, but to get us out of the way and then to overthrow the Israelis and \u2026 Egypt and Saudi Arabia, the tyrannies as they see them.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe bottom line for me is we don\u2019t have to empathize or sympathize with\n\nthese people, but if we don\u2019t understand the numbers that are involved and\n\nthe motivations they feel because of our policies, we\u2019re never going to be\n\nable to protect ourselves.\u201d Regarding poor intelligence about Iraq and weapons of mass destruction: Scheuer: \u201cThe intelligence community, as well the people who worked on counter-terrorism, clearly told the administration that an invasion of Iraq would break the back of a fight against bin Laden because it would validate virtually everything he had said about the United States over the years. This administration came into office with a contempt for the intelligence community.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not one American politician willing to say \u2018they don\u2019t hate us for what do, or how we live. They may not like it, but they\u2019re not going to blow themselves up over it. But they will blow themselves up over what we do in the Islamic world.\u2019 And, that has been the problem under Mr. Clinton and Mr. Bush.\u201d Regarding the Islamic world\u2019s historical reference point of the Crusades: Scheuer: \u201cThe historical awareness of Muslims is extraordinary, in the sense that 65 percent of the Islamic world is illiterate, but all of them know their history, from having the Koran read to them, from having the Prophet\u2019s biography read to them. When bin Laden makes an illusion to something that happened in the Seventh Century, people get it within a few words. So yes, the resonance of the Crusades is very strong.\u201d\n\n\n\nRegarding Israel\u2019s stake in U.S. policy: Scheuer: \u201cWe are at the point where we can no longer tolerate that Israel dictates the policy the U.S. must follow. It\u2019s time we play the great power in the relationship and not the minor power. Fifty years is enough, I think Israel should do whatever it needs to do to defend itself. I have no qualms about that, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth one dead American.\u201d\n\n\n\nRegarding the impact of the Iraq War on the al-Qaeda problem: Scheuer: \u201cI think the debacle in Iraq is the real horrific thing that\u2019s coming down the road. Al-Qaeda is now al-Qaedaism and has really taken hold in other parts of the world. The media, especially American media, is really bore-sighted on Iraq. But if you look at Thailand and the Philippines, the Northern Caucuses, northern Nigeria, militant Islam is really gaining traction. These will be problem areas in the not too distant future. \u201cI also think that the rather sophomoric argument about setting a deadline for the U.S. to pull out of Iraq only makes the enemy strong. I don\u2019t think either party is serious about this. There will be a pull out just in time for the 2006 elections. \u2026 \u201cThe real tragic thing about Iraq is that the administration didn\u2019t put much thought into what they were doing, especially about the Sunnis. They thought they would box them into a place where the Sunnis would attack and we could kill them. \u201cIn the thinking of the Islamic militant, Iraq is contiguous territory to countries they were never able to get to before. They are always looking for a Pakistan, it was their safe haven against the Russians. Bin Laden has explained that the reason he has not sent fighters to the Balkans or Israel is because there was not a safe-haven border from which they could operate. Iraq now gives them safe haven to attack Syria, Israel, Jordan and Turkey. \u2026 \u201cThe militants aren\u2019t going to be bought off with economic improvements. One of the great mistakes that Americans make is to believe that these people are motivated by poverty, or the lack of education or that they don\u2019t have prospects for a career. Al-Qaeda and its allies are mostly middle- and upper-class educated people. They appeal to educated people, or they wouldn\u2019t spend so much time dominating the Internet. \u201cThere seems to be this belief that if we build schools it will make militant\n\nMuslims un-militant. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. \u2026 They\u2019re very rational actors.\u201d Regarding what\u2019s happened to militants captured as early as 1995: Scheuer: \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody has been released. \u2026 People we picked up are being held someplace else. I don\u2019t think we held anyone until after 9/11. But the rendition program initially delivered people to countries where they were wanted. [These people are either still incarcerated] or they\u2019re dead. We never picked up anyone who wasn\u2019t wanted by the authorities. \u201cThe rendition program was designed to do two things: to take people off the streets that we knew were a threat to the United States, and two, at the time of their arrest, to pick up any hard-copy documents they had. No one was ever picked up so they could be talked to. Any intelligence service will tell you that al-Qaeda guys are trained to fight from the jail cell by giving false information mixed with some good information that\u2019s dated. \u2026 \u201cWe still behave as if this were still the terrorism of the Eighties. The terrorism of that era was a lethal nuisance, but it was never a national security threat. The problem, for the U.S. at least is that the possibility of a large attack is a reality and the possibility of another attack is on the horizon. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen in the United States is that there\u2019s going to be a much larger attack than 9/11 or there will be a kind of nuclear attack with a weapon acquired from the former Soviet Union. The surest sign that neither party in the country takes the possibility of an attack seriously is that we have done nothing to help Russia secure its nuclear weapons. \u201cI think Iraq is going to be central to the threat for the next decade or more. And, I think we have probably signed the death warrant for Jordan. I think the two attacks we have seen there are just the start of what\u2019s going to happen. Bin Laden has always said the great human reserve for Islam is Asia, so I assume we will see things continue to evolve in that region. \u2026 \u201cPart of the reason we haven\u2019t seen al-Qaeda is because bin Laden had to satisfy an enormous amount of critics within the Islamic militant movement before he attacks us again. He was criticized first for not having warned us enough. Secondly, for not offering us a chance to convert. Both of those things sound silly, but they are very clear demands made by the prophet before Muslims attack. \u201cThe third criticism was that bin Laden did not have enough religious justification to kill that many Americans. He had to close those three loops. From about the spring of 2002 prior to the election, he gave four speeches directly to the American people saying that \u2018because your governments policy depends on the support of the public, I can only assume that if you keep voting for the people that maintain these policies that you approve of them.\u2019 The last one was on the eve of the election. \u2026 \u201cThe third thing he did was to secure from a Saudi sheik was religious authorization to use nuclear weapons against the United States, that was in May 2003. \u2026 Al Zarqawi has said, \u2018thank God for letting the Americans invade Iraq because now they will be defeated if they stay and defeated if they leave.\u2019 \u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s so much more than Israel. We are so dependent, along with our European allies on oil out of the Gulf, we still are going to be supporting the al-Saud tyranny. We\u2019re going to support the Egyptian tyranny because of the peace process. We\u2019re still going to be in Afghanistan. \u2026 \u201cThe real danger for America is they will turn to the idea of a Marshall Plan or New Deal and that by pumping tons of money into the Middle East to build schools that that will somehow cure militancy. [What will cure the problem is] disengagement. What this is about is the future of Islamic civilization. We are bearing the brunt right now because we are in the way.\u201d\n\n\n\nRegarding claims that Islamic militants seek world domination: Scheuer: \u201cThat\u2019s the rather silly argument of the neoconservatives. The idea that we\u2019re facing a united Islamic juggernaut is just nonsense. The only thing that creates unity within Islam right now is hatred of U.S. policy. As we become less of a focus, the energies of the Islamist will begin to focus on Israel and Saudi Arabia and the other Arab states. \u2026 \u201cIt is absolutely in their [neoconservatives\u2019] interest to make us believe the militants hate us because we are democratic and have liberty. The idea that someone blows himself up to try to destroy Mubarak and you call him a \u2018freedom-hater,\u2019 there\u2019s a disconnect there. Mubarak is a police state, the Saudis are a police state. The Islamists may not have the same definition of freedom that we have, freedom is different in every culture, but there is every bit of evidence that the Muslim militant movement is as much a liberation movement as it is anything else.\u201d\n\n\n\nRegarding the possible effect of a Democratic victory in 2006 congressional elections: Scheuer: \u201cIt could make it worse. Mr. and Mrs. Clinton are seen as friends of Israel, ... and if the Democrats come in, they are viewed by the militants as more pro-Israel than the Republicans.\u201d Regarding differences in \u201crenditions\u201d under Bill Clinton and George W. Bush: Scheuer: \u201cIn a sense, I would say these prisoners are better treated in the hands of Americans than they were when the Clinton administration wanted us to take these people to places like Egypt. It\u2019s kind of a disconnect for me. The Clinton administration wanted no part of treating these people in a manly fashion and keeping them as prisoners of war. \u2026 \u201cThe difference between the two administrations is that now we are holding people. Under the Clinton administration they didn\u2019t want any part of it. They wanted us to give them to the Egyptians or other Middle Eastern countries. \u2026I think the big difference in the Bush administration is that we hold people at Guantanamo and in Iraq. \u2026 \u201cThe Clinton guys didn\u2019t want to hold these people. So we said, \u2018OK, we\u2019ll focus on guys that have outstanding warrants and try to get them returned to their country of origin.\u2019 We said, \u2018You know, Mr. President, Mr. Sandy Berger, Mr. Richard Clarke, that if they go to any Middle Eastern country, they\u2019re not going to be treated the way they would be in the United States. We said the State Department puts out a negative human rights report on virtually every state where we would send these guys. What do you want us to do?\u2019 \u201dThey asked, \u2018Will the countries that agree to accept these people agree to treat them according to their own laws?\u2019 We said, \u201cSure, we bet they will do that.\u2019 And, that\u2019s what satisfied them. Mr. Clinton and Mr. (Richard) Clarke have been trying to re-write history by saying we insisted that these countries treat these people by the standard of international law and the law in America and that was never the case. \u2026 \u201cThe rendition program has been enormously successful and well conducted except for the last step, where these people were to be held. In that sense, I think the United States has shot itself in the foot. If we had treated people who declared war on us as prisoners of war and brought them to America and treated them as we did prisoners in World War II, the world might not like it, but we wouldn\u2018t have all the trouble we have at the moment.\u201d Back to Home Page", "domain": "www.consortiumnews.com", "label": 1, "url": "http://www.consortiumnews.com/2005/121205a.html"}

But this pro-Rove argument is a curious one, since the facts about the 2004 conversation would seem to buttress the case against Rove, not exonerate him. The available evidence now suggests that Rove did lie to a federal grand jury \u2013 even after his lawyer got the warning in early 2004 \u2013 and that Rove only admitted the initial contact with the Time reporter when documentary evidence surfaced nine months later. What is most striking about the early 2004 conversation is that it appears that even after Time reporter Viveca Novak alerted Rove\u2019s lawyer Robert Luskin that Rove had passed on information about CIA officer Valerie Plame to Time reporter Matthew Cooper, Rove still claimed to have no recollection when he testified before a federal grand jury in February 2004. Only in October 2004, when Luskin discovered an e-mail from Rove to deputy national security adviser Stephen Hadley, recounting the Rove-Cooper conversation in June 2003, did Rove change his grand jury testimony to admit that he had told Cooper about Plame\u2019s identity, according to a Washington Post chronology. Citing a \u201cperson familiar with the case,\u201d the Post reported that Viveca \u201cNovak told Luskin about the Rove-Cooper connection before Rove\u2019s first appearance before the grand jury in February 2004. In that appearance, Rove testified that he did not recall talking to Cooper about Plame. It was not until October 2004 that Rove told the grand jury that he recalled the Cooper chat.\u201d [Washington Post, Dec. 3, 2005] Stonewall It\u2019s still unclear why Rove would have thought he could stonewall the grand jury about the Cooper conversation in February 2004 if Rove\u2019s lawyer Luskin already knew about it from Novak. Rove might have expected that Time magazine would successfully resist the demands from special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald for Cooper\u2019s testimony. According to that scenario, Rove would have finally told the grand jury on Oct. 15, 2004, about the Cooper conversation only after the documentary evidence was unequivocal and it was clear Fitzgerald was serious about forcing journalists to testify. In the days before Rove\u2019s reversal, Fitzgerald subpoenaed Cooper, and Chief U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan issued a contempt citation demanding Cooper\u2019s appearance before the grand jury. So, one interpretation of the timeline is that Rove did recall his June 2003 chat with Cooper \u2013 and was reminded again by the Novak-Luskin conversation \u2013 but still denied the facts in his first grand jury appearance because he assumed that Fitzgerald would back off when journalists refused to testify. That has often been the case in the past. [See, for instance, Consortiumnews.com\u2019s \u201cDissing Fitzgerald & Prosecutorial Politics.\u201d] Upon realizing that Fitzgerald was determined to secure Cooper\u2019s testimony and was getting support from the federal bench, Rove may have judged that he had little choice but to rush back to the grand jury to correct his testimony, hoping that his claim of a faulty memory might still be plausible. So, the new revelation that Rove\u2019s attorney had been alerted to the Rove-Cooper conversation in early 2004 \u2013 and presumably discussed that information with his client \u2013 would seem to bolster the case against Rove. Nevertheless, Rove\u2019s backers are citing the Novak-Luskin contact as somehow exculpatory for Rove. In October 2005, Luskin reportedly mentioned the Novak conversation to Fitzgerald to dissuade him from indicting Rove as the first grand jury was completing its term. Rove\u2019s defenders then were encouraged when Fitzgerald only indicted vice presidential chief of staff Lewis Libby on charges of perjury, lying to the FBI and obstruction of justice. Some pro-Rove commentators pointed to Fitzgerald\u2019s failure to indict Rove as evidence that George W. Bush\u2019s chief political adviser had escaped legal jeopardy. But Fitzgerald has since impaneled a new grand jury and is expected to call Viveca Novak to testify in the coming days. Bad News An indictment of Rove would be very bad news for President Bush, who would then see the Plame case inching ever closer to the Oval Office. Already, the emerging evidence has linked Vice President Dick Cheney to the leak case. The New York Times reported that more than a month before Plame was outed in a July 14, 2003, column by conservative writer Robert Novak, the vice president was told about Plame\u2019s identity by then-CIA Director George Tenet. At the time, Cheney was angry that Plame\u2019s husband, former Ambassador Joseph Wilson, was challenging a chief rationale for the invasion of Iraq. Wilson was telling reporters that he had been sent by the CIA to check out reports of Iraq trying to buy enriched uranium from Niger and had concluded that the claims were false. But the White House still used the Niger allegations in making its terrifying case that Iraq\u2019s Saddam Hussein was on course to build a nuclear bomb. After Wilson began to blow the whistle in the months after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in March 2003, Tenet divulged to Cheney that Wilson\u2019s wife worked for the CIA and had a hand in arranging Wilson\u2019s fact-finding trip to Niger \u2013 information that Cheney then passed on to Libby in a conversation on June 12, 2003, according to Libby\u2019s notes as described by lawyers in the case, the New York Times reported. [NYT, Oct. 25, 2005] Those two facts \u2013 Plame\u2019s work for the CIA and her role in Wilson\u2019s Niger trip \u2013 then became the centerpieces of the administration\u2019s behind-the-scenes campaign in June/July 2003 to disparage Wilson. Rove, Libby and other administration officials told journalists that Wilson\u2019s wife had helped get him the Niger assignment. On July 14, 2003, Robert Novak\u2019s column, citing two administration sources, outed Plame and portrayed Wilson\u2019s Niger trip as a case of nepotism. (Robert Novak and Viveca Novak are not related.) Furious that Plame\u2019s covert identity had been blown, CIA officers pressed Tenet to refer the case to the Justice Department to determine whether the disclosure violated a law barring the willful exposure of a CIA officer. An investigation was soon launched. Responding to the initial inquiries, Libby and Rove reportedly suggested they may have heard about Plame\u2019s CIA job from reporters and just recycled the rumors. But Fitzgerald\u2019s investigation discovered that the White House officials had clued reporters in on Plame\u2019s identity, not vice versa. Fitzgerald has so far obtained a five-count indictment against Libby. Now, Viveca Novak\u2019s testimony could help determine whether the prosecutor is convinced that the case against Rove is ripe for grand jury charges, too.

This is what the New Great Game in Eurasia is all about.\n\nIn a nutshell, a few years ago Russia devised North Stream \u2013 fully operational \u2013 and South Stream \u2013 still a project \u2013 to bypass unreliable Ukraine as a gas transit nation. Now Russia devises a new sweet deal with Turkey to bypass the \u201cnon-constructive\u201d (Putin\u2019s words) approach of the European Commission (EC) concerning the European \u201cThird Energy Package\u201d, which prohibits one company from controlling the full cycle of extraction, transportation and sale of energy resources.\n\nBackground is essential to understand the current game. Already five years ago I was following in detail Pipelineistan\u2019s ultimate opera \u2013 the war between rival pipelines South Stream and Nabucco. Nabucco eventually became road kill. South Stream may eventually be resurrected, but only if the EC comes to its senses (don\u2019t bet on it.)\n\nThe 3,600 kilometer South Stream should be in place by 2016, branching out to Austria and the Balkans/Italy. Gazprom owns it with a 50% stake \u2013 along with Italy\u2019s ENI (20%), French EDF (15%) and German Wintershall, a subsidiary of BASF (15%). As it stands, these European energy majors are not exactly beaming \u2013 to say the least. For months, Gazprom and the EC were haggling about a solution, but in the end Brussels predictably succumbed to its own mediocrity \u2013 and relentless US pressure over weak-link and European Union member Bulgaria.\n\nRussia still gets to build a pipeline under the Black Sea, but one now redirected to Turkey and, crucially, pumping the same amount of gas South Stream would. Not to mention Russia gets to build a new LNG (liquefied natural gas) central hub in the Mediterranean. Thus Gazprom has not spent US$5 billion in vain (finance, engineering costs). The redirection makes total business sense. Turkey is Gazprom\u2019s second-biggest customer after Germany; much bigger than Bulgaria, Hungary and Austria combined.\n\nRussia also advances a unified gas distribution network capable of delivering natural gas from anywhere in Russia to any hub alongside Russia\u2019s borders.\n\nAnd as if it was needed, Russia gets yet another graphic proof that its real growth market in the future is Asia, especially China \u2013 not a fearful, stagnated, austerity-devastated, politically paralyzed EU. The evolving Russia-China strategic partnership implies Russia as complementary to China, excelling in major infrastructure projects from building of dams to laying out pipelines. This is trans-Eurasia business with a sharp geopolitical reach and not subjected to ideology-drenched politics.\n\nRussian \u201cdefeat\u201d? Really?\n\nTurkey also made a killing. It\u2019s not only the deal with Gazprom; Moscow will build no less than Turkey\u2019s entire nuclear industry, and there will be increased soft power interaction (more trade and tourism). Most of all, Turkey is now increasingly on the verge of becoming a full member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO); Moscow is actively lobbying for it.\n\nThis means Turkey acceding to a privileged position as a major hub simultaneously in the Eurasian Economic Belt and of course the Chinese New Silk Road(s). The EU blocks Turkey? Turkey looks East. That\u2019s Eurasian integration on the move.\n\nWashington has tried very hard to create a New Berlin Wall from the Baltics to the Black Sea to \u201cisolate\u201d Russia. And yet Team \u201cDon\u2019t Do Stupid Stuff\u201d in Washington never saw it coming \u2013 yet another Putin judo/chess/go counterpunch applied exactly across the Black Sea.\n\nAsia Times Online has been reporting for years how Turkey\u2019s key strategic imperative is to configure itself as the indispensable energy crossroads from East to West \u2013 transiting everything from Iraqi oil to Caspian Sea gas. Oil from Azerbaijan already transits Turkey via the Bill Clinton/Zbig Brzezinski-propelled BTC (Baku-Tblisi-Ceyhan) pipeline. Turkey would also be the crossroads if a Trans-Caspian pipeline is ever built (slim chances as it stands), pumping natural gas from Turkmenistan to Azerbaijan, then transported to Turkey and finally Europe.\n\nSo what Putin\u2019s judo/chess/go counterpunch accomplished with a single move is to have stupid EU sanctions once again hurt the EU. The German economy is already hurting badly because of lost Russia business.\n\nThe EC brilliant \u201cstrategy\u201d revolves around the EU\u2019s Third Energy Package, which requires that pipelines and the natural gas flowing inside them must be owned by separate companies. The target of this package has always been Gazprom \u2013 which owns pipelines in many Central and Eastern European nations. The target within the target has always been South Stream.\n\nNow it\u2019s up to Bulgaria and Hungary, which have always fought the EC \u201cstrategy\u201d, to explain the fiasco to their own populations, and to keep pressing Brussels; after all they are bound to lose a fortune, not to mention get no gas, with South Stream out of the picture. Bulgaria alone reportedly has lost more than 6,000 new jobs and over $3 billion of investment due to the loss of South Stream.\n\nSo here\u2019s the bottom line; Russia sells even more gas \u2013 to Turkey; Turkey gets much-needed gas with a cool discount; and the EU, pressured by the Empire of Chaos, is reduced to dance, dance, dance like a bunch of headless chickens in dark Brussels corridors wondering what hit them. And while the Atlanticists are back to default mode \u2013 cooking up yet more sanctions \u2013 Russia is set to keep buying more and more gold.\n\nWatch those spears\n\nThis is not the endgame \u2013 far from it. In the near future, many variables will intersect.\n\nAnkara\u2019s game may change \u2013 but that\u2019s far from a given. President Recep Erdogan \u2013 the Sultan of Constantinople \u2013 has certainly identified a rival, Caliph Ibrahim of ISIS/ISIL/Daesh fame, trying to steal his mojo. Thus the sultan may flirt with mollifying his neo-Ottoman dreams and contemplate steering Turkey back to its previously ditched \u201czero problems with our neighbors\u201d foreign policy doctrine.\n\nNot so fast. Erdogan\u2019s game so far was the same as that of the House of Saud and Qatar\u2019s House of Thani; get rid of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to allow an oil pipeline from Saudi Arabia and a gas pipeline from the South Pars/North Dome mega-field in Qatar. This pipeline would be Qatar-Iraq-Syria-Turkey, rivaling the already proposed, $10 billion Iran-Iraq-Syria pipeline. Final customers: the EU, of course, desperate in its \u201cescape from Gazprom\u201d offensive.\n\nSo what now? Will Erdogan abandon his \u201cAssad must go\u201d obsession? It\u2019s too early to tell. The Turkish Foreign Ministry is spinning to the media that Washington and Ankara are about to agree on a no-fly zone along the Turkish-Syria border \u2013 even as the White House, earlier this week, insisted the idea had been scrapped.\n\nThe House of Saud is like a camel lost in the Arctic. The House of Saud\u2019s lethal game in Syria always boiled down to regime change so that the Saudi-sponsored oil pipeline from Syria to Turkey might be built. Now the Saudis see Russia about to supply all of Turkey\u2019s energy needs \u2013 and still be positioned to sell more gas to the EU in the near future. And Assad still won\u2019t go.\n\nBut it is US neo-cons who are sharpening their poisonous spears with gusto. As soon as early 2015 there may be a Ukrainian Freedom Act in the US House of Representatives. Translation: Ukraine being dubbed a \u201cmajor US non-NATO ally\u201d, which means, in practice, a virtual NATO annexation. Next step: more turbo-charged neo-con provocation of Russia.\n\nA possible scenario is vassal/puppies such as Romania or Bulgaria, pressed by Washington, deciding to allow full access of NATO vessels into the Black Sea. Who cares that this would violate current Black Sea agreements that affect both Russia and Turkey?\n\nAnd then there\u2019s a dangerous Rumsfeldian \u201cknown unknown\u201d: how the fragile Balkans will feel subordinated to the whims of Ankara. As much as Brussels keeps Greece, Bulgaria and Serbia in a strait jacket, in energy terms they will start depending on Turkey\u2019s goodwill.\n\nFor the moment, let\u2019s appreciate the magnitude of the geopolitical shockwaves after Putin\u2019s latest judo/chess/go combo. And get ready for another chapter of Russia\u2019s \u201cpivoting across Eurasia\u201d. Putin hits Delhi on Thursday. Expect another geopolitical bombshell.\n\nPepe Escobar\u2019s new book, just out, is Empire of Chaos. Follow him on Facebook.

Watch the original presentation in the video below:\n\nNow I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cWhy we must oppose the Bilderberg Group? Really? Do we need an essay on this?\u201d If you\u2019re reading this, you\u2019re probably one of the ones who don\u2019t even have to be told what the Bilderberg group is, much less why it must be opposed. And if you do consider yourself in that group, then I salute you. You are clearly one of the more tuned-in members of the public, one who has dared look beyond the veil of normality at the rotten core of corruption at the heart of our political and economic world.\n\nBut I dare say that for every one of us who are aware of the Bilderberg group and its significance, there are many thousands more who have still never even heard of it. These are the unfortunate victims of propaganda and brainwashing, the 24/7 exhortations to \u201cgo home, there\u2019s nothing to see here.\u201d We all know people like this; the ones who don\u2019t know what the Bilderburger with Cheese Group is and don\u2019t want to know. After all, why should they care?\n\nAll else aside, then, there are at least two reasons why we should have a decent answer to the question of \u201cWhy we must oppose the Bilderberg Group.\u201d Firstly, it\u2019s so that we have a clear, well-reasoned, cogent reply to those who ask us that question in all sincerity. Even the most propagandized can be coaxed out of their reality inversion bubble with a well-reasoned argument, after all. It worked on you at some point, didn\u2019t it? And secondly, even those of us who are aware that the Bilderberg group is something to be opposed should have a clear idea of why it must be opposed, because the answer to that question will help us to answer the second and more important question, \u201cHow should we oppose the Bilderberg group?\u201d\n\nSo, then, to the question itself. If we are attempting to communicate with those who cover their ears and hum loudly at the first sign of something that might be construed as \u201cconspiracy theory,\u201d maybe we should start with something they can relate to: their political overlords! We can point them to candidate Obama on the 2008 campaign trail, for example, promising that his government will be one of the most transparent in history. After all, as Obama himself noted: \u201cIt\u2019s no coincidence that one of the most secretive administrations in our history has favoured special interests and pursued policies that could not stand up to the sunlight.\u201d And Hillary Clinton, delivering remarks at the Transparency International-USA\u2019s Annual Integrity Award Dinner: \u201cBefore government officials spoke as openly and loudly about these issues, Transparency International was already bringing corruption out of the shadows, sunlight being the best disinfectant.\u201d Or then-newly elected British Prime Minister David Cameron: \u201cIt is our ambition to be one of the most transparent governments in the world, open about what we do and, crucially, about what we spend.\u201d\n\nYes! Of course! Transparency! Obama, Clinton, Cameron; they are all so dedicated to the cause of transparency, so concerned about the dangerous collusion of business, finance, media and government, that the very thought of the Bilderberg Group must be repugnant to them, right? It must so rankle them to learn that politicians are meeting behind closed doors with corporate lobbyists and\u2013\n\nWait\u2026What\u2019s that? They\u2019ve all attended Bilderberg? Oh, never mind then.\n\nYes, sadly for those who still believe politicians when their lips are moving, it is true. Cameron attended Bilderberg in 2013, ironically just one week after he addressed a then-brewing transparency scandal in the House of Lords. And Obama met Clinton at the 2008 conference while both were on the campaign trail. Obama even had to ditch his press corps to do so; he literally rounded them up into his plane and sent them flying off to Chicago on the pretense that he was with them. In reality, he was busy sneaking down the road from Washington to Chantilly, Virginia where the Bilderberg Group was meeting to engage in closed-door negotiations with Clinton. It is widely believed that the hotly-contested Democratic primary was really decided then and there at Bilderberg, with Hillary dropping out of the race shortly thereafter. So, in other words, we can at the very least point to the discrepancy between these political puppets\u2019 high-minded ideals and their actual actions. Hopefully even the most deluded of the head-in-the-sand crowd will understand that these people can\u2019t be trusted behind closed doors.\n\nOf course, it isn\u2019t just about trust (although they frame it that way). These meetings are actually illegal in the US. As Global Research points out:\n\n\u201cUnder the Logan Act, a US law passed during the infancy of the country by President John Adams, American citizens cannot negotiate with foreign officials without the authorization of the country. According to the text of the Logan Act of 1799, \u2018Any citizen of the United States, wherever he may be, who, without authority of the United States, directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.'\u201d\n\nThat seems pretty cut and dry. Every American official talking about politically sensitive subjects behind closed doors with other nations\u2019 officials in non-official capacities should be paying hefty fines if not spending time behind bars. Of course, the Logan Act has never been used in the modern era and isn\u2019t likely to be enforced now, but it is important to note that what they are doing is still technically a felony under US law. And in those countries that don\u2019t have a similar law, citizens concerned with transparency might want to ask themselves why that is.\n\nBut still some will argue, \u201cSo what? Why should we care about these meetings? So a couple of deals get made between the old boys club members. What else is new?\u201d\n\nIn order to understand how to respond to this, we need to look at the roots of the Bilderberg group. We could go back as far as the Second World War, when the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) used the disarray caused by war to set up their War and Peace Study Group. The group sought to advise the State Department on foreign policy issues and advocated the creation of a State Department committee (to be supplied with research by the CFR, of course) to work on the issue. In March 1942, they got their wish: the Advisory Committee on Postwar Foreign Policy was born. In their capacity as official advisors to the government, the CFR\u2019s War and Peace Studies Group successfully argued for the creation of a number of institutions, including the World Bank and IMF, which were set up after the war. The group also argued for the creation of a trans-Atlantic talking shop to foster dialogue (and, eventually, forge a common foreign policy) between the US and Europe. This is one of the kernels for what ultimately became the Bilderberg group.\n\nThe group itself was initiated by a number of people in 1954. Perhaps the best known of the Bilderberg founders was Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands. He was long accused of having dark Nazi ties in his past, and he dutifully denied those allegations all his life. But in 2010 a Dutch historian uncovered documents proving he was a member of the Nazi fraternity Deutsche Studentenschaft, the Nazi NSDAP and its paramilitary wing, the Sturmabteilung. These connections have been downplayed by those who point to his wartime record, but in 2007 a major scandal erupted when Dutch journalists uncovered documents showing that he used his position on the board of KLM to petition Switzerland to help Nazis escape to South America after the war. It\u2019s also significant that he resigned his Nazi memberships in 1934 when he joined German chemical giant, IG Farben. This is significant because it was recently revealed that in August of 1944 the Nazis convened a meeting in the Maison Rouge Hotel in Strasbourg with their top industrial and business leaders, including representatives for IG Farben, to detail a plan for Nazi survival in a post-WWII Europe and the eventual rise of a Fourth Reich, which was to be a pan-European financial empire. This was at least one of the roots for the European Union.\n\nAnother key Bilderberg founder was the otherwise obscure Polish diplomat J\u00f3zef Retinger. Retinger, meanwhile, was a key member of the European movement that spawned the European Union. He was one of the people who initiated the first Bilderberg meeting in 1954 and brought Prince Bernhard on board with the idea, along with then-CIA head Walter Bedell Smith, former Belgian Prime Minister Paul Van Zeeland and others.\n\nFrom its very inception at the first meeting at the Hotel Bilderberg in 1954, there was absolutely no question what this conference was aiming at: the merging of the political, economic and social institutions of the Atlantic nations in a fascistic corporate regional governmental structure. At first the topic was broached tentatively, as when American representative Gardner Cowles complained in the first ever Bilderberg meeting in 1954 that America and Europe had divergent foreign policy stances toward Asia.\n\nIt did not take long before the Bilderbergers began raising these tentative points in a more forceful manner, however. In 1955, they laid out an even more ambitious agenda. Leaked documents show the attendees talked frankly about the \u201cPressing need to bring the German people, together with the other peoples of Europe, into a common market.\u201d Note the reference to Germany, a call back to the Nazi Red House meeting in 1944 for the creation of a pan-European Fourth Reich in the creation of a common European market. The leaked documents also show that at that 1955 meeting the Bilderbergers discussed a plan \u201cTo arrive in the shortest possible time at the highest degree of integration, beginning with a common European market.\u201d Just two years after that meeting the Treaty of Rome was signed, creating the European Economic Community, an event which is now officially considered by the European Union as the formative event of the European Union. Lest there be any doubt what group was influential in bringing this about, many of the signers and negotiators of that document, including Paul-Henri Spaak, were Bilderberg members.\n\nIn the 1990s the final cherry was placed on the EU Sunday with the creation of the Euro itself. We do not have to go far to discover the Bilderberg hand in this process, either. In 2009, former EU Commissioner Etienne Davignon told the EUObserver: \u201cWhen we were having debates on the euro, people [at the Bilderberg conference] could explain why it was worth taking risks and the others, for whom the formal policy was not to believe in it, were not obliged not to listen and had to stand up and come up with real arguments.\u201d\n\nNow the next logical step is being taken to connect the regional government that the Bilderberg helped to create, the European Union, with its Trans-Atlantic partner, the US. This next step is being called the TTIP, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, a Trans-Atlantic counterpart to the equally secretive Trans-Pacific Partnership that is seeking to create a free trade pact in the Asia-Pacific region. The TTIP has been called by Bilderberg attendee David Cameron as \u201cthe biggest bilateral trade deal in history\u201d and it is being hammered out, naturally, at meetings like the Bilderberg, where some of the key players in this alliance are gathering behind closed doors as we speak.\n\nAre there still those arguing, \u201cSo what?\u201d Are they still pointing out that boys will be boys and wheelers and dealers will be wheelers and dealers? Stating that it\u2019s obvious that meetings like the Bilderberg Group take place all the time, so what\u2019s so special about them?\n\nWe could answer these people in two ways: Firstly, the agenda of the Bilderberg group is aggressively and explicitly corporate fascist in nature. At the 1968 Bilderberg conference in Canada, George Ball gave a talk entitled \u201cInternationalization of Business.\u201d Ball knew of what he spoke; he was an Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs under Kennedy and Johnson, a Senior Managing Director for Lehman Bros. and Kuhn Loeb Inc, and a member of the exclusive Bilderberg Steering Committee. The speech was chilling in its scope and implications, laying out a concept of a new world economic order based on the concept of a world company. It required the elimination of the nation state as a prerequisite to the implementation of the plan. As Ball himself asked, according to the meeting\u2019s transcripts: \u201cWhere does one find a legitimate base for the power of corporate managements to make decisions that can profoundly affect the economic life of nations to whose governments they have only limited responsibility?\u201d This is the Bilderberg vision of globalization; not the friendly trade and cooperation that they like to sell it as, but as the global fascistic takeover of the world\u2019s resources by the rich and powerful that it really is.\n\nThe other thing to note about this process is that it is aggressively and unashamedly conspiratorial. 150 of the wealthiest and richest people in the Western world are meeting in total secrecy right now, insisting that they have the right (in contravention of law, even) to wheel, deal and come to agreements behind closed doors. This secrecy has been essential to the Bilderberg group since its founding. Prince Bernhard spoke passionately about the topic of secrecy at the first ever Bilderberg meeting in 1954. He stressed how important it was to what the group wanted to accomplish that secrecy be maintained.\n\nThis is where we come to the real purpose of this exploration, not just why we should oppose Bilderberg, but how we can do it. As expected, our understanding of the group, its history and its aims helps us come to a simple realization about its Achilles heel: if Bilderberg\u2019s existence is predicated on secrecy, then its downfall hinges on exposure.\n\nWe have made great strides in that regard in recent years, thanks in large part to the work of the pioneers who reported on the Bilderberg group tirelessly, relentlessly and thanklessly for decades. Thanks to the legwork of journalists like the late Westbrook Pegler and Jim Tucker, we were able to find out not only about the group\u2019s existence, but, thanks to well-cultivated sources within the group, details of what was being discussed in those meetings.\n\nNow, the burden falls to a new generation of activists. Charlie Skelton, Dan Dicks, Luke Rudkowski. You might have seen that Dicks and Rudkowski were arrested for daring to approach some of the Bilderbergers in the days before the 2014 Bilderberg conference began. Skelton had a life-changing experience being hounded by police and secret service agents when he first went to cover the conference in Greece. The group continues to persecute those who try to expose what they are doing.\n\nBut we have a secret weapon: You. Me. All of us. They may be able to take us down individually, and they likely will be able to marginalize our dissent if we remain small, isolated, in a state of powerlessness. But they cannot stop all of us working in our own way to contribute to the exposure of their agenda. Singly, we are divided and powerless. But together we are stronger than they could ever be.\n\nThere are billions of us, 150 of them. What are we really scared of, anyway? Won\u2019t you join us in moving beyond the question of why we are opposing Bilderberg and toward an understanding of how best to expose the group and derail its agenda?\n\nFiled in: Articles\n\n", "domain": "www.corbettreport.com", "label": 0, "url": "https://www.corbettreport.com/why-we-must-oppose-bilderberg-transcript/"}

Bush has put the United States on a course that is so bleak that few analysts have \u2013 as the saying goes \u2013 connected the dots. If they had, they would see an outline of a future that mixes constant war overseas with abridgment of constitutional freedoms at home, a picture drawn by a politician who once joked, \"If this were a dictatorship, it would be a heck of a lot easier \u2013 so long as I'm the dictator.\" Click for Printable Version\n\nThe dots are certainly there. Bush's speech at West Point on June 1 asserted a unilateral U.S. right to overthrow any government in the world that is deemed a threat to American security, a position so sweeping that it lacks historical precedent. \"If we wait for threats to fully materialize, we will have waited too long,\" Bush said in describing what he calls a \"new doctrine\" and what some acolytes have dubbed the \"Bush Doctrine.\"\n\n\n\nIn a domestic corollary to this Bush Doctrine, Bush is asserting his personal authority to strip even U.S. citizens of due-process rights if he judges them \"enemy combatants.\" With Vice President Dick Cheney and Attorney General John Ashcroft warning critics not to question Bush's policy, it's not too big a jump to see a future where there will be spying on dissenters and limits on public debate, especially now that Ashcroft has lifted restrictions on FBI surveillance activities. That possibility would grow if the Republicans succeed in regaining control of the Senate and place more of Bush's conservative political allies in the federal courts.\n\n\n\nBush's grim vision is of a modern \"crusade,\" as he once put it, with American military forces striking preemptively at \"evil-doers\" wherever they live, while U.S. citizens live under a redefined Constitution with rights that can be suspended selectively by one man. Beyond the enormous sacrifices of blood, money and freedom that this plan entails, there is another problem: the strategy offers no guarantee of greater security for Americans and runs the risk of deepening the pool of hatred against the United States.\n\n\n\nWith his cavalier tough talk, Bush continues to show no sign that he grasps how treacherous his course is, nor how much more difficult it will be if the U.S. alienates large segments of the world's population.\n\n\n\nGoodwill Lost\n\n\n\nOne of the most stunning results of Bush's behavior over the past nine months has been the dissipation of the vast reservoir of goodwill that sprang up toward the United States in the days after Sept. 11. In cities all over the world, people spontaneously carried flowers to the sidewalks outside U.S. embassies and joined in mourning for the more than 3,000 people murdered in New York, at the Pentagon and in Pennsylvania. I joined a kind of pilgrimage in Copenhagen, Denmark, as people carried bouquets, a New York Yankees cap and other symbols of sympathy to the U.S. Embassy. More substantively, governments around the globe opened their files to help U.S. authorities hunt down those behind the murders.\n\n\n\nEuropean nations, which earlier had been alarmed by Bush's tendency toward unilateralism, hoped the inexperienced president would gain an appreciation for multilateral approaches toward addressing root causes of global problems and finding ways to create a more livable world. Some Europeans, for instance, thought Bush might reverse his repudiation of the Kyoto agreement, which seeks to curb global warming and avoid economic dislocations that would follow dramatic climate changes.\n\n\n\nBush, however, appears to have learned the opposite lesson. He's grown more disdainful of international opinion. He seems intent on throwing American weight around and demanding that other nations follow whatever course he chooses. As for global warming, his administration now has accepted the scientific evidence that human activity is contributing to a dangerous heating of the planet, but he continues to favor \u201cvoluntary\u201d approaches to the problem and opposes collaborating with other nations to limit emissions to retard those trends.\n\n\n\nOn the war against terrorism, Bush has asserted that he will judge whether another country is \"with us, or you are with the terrorists.\" [Sept. 20, 2001] If a country picks the wrong side, Bush will decide when, how or if that country's government will be overthrown. Bush started with Afghanistan before fingering the \"axis\n\nof evil\" states: Iraq, Iran and North Korea. His supporters have lobbied to expand the list to add nations as diverse as Syria, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Cuba.\n\n\n\nBush's actions have alarmed traditional U.S. allies in Western Europe. To them, the first clear post-Sept. 11 signal that Bush still had little interest in multilateral cooperation was his disregard of international concerns over the treatment of prisoners locked in open cages at Camp X-Ray on the U.S. military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\n\n\nBush drew criticism from the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights when he effectively waived the Third Geneva Convention's protections of prisoners of war. The Bush administration announced that contrary to the Convention's provisions, the United States would unilaterally declare which Guantanamo prisoners qualify for POW status and which POW protections they would enjoy. [See Consortiumnews.com's Bush's Return to Unilateralism, Feb. 18, 2002]\n\n\n\nSince then, the administration has ignored or renounced a string of international agreements. Bush formally withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which had been a bulwark of arms control since 1972. He flouted the nuclear non-proliferation treaty by pointing nuclear warheads at non-nuclear states. He breached World Trade Organization rules by erecting tariffs for foreign steel.\n\n\n\nTargeting Individuals\n\n\n\nBeyond those policy rebuffs to multilateralism, Bush went on the offensive against individual U.N. officials who have not conformed to his administration's desires. These officials, who insisted on holding Bush to standards applied to other leaders around the world, soon found themselves out of jobs.\n\n\n\nU.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary C. Robinson, was the first to experience the administration's displeasure. The former Irish president's efforts had won acclaim from human rights groups around the world. But her fierce independence, which surfaced in her criticism of Israel and Bush's war on terror, rubbed Washington the wrong way. The Bush administration lobbied hard against her reappointment. Officially, she was retiring on her own accord. [http://www.inthesetimes.com/issue/26/14/feature1.shtml]\n\n\n\nThe Bush administration also forced out Robert Watson, the chairman of the U.N.-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC]. Under his leadership, the panel had reached a consensus that human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, contributed to global warming. Bush has resisted this science, which also is opposed by oil companies such as ExxonMobil. The oil giant sent a memo to the White House asking the administration, \"Can Watson be replaced now at the request of the U.S.?\" [http://www.foreignpolicy-infocus.org/commentary/2002/0204un_body.html]\n\n\n\nThe ExxonMobil memo, obtained by the Natural Resources Defense Council through the Freedom of Information Act, urged the White House to \"restructure U.S. attendance at the IPCC meetings to assure no Clinton/Gore proponents are involved in decisional activities.\" On April 19, ExxonMobil got its wish. The administration succeeded in replacing Watson with Rajendra Pachauri, an Indian economist. Commenting on his removal, Watson said, \"U.S. support was, of course, an important factor. They [the IPCC] came under a lot of pressure from ExxonMobil who asked the White House to try and remove me.\" [Independent, April 20, 2002] The next to go, on April 22, was Jose Mauricio Bustani, the head of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons [OPCW]. Bustani ran into trouble when he resisted Bush administration efforts to dictate the nationalities of inspectors assigned to investigate U.S. chemical facilities. He also opposed a U.S. law allowing Bush to block unannounced inspections in the United States. Bustani came under criticism for \"bias\" because his organization had sought to inspect American chemical facilities as aggressively as it examined facilities of U.S.-designated \"rogue states.\" In other words, he was called biased because he sought to apply the rules evenhandedly. [http://www.inthesetimes.com/issue/26/14/feature1.shtml]\n\n\n\nThe final straw for Bush apparently was Bustani's efforts to persuade Iraq to join the Chemical Weapons Convention, which would allow the OPCW to inspect Iraqi facilities. The Bush administration denounced this move an \"ill-considered initiative\" and pushed to have Bustani deposed, threatening to withhold dues to the OPCW if Bustani remained. Critics said Washington's reasoning was that Bush would be stripped of a principal rationale for invading Iraq and ousting Saddam Hussein if the Iraqi dictator agreed to join the international body designed to inspect chemical-weapons facilities, including those in Iraq. A senior U.S. official dismissed that interpretation of Bush's motive as \"an atrocious red herring.\" Accusing Bustani of mismanagement, U.S. officials called an unprecedented special session to vote Bustani out, only a year after he was unanimously reelected to another five-year term. The member states chose to sacrifice Bustani to save the organization from the loss of U.S. funds. [Christian Science Monitor, April 24, 2002]\n\n\n\n\"By dismissing me,\" Bustani told the U.N. body, \"an international precedent will have been established whereby any duly elected head of any international organization would at any point during his or her tenure remain vulnerable to the whims of one or a few major contributors.\" He said that if the United States succeeded in removing him, \"genuine multilateralism\" would succumb to \"unilateralism in a multilateral disguise.\" [http://www.opcw.org/SS1CSP/SS1CSP_DG_statement.html]\n\n\n\nWorld Cooperation\n\n\n\nDespite Bush's success bending some international organizations to his will, Europe and other parts of the world have continued to promote multilateral strategies, even over Bush's objections.\n\n\n\nOn April 11, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court was ratified by enough countries to make the court a reality. Treaty ratification surged past the necessary 60 countries with the approval of Bosnia-Herzogovina, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ireland, Jordan, Mongolia, Niger, Romania and Slovakia -- to go along with the support of all the nations of Western Europe and virtually every major U.S. ally.\n\n\n\nTaking effect on July 1 \u2013 with an inaugural ceremony of the International Criminal Court expected as early as February 2003 \u2013 the court will try people accused of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. Amnesty International has called the court \"a historic development in the fight for justice.\" Human Rights Watch has called it \"the most important new institution for enforcing human rights in 50 years.\"\n\n\n\nReacting hostilely to the Rome Statute's ratification, Bush reiterated his opposition and repudiated President Clinton's decision to sign the accord. \"The United States has no legal obligations arising from its signature on Dec. 31, 2000,\" the Bush administration said in a May 6 letter to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan. \"The United States requests that its intention not to become a party \u2026 be reflected in the depositary's status lists relating to this treaty.\" [http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2002/9968.htm]\n\n\n\nWhile the \"unsigning\" was a remarkable snub at the world's diplomats and at principles of civilized behavior that the U.S. has long championed, it will not itself stop the court's creation, nor does it legally absolve the United States from cooperating with it. But the letter does signal Bush's intent to undermine the court at every turn.\n\n\n\nWith strong administration support, House Republicans promoted a bill that would allow U.S. armed forces to invade the Hague, Netherlands, where the court will be located, to rescue U.S. soldiers if they are ever prosecuted for war crimes. The bill, sponsored by House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, would bar U.S. military aid to countries that ratify the treaty. The bill also would prevent the U.S. from participating in peacekeeping missions that might put American soldiers under the court's jurisdiction. DeLay's bill even would prohibit the U.S. from sharing intelligence with the court regarding suspects being investigated or prosecuted. [http://www.wfa.org/issues/wicc/wicc.html]\n\n\n\nThe Bush administration's active campaign against the court places the U.S. alongside only one other country, Libya.\n\n\n\nContrasting Principles\n\n\n\nWashington's opposition to the court contrasts, too, with the staunch U.S. support for the war crimes tribunal that was created to try former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. In that case, the U.S. threatened to withhold financial aid to Yugoslavia if it did not hand over Milosevic and cooperate with the tribunal.\n\n\n\nWhen Yugoslavia complied, Bush hailed the move as \"a first step toward trying him for the crimes against humanity with which he is charged.\" Bush's opposition to a permanent war crimes court seems driven by fear that his freedom to wage war around the world might be proscribed by fear of war-crime charges.\n\n\n\nBush's selective unilateralism has sparked anti-Americanism even among former close allies. Reflecting the widespread view that Bush is asserting an American exceptionalism disdainful of world opinion, critics have come to routinely refer to the United States as \"the empire.\" During his May trip to Europe, demonstrators went into the streets to protest Bush's policies. The scene that I witnessed in Berlin in late May was almost the opposite of what I had observed in Copenhagen in mid-September. Instead of a warm affection for the United States, there was ridicule and contempt.\n\n\n\nAt the \u201cCowgirls and Cowboys Against the War\u201d protest march in Berlin, demonstrators wearing cowboy outfits followed a truck with a country music band mocking Bush\u2019s Wild West approach to foreign relations. At the protest, I saw people holding signs that read, \u201cGeorge W. Bush: Usurper, Oil Chieftain, Super-terrorist\u201d and \u201cBush: System Robot.\u201d Another sign I saw had a photograph of Bush with a goofy expression on his face and a caption reading, \u201cDo you really want this man to lead us into war?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe estimates of the Berlin protests ranged from 20,000 to 50,000 people. But it is clear from opinion polls and press commentaries that the protesters were expressing sentiments widely held in Europe. According to European polls, approval ratings of Bush\u2019s international policies hover at around 35 percent. [http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?ReportID=153]\n\n\n\nMany Europeans believe Bush offers only lip service to the American ideal of democracy. Not only is Bush building alliances with undemocratic human rights violators, such as Uzbekistan and Georgia, but Bush's diplomats were supportive when coup plotters briefly ousted the elected president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, on April 12.\n\n\n\nThe Bush administration viewed Chavez as a troublesome populist who threatened the stability of Venezuela's oil industry. Washington retreated only when Chavez backers poured into the streets and reversed the coup.\n\n\n\nLimiting Freedoms\n\n\n\nNow, Bush has established a domestic corollary to the worldwide \"Bush Doctrine.\" Along with asserting his unilateral power abroad, Bush is limiting freedoms within the United States. The expansion of police powers began immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks when Middle Easterners living in the U.S. were swept off the streets and held incommunicado as \"material witnesses\" or for minor visa violations. Attorney General Ashcroft likened their detentions to arresting gangsters for \"spitting on the sidewalk.\"\n\n\n\nThe total number and the identities of those arrested remain state secrets. Government officials have estimated that about 1,100 people, mostly Middle Eastern-born men, were caught up in the dragnet. Some legal observers outside the government put the number much larger, at about 1,500 to 2,000 people. Only one of these detainees has been charged with a crime connected to the Sept. 11 attacks, Zacarias Moussaoui, who was in custody before the attacks. [For details, see Salon.com's The Dragnet Comes Up Empty, June 19, 2002] Next came the hundreds of combatants captured in Afghanistan and put in cages at the U.S. military base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Bush refused to grant them protections under the Geneva Conventions and said they could be tried by a military tribunal established by his fiat.\n\n\n\nInitially, many Americans reconciled themselves to the array of post-Sept. 11 detentions and the Guantanamo cages, believing that the arrests without trial only affected foreigners and were a reaction to a short-term emergency. But that comfort level shrank when Jose Padilla, a 31-year-old U.S.-born citizen who had converted to Islam, was arrested on May 8 in Chicago.\n\n\n\nAshcroft announced the arrest at a dramatic news conference in Moscow more than a month later, on June 10. Ashcroft depicted Padilla's capture as a major victory in the war on terror. Administration officials said Padilla had met with al-Qaeda operatives abroad and was in the early stages of a plot to develop a radiological \"dirty bomb\" that would be detonated in a U.S. city.\n\n\n\nBut Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said later that the bomb plot amounted only to \"some fairly loose talk.\" [Washington Post, June 13, 2002] Nothing concrete had occurred. Padilla had no bomb-making materials, no target, no operational co-conspirators, no plan. Beyond assertions, the administration offered no evidence of Padilla's guilt.\n\n\n\nBush described Padilla as an \"enemy combatant\" and ordered him detained indefinitely at a military prison in South Carolina. No trial, not even one before the military tribunal, is to be held. Attempting to justify this extra-constitutional detention, Bush explained that Padilla is a \u201cbad guy\u201d and \u201che is where he needs to be, detained.\u201d The Bush administration said Padilla would be jailed for as long as the war on terrorism continues, potentially a life sentence given the vague goals and indefinite timetable of this conflict. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/americas/newsid_2039000/2039214.stm]\n\n\n\nEven though the Clinton administration had succeeded in winning convictions against both Islamic and domestic terrorists in open court, Bush was demonstrating his Clint-Eastwood-style impatience for such legal niceties.\n\n\n\nThough many Americans may feel little sympathy for Padilla, a street tough who allegedly consorted with al-Qaeda terrorists, the principle behind the case is clear: Bush is arrogating to himself the unilateral right to judge whether an American citizen is part of a terrorist cabal and thus can be stripped of all constitutional rights.\n\n\n\nUnder this precedent, a U.S. citizen can be denied his right to an attorney, his right to a speedy trial before a jury of peers, his right to confront accusers, his right against self-incrimination, even his right to have the charges against him spelled out. Simply on Bush's say-so, an allegation of conspiracy can become grounds for unlimited imprisonment, even with no overt acts and no public evidence.\n\n\n\nA Bleak Future\n\n\n\nIt no longer seems farfetched to think that George W. Bush might someday expand his extraordinary powers to silence those who ask difficult questions or criticize his judgment or otherwise give aid and comfort to the enemy.\n\n\n\nWhen some Democrats demanded to know what Bush knew about the terror threats before Sept. 11, Cheney delivered a blunt warning. \"My Democratic friends in Congress,\" Cheney said, \"they need to be very cautious not to seek political advantage by making incendiary suggestions, as were made by some\n\ntoday, that the White House had advance information that would have prevented the tragic attacks of 9/11.\" [Washington Post, May 17, 2002]\n\n\n\nBush, the first man in more than a century to take the White House after losing the popular vote, seems to have developed an abiding trust in his personal right to wield unlimited power. After succeeding in getting his allies on the U.S. Supreme Court to stop the counting of votes in Florida in December 2000, Bush may feel confident that he will have their help, too, in redefining the U.S. Constitution. Bush also may be confident that a frightened American populace will support his every move, regardless of how many freedoms they must surrender in the name of security.\n\n\n\nUnthinkable a year ago, there is now the shape of an American Gulag where people can disappear without public legal proceedings or possibly no legal proceedings at all.\n\n\n\nThe American people may learn too late that relying on repression to gain security can mean sacrificing freedom without actually achieving greater security. As counterinsurgency experts have long argued, only a wise balance between reasonable security and smart policies to address legitimate grievances can reduce violence to manageable levels over the long term. Often, repression simply breeds new generations of bitter enemies.\n\n\n\nOver the past nine months, George W. Bush has marched off in a political direction so troubling that American editorial writers don't dare speak its name. He is moving toward a system in which an un-elected leader decides what freedoms his people will be allowed at home and what countries will be invaded abroad. If carried to its ultimate conclusion, this political strategy can degenerate into what would be called in any other country a dictatorship. --With reporting by Robert Parry", "domain": "www.consortiumnews.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.consortiumnews.com/2002/062102a.html"}

But now Kolomoisky, whose financial empire is crumbling as Ukraine\u2019s economy founders, has turned his hired guns against the Ukrainian government led by another oligarch, President Petro Poroshenko.\n\nLast Thursday night, Kolomoisky and his armed men went to Kiev after the government tried to wrest control of the state-owned energy company UkrTransNafta from one of his associates. Kolomoisky and his men raided the company offices to seize and apparently destroy records. As he left the building, he cursed out journalists who had arrived to ask what was going on. He ranted about \u201cRussian saboteurs.\u201d\n\nIt was a revealing display of how the corrupt Ukrainian political-economic system works and the nature of the \u201creformers\u201d whom the U.S. State Department has pushed into positions of power. According to BusinessInsider, the Kiev government tried to smooth Kolomoisky\u2019s ruffled feathers by announcing \u201cthat the new company chairman [at UkrTransNafta] would not be carrying out any investigations of its finances.\u201d\n\nYet, it remained unclear whether Kolomoisky would be satisfied with what amounts to an offer to let any past thievery go unpunished. But if this promised amnesty wasn\u2019t enough, Kolomoisky appeared ready to use his private army to discourage any accountability.\n\nOn Monday, Valentyn Nalyvaychenko, chief of the State Security Service, accused Dnipropetrovsk officials of financing armed gangs and threatening investigators, Bloomberg News reported, while noting that Ukraine has sunk to 142nd place out of 175 countries in Transparency International\u2019s Corruptions Perception Index, the worst in Europe.\n\nThe see-no-evil approach to how the current Ukrainian authorities do business relates as well to Ukraine\u2019s new Finance Minister Natalie Jaresko, who appears to have enriched herself at the expense of a $150 million U.S.-taxpayer-financed investment fund for Ukraine.\n\nJaresko, a former U.S. diplomat who received overnight Ukrainian citizenship in December to become Finance Minister, had been in charge of the Western NIS Enterprise Fund (WNISEF), which became the center of insider-dealing and conflicts of interest, although the U.S. Agency for International Development showed little desire to examine the ethical problems even after Jaresko\u2019s ex-husband tried to blow the whistle. [See Consortiumnews.com\u2019s \u201cUkraine Finance Minister\u2019s American \u2018Values.\u2019\u201d]\n\nPassing Out the Billions\n\nJaresko will be in charge of dispensing the $17.5 billion that the International Monetary Fund is allocating to Ukraine, along with billions of dollars more expected from U.S. and European governments.\n\nRegarding Kolomoisky\u2019s claim about \u201cRussian saboteurs,\u201d the government said that was not the case, explaining that the clash resulted from the parliament\u2019s vote last week to reduce Kolomoisky\u2019s authority to run the company from his position as a minority owner. As part of the shakeup, Kolomoisky\u2019s prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9 Oleksandr Lazorko was fired as chairman, but he refused to leave and barricaded himself in his office, setting the stage for Kolomoisky\u2019s arrival with armed men.\n\nOn Tuesday, the New York Times reported on the dispute but also flashed back to its earlier propagandistic praise of the 52-year-old oligarch, recalling that \u201cMr. Kolomoisky was one of several oligarchs, considered too rich to bribe, who were appointed to leadership positions in a bid to stabilize Ukraine.\u201d\n\nKolomoisky also is believed to have purchased influence inside the U.S. government through his behind-the-scenes manipulation of Ukraine\u2019s largest private gas firm, Burisma Holdings. Last year, the shadowy Cyprus-based company appointed Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, to its board of directors. Burisma also lined up well-connected lobbyists, some with ties to Secretary of State John Kerry, including Kerry\u2019s former Senate chief of staff David Leiter, according to lobbying disclosures.\n\nAs Time magazine reported, \u201cLeiter\u2019s involvement in the firm rounds out a power-packed team of politically-connected Americans that also includes a second new board member, Devon Archer, a Democratic bundler and former adviser to John Kerry\u2019s 2004 presidential campaign. Both Archer and Hunter Biden have worked as business partners with Kerry\u2019s son-in-law, Christopher Heinz, the founding partner of Rosemont Capital, a private-equity company.\u201d\n\nAccording to investigative journalism in Ukraine, the ownership of Burisma has been traced to Privat Bank, which is controlled by Kolomoisky.\n\nSo, it appears that Ukraine\u2019s oligarchs who continue to wield enormous power inside the corrupt country are now circling each other over what\u2019s left of the economic spoils and positioning themselves for a share of the international bailouts to come.\n\nAs for \u201cdemocratic reform,\u201d only in the upside-down world of the State Department\u2019s Orwellian \u201cinformation war\u201d against Russia over Ukraine would imposing a corrupt and brutal oligarch like Kolomoisky as the unelected governor of a defenseless population be considered a positive.\n\n(Early Wednesday morning, President Poroshenko dismissed Kolomoisky from his post as Dnipropetrovsk regional governor.)\n\nInvestigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s.

The lead angle was a bemused observation that Ukraine\u2019s officialdom lacked faith in the country\u2019s own banks (thus explaining why so much cash).\n\nYet, Ukraine is a country beset by widespread poverty, made worse by the post-coup neoliberal \u201creforms\u201d slashing pensions, making old people work longer and reducing heating subsidies for common citizens. The average Ukrainian salary is only $214 a month.\n\nSo, an inquiring mind might wonder how \u2013 in the face of all that hardship \u2013 the post-coup officials did so well for themselves, but Times\u2019 correspondent Andrew E. Kramer treads lightly on the possibility that these officials were at least as corrupt, if not more so, than the elected government that the U.S. helped overthrow. Elected President Viktor Yanukovych had been excoriated for a lavish lifestyle because he had a sauna in his residence.\n\nKramer\u2019s article on Wednesday tried to explain the bundles of cash as a sign that \u201cmany of the lawmakers and officials responsible for inspiring public trust in Ukraine\u2019s economic and banking institutions have little faith that their own wealth would be safe in the country\u2019s banks, according to recently mandated financial disclosures. \u2026\n\n\u201cPrime Minister Volodymyr Groysman, for example, declared over one million dollars in savings in cash \u2014 $870,000 and 460,000 euros \u2014 apparently shunning Ukraine\u2019s ever-wobbly banking system. The top official in charge of the country\u2019s banks, Valeriya Gontareva, who is responsible for stabilizing the national currency, the hryvnia, maintains most of her money in American dollars \u2014 $1.8 million.\n\n\u201cA tally of the declarations filed by most of Parliament\u2019s 450 members compiled by one analyst, Andriy Gerus, found that the lawmakers collectively held $482 million in \u2018monetary assets,\u2019 of which $36 million was kept as cold, hard cash. \u2026\n\n\u201cSome politicians seem to have approached the declaration as a sort of amnesty, revealing everything they have earned from decades of crooked dealings, in an effort to come clean. \u2026 One minister reported a wine collection with bottles worth thousands of dollars each. Another official declared ownership of a church. Yet another claimed a ticket to outer space with Virgin Galactic. \u2026\n\n\u201cAnother theory making the rounds in Kiev \u2014 where people generally acknowledge the inventive, venal genius of their politicians \u2014 suggests that the public servants are padding their declarations,\u201d so they can hide future bribes within their reported cash holdings and thus offer plausible excuses for luxury cars and expensive jewelry.\n\nAccessing More Money\n\nIronically, passage of the law requiring the disclosures of what appears to be widespread corruption among Kiev\u2019s officials unlocked millions of euros in new aid money from the European Union that then flowed to the same apparently corrupt officials.\n\nHowever, because the Ukraine \u201cregime change\u201d in 2014 was partly orchestrated by U.S. and E.U. officials around the propaganda theme that elected President Yanukovych was corrupt \u2013 he had that sauna, after all \u2013 the continued corruption in the post-coup regime has been a rarely acknowledged, inconvenient truth. Indeed, some business people operating in Ukraine have complained that the corruption has grown worse since Yanukovych was overthrown.\n\nYet, only occasionally has that reality been allowed to peek through in the mainstream U.S. media, which prefers to deny that any \u201ccoup\u201d occurred, to blame Russia for all of Ukraine\u2019s problems, and to praise the post-coup \u201creforms\u201d which targeted pensions, heating subsidies and other social programs for average citizens.\n\nOne of the rare deviations from the happy talk appeared in The Wall Street Journal on Jan. 1, 2016, observing that \u201cmost Ukrainians say the revolution\u2019s promise to replace rule by thieves with the rule of law has fallen short and the government acknowledges that there is still much to be done.\u201d\n\nActually, the numbers suggested something even worse. More and more Ukrainians rated corruption as a major problem facing the nation, including a majority of 53 percent in September 2015, up from 28 percent in September 2014, according to polls by International Foundation for Electoral Systems.\n\nSo, as the hard lives of most Ukrainians got harder, the elites continued to skim off whatever cream was left, including access to billions of dollars in the West\u2019s foreign assistance that has kept the economy afloat.\n\nThere was, for instance, the case of Finance Minister Natalie Jaresko, who was regarded by many pundits as the face of Ukraine\u2019s reform before departing last April after losing out in a power struggle.\n\nYet, Jaresko was hardly a paragon of reform. Prior to getting instant Ukrainian citizenship and becoming Finance Minister in December 2014, she was a former U.S. diplomat who had been entrusted to run a $150 million U.S.-taxpayer-funded program to help jump-start an investment economy in Ukraine and Moldova.\n\nJaresko\u2019s compensation was capped at $150,000 a year, a salary that many Americans \u2013 let alone Ukrainians \u2013 would envy, but it was not enough for her. So, she engaged in a variety of maneuvers to evade the cap and enrich herself by claiming millions of dollars in bonuses and fees.\n\nUltimately, Jaresko was collecting more than $2 million a year after she shifted management of the Western NIS Enterprise Fund (WNISEF) to her own private company, Horizon Capital, and arranged to get lucrative bonuses when selling off investments, even as the overall WNISEF fund was losing money, according to official records.\n\nFor instance, Jaresko collected $1.77 million in bonuses in 2013, according to a WNISEF filing with the Internal Revenue Service. In her financial disclosure forms with the Ukrainian government, she reported earning $2.66 million in 2013 and $2.05 million in 2014, thus amassing a sizeable personal fortune while investing U.S. taxpayers\u2019 money supposedly to benefit the Ukrainian people.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter that WNISEF continued to hemorrhage money, shrinking from its original $150 million to $89.8 million in the 2013 tax year, according to the IRS filing. WNISEF reported that the bonuses to Jaresko and other corporate officers were based on \u201csuccessful\u201d exits from some investments even if the overall fund was losing money.\n\nThough Jaresko\u2019s enrichment schemes were documented by IRS and other official filings, the mainstream U.S. media turned a blind eye to this history, all the better to pretend that Ukraine\u2019s \u201creform\u201d process was in good hands. [See Consortiumnews.com\u2019s \u201cHow Ukraine\u2019s Finance Minister Got Rich.\u201d]\n\nBiden\u2019s Appeal\n\nWorried about the continued corruption, Vice President Joe Biden, who took a personal interest in Ukraine, lectured Ukraine\u2019s parliament on the need to end cronyism.\n\nBut Biden had his own Ukraine cronyism problem because three months after the U.S.-backed overthrow of the Yanukovych government Ukraine\u2019s largest private gas firm, Burisma Holdings, appointed his son, Hunter Biden, to its board of directors.\n\nBurisma a shadowy Cyprus-based company also lined up well-connected lobbyists, some with ties to Secretary of State John Kerry, including Kerry\u2019s former Senate chief of staff David Leiter, according to lobbying disclosures.\n\nAs Time magazine reported, \u201cLeiter\u2019s involvement in the firm rounds out a power-packed team of politically-connected Americans that also includes a second new board member, Devon Archer, a Democratic bundler and former adviser to John Kerry\u2019s 2004 presidential campaign. Both Archer and Hunter Biden have worked as business partners with Kerry\u2019s son-in-law, Christopher Heinz, the founding partner of Rosemont Capital, a private-equity company.\u201d\n\nAccording to investigative journalism inside Ukraine, the ownership of Burisma has been traced to Privat Bank, controlled by the thuggish billionaire oligarch Ihor Kolomoysky, who was appointed by the U.S.-backed \u201creform\u201d regime to be governor of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a south-central province of Ukraine (though Kolomoisky was eventually ousted from that post in a power struggle over control of UkrTransNafta, Ukraine\u2019s state-owned oil pipeline operator).\n\nIn a speech to Ukraine\u2019s parliament in December 2015, Biden hailed the sacrifice of the 100 or so protesters who died during the Maidan putsch in February 2014, which ousted Yanukovych, referring to the dead by their laudatory name \u201cThe Heavenly Hundred.\u201d\n\nBut Biden made no heavenly references to the estimated 10,000 people, mostly ethnic Russians, who have been slaughtered in the U.S.-encouraged \u201cAnti-Terror Operation\u201d waged by the coup regime against eastern Ukrainians who resisted Yanukovych\u2019s violent ouster. Nor did Biden take note that some of the Heavenly Hundred were street fighters for neo-Nazi and other far-right nationalist organizations.\n\nBut after making his sugary references to The Heavenly Hundred, Biden delivered his bitter medicine, an appeal for the parliament to continue implementing International Monetary Fund \u201creforms,\u201d including demands that old people work longer into their old age.\n\nBiden said, \u201cFor Ukraine to continue to make progress and to keep the support of the international community you have to do more, as well. The big part of moving forward with your IMF program \u2014 it requires difficult reforms. And they are difficult.\n\n\u201cLet me say parenthetically here, all the experts from our State Department and all the think tanks, and they come and tell you, that you know what you should do is you should deal with pensions. You should deal with \u2014 as if it\u2019s easy to do. Hell, we\u2019re having trouble in America dealing with it. We\u2019re having trouble. To vote to raise the pension age is to write your political obituary in many places.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand that those of us who serve in other democratic institutions don\u2019t understand how hard the conditions are, how difficult it is to cast some of the votes to meet the obligations committed to under the IMF. It requires sacrifices that might not be politically expedient or popular. But they\u2019re critical to putting Ukraine on the path to a future that is economically secure. And I urge you to stay the course as hard as it is. Ukraine needs a budget that\u2019s consistent with your IMF commitments.\u201d\n\nHowever, as tough as it might have been for Ukraine\u2019s parliament to slash pensions, reduce heating subsidies and force the elderly to work longer, that political sacrifice did not appear to extend to the officials making financial sacrifices themselves.\n\nInvestigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s.

Waxman disclosed the information in a letter to Rep. Tom Davis (R-VA), the Republican chairman of the Government Reform Committee, in which he called on Rep. Davis to convene hearings. Waxman's letter follows, slightly abbreviated. Advertisement\n\n\n\n# The Honorable Tom Davis\n\nChairman\n\nCommittee on Government Reform\n\nU.S. House of Representatives\n\nWashington, DC 20515\n\nDear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to request a hearing on the decision by the Army Corps of Engineers to pay Halliburton $230 million in cost reimbursements, profits, and bonuses for billings that Defense Department auditors determined to be unreasonable and unsupported. The Committee should also insist that the Corps of Engineers provide the award fee documentation for Halliburton's contract that we requested in April. The payments in question were made under the no-bid Restore Iraqi Oil (RIO) contract, which Halliburton was awarded in March 2003. Under the contract, the Defense Department issued ten task orders to Halliburton for oil-related work in Iraq, including the importation of fuel and the repair of oil facilities. Halliburton charged over $2.5 billion for this work, which is now complete. Because RIO is a cost-plus contract, Halliburton is reimbursed for its costs and then receives additional profits and bonuses. The profits are based on a negotiated estimate of the contract costs, known as a \"definitization.\" Under the RIO contract, Halliburton receives 2% of the definitized costs as an automatic base fee and up to 5% of the definitized costs as an additional award fee bonus. Based on considerations such as cost control and performance, a government award fee board or official determines what percentage bonus, if any, Halliburton should receive under each task order. Recently, without any announcement, the Corps of Engineers posted on its website the definitized value of six RIO task orders and the amount of Halliburton's fees and bonuses under each of these task orders. The posted information reveals that the Corps of Engineers appears to have ignored auditor findings in three ways: by reimbursing Halliburton for costs determined to be unreasonable or unsupported, by permitting Halliburton to collect profits on these challenged costs, and by giving Halliburton unwarranted bonuses. Pentagon auditors identified $269 million in excessive and unsubstantiated costs under the six task orders. The auditors found Halliburton's fuel importation and other costs to be unreasonably high and determined that Halliburton's cost proposals were \"not acceptable for negotiation of a fair and reasonable price.\" As a result, the auditors recommended that Halliburton not be reimbursed for these costs and not receive profits on them. It now appears, however, that the Corps rejected the auditor findings and paid Halliburton for $224 million of the challenged costs. Although between 60% and 70% of costs challenged by Pentagon auditors are typically sustained, the Corps sustained only 27% of the challenged costs in this case. The Administration has offered no explanation for this decision to pay three-quarters of Halliburton's challenged costs. Moreover, because RIO is a cost-plus contract, the decision to pay Halliburton for these challenged costs increased the company's profits by millions of dollars. Under the RIO contract, Halliburton received a larger base fee because the pool of definitized costs is larger. In this case, Halliburton was paid $2.5 million in base fee profits for billings that Pentagon auditors challenged. Compounding these egregious payments, it appears that the Corps also gave Halliburton million-dollar bonuses for overbilling the taxpayers. Two factors determine the size of Halliburton's award-fee bonus: the percentage of the award fee provided to Halliburton and the value of the definitized task orders. In this case, both appear to be inflated, with Halliburton receiving bonus awards of up to 3.4% on the challenged costs being reimbursed. In fact, given Halliburton's track record of overcharging the government, the entire $38 million in bonuses awarded to Halliburton under the six task orders is questionable. The decisions by the Corps of Engineers seem inexplicable. For many months, Pentagon auditors have criticized Halliburton's cost estimation systems as \"inadequate\" and its fuel charges as \"unreasonable.\" Our Committee should require the Corps to explain why it decided to reimburse Halliburton for challenged costs, to permit Halliburton to collect profits on challenged costs, and to give Halliburton large bonuses as a reward. With reimbursement and fee decisions still pending on four other RIO task orders, it is important that we receive prompt answers. Background On March 8, 2003, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers awarded Halliburton subsidiary KBR a no-bid monopoly contract to restore and operate Iraq's oil infrastructure. The contract was awarded in secret, and other qualified companies, like Bechtel, which did most of the oilfield work after the first Gulf War, were precluded from bidding.[1] Halliburton received the contract because it had previously been awarded a task order to prepare a contingency plan for Iraq's oil sector. The Government Accountability Office later investigated the award of the contingency contract and concluded that it was not \"in accordance with legal requirements\" because \"preparation of the contingency support plan for this mission was beyond the scope of the contract.\"[2] GAO added that the work \"should have been awarded using competitive procedures.\"[3] Halliburton charged approximately $2.5 billion under the RIO contract, which had a potential value of $7 billion.[4] The Corps of Engineers issued ten different task orders under the RIO contract. Work has now concluded on all ten task orders. Halliburton's work was split generally between oil infrastructure projects and fuel importation tasks: Task Orders 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 related to various oil infrastructure projects, while Task Orders 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10 involved the importation of fuel from Kuwait, Turkey, and Jordan. The majority of Halliburton's charges under this contract were for fuel importation and distribution. Halliburton charged approximately $2.5 billion for fuel work and $2 billion for infrastructure work.[5] There were two sources of funding for this work: approximately $875 million came from U.S. taxpayer funds and $2.64 billion came from Iraqi oil proceeds and other funds in the U.S.-controlled Development Fund for Iraq.[6] RIO is a \"cost-plus\" contract, meaning that Halliburton is reimbursed for its costs and then receives additional profits and bonuses. The profits are based on a negotiated estimate of the contract costs. The process by which the government and Halliburton agree on a cost estimate for each task order is called \"definitization.\" Under the RIO contract, Halliburton receives 2% of the definitized costs as an automatic base fee and up to an additional 5% of the definitized costs as an optional award fee bonus. A government award fee board or award fee determination official considers factors such as cost control and performance to determine what bonus percentage between 0% and 5% Halliburton should receive under each task order.[7] Audit Findings Rep. John Dingell and I began to raise questions about Halliburton's RIO contract immediately after the contract was awarded in March 2003.[8] In a series of letters, we expressed concern about the exorbitant prices of Halliburton's fuel imports from Kuwait. We reported that Halliburton appeared to be charging twice as much as it should have for fuel imports,[9] and we cited independent experts who characterized Halliburton's charges as \"highway robbery\" and \"outrageously high.\"[10] Our concerns about Halliburton's inflated costs were validated by Pentagon auditors. In December 2003, the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) announced at a press conference that it had completed a preliminary draft audit of Halliburton's fuel importation work. DCAA auditors found that Halliburton had overcharged the U.S. government by as much as $61 million for gasoline imported from Kuwait into Iraq.[11] This audit was preliminary, however, and covered only the period until September 30, 2003. In 2004 and 2005, DCAA completed final audits of each of the ten task orders. In this series of audits, DCAA identified $219 million in \"questioned\" costs under the entire RIO contract.[12] DCAA determined that all of these costs were unreasonably high. DCAA also identified $60 million in \"unsupported\" charges under the RIO contract.[13] DCAA auditors found unreasonable costs for Kuwaiti fuel under all of Halliburton's fuel importation task orders. The auditors criticized Halliburton for failing to negotiate better pricing for the fuel and transportation costs, concluding that Halliburton failed to provide \"adequate documentation to demonstrate the reasonableness of the Kuwait fuel prices over the life of the purchase orders.\"[14] The auditors also repeatedly criticized Halliburton for making unnecessary retroactive payments to its Turkish fuel subcontractors. DCAA noted that Halliburton had negotiated \"fixed-unit-rate\" and \"firm-fixed-price\" subcontracts with various Turkish subcontractors to import fuel into Iraq. During the term of these subcontracts, the market price of the fuel increased. DCAA reported that the Turkish companies asked Halliburton \"to increase the unit price of the fuel to compensate for losses due to market increases.\"[15] According to DCAA, Halliburton \"agreed to pay the higher prices retroactively.\"[16] DCAA concluded: \"We do not believe it was appropriate to retroactively adjust the fuel unit prices of KBR's fixed-unit-rate and firm-fixed-price subcontracts when there are no provisions in the subcontracts to do so.\"[17] All the DCAA audits reported that Halliburton's proposals were \"not acceptable for negotiation of a fair and reasonable price.\"[18] DCAA found that Halliburton's cost and pricing submissions were \"not adequate\" because \"proposed\" costs \"exceed recorded costs,\" because Halliburton's proposals \"did not contain data to support the reasonableness of the negotiated purchase orders,\" and because they were not prepared \"in accordance with applicable Cost Accounting Standards and appropriate provisions of FAR,\" the Federal Acquisition Regulation.[19] Moreover, DCAA criticized Halliburton for producing inadequate cost estimates for definitization. On December 31, 2003, DCAA issued a \"Flash Report,\" alerting various Defense Department agencies about \"significant deficiencies\" in Halliburton's cost estimating system.[20] According to the auditors, these deficiencies \"could adversely affect the organization's ability to propose subcontract costs in a manner consistent with applicable government contract laws and regulations.\"[21] On August 4, 2004, DCAA found Halliburton's \"estimating system to be inadequate for providing verifiable, supportable, and documented cost estimates that are acceptable for negotiating a fair and reasonable price.\"[22] I released a report in July 2004 with additional information about Halliburton's inflated gasoline charges. This report compared the price charged by Halliburton to import gasoline from Kuwait to Iraq with the costs incurred by the Pentagon's fuel importation office, the Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), to perform the same task. Because DESC assumed Halliburton's fuel importation responsibilities on April 1, 2004, a direct \"apples-to-apples\" price comparison could be made. The report found that Halliburton charged more to purchase fuel than DESC, three times as much to transport the fuel into Iraq, and 40 times as much to cover its fees and markups.[23] On April 15, 2005, the Committee requested award fee determinations and related documents for a number of Iraq contracts.[24] After meeting with Committee staff, the Defense Department provided the requested information for 20 contracts.[25] However, the Department still has not provided the requested compensation documentation for the RIO contract. Halliburton's Reimbursements, Profits, and Bonuses On November 3, 2005, without any announcement, the Corps of Engineers posted on its website the definitized value of six RIO task orders and the amount of Halliburton's base and award fees under each of these task orders.[26] Information was posted for Task Orders 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Together, these task orders are worth over $2.5 billion, or about 60% of the total value of the RIO contract.[27] Information for Task Orders 3, 8, 9, and 10 was not posted. For these six task orders, DCAA had identified $269 million in questioned and unsupported costs.[28] The auditors recommended that Halliburton not be reimbursed for or receive profits on these costs. The posted information reveals that the Corps of Engineers appears to have ignored the findings of the Defense Department's own auditors. According to the information from the Corps, the agency reimbursed Halliburton for unreasonably high costs challenged by auditors, allowed Halliburton to collect profits on these challenged costs, and even gave Halliburton a substantial bonus. Instead of disallowing the costs challenged by DCAA, the Corps largely ignored the Pentagon auditors and reimbursed Halliburton for $224 million in questioned or unsupported costs.[29] This represents 73% of the $269 million in costs challenged by the auditors under these task orders. These figures are shown in Table A. Historically, between 60% and 70% of DCAA's challenged costs have been sustained. But in this case, the Corps sustained only 27% of the challenged costs. On Task Order 7, one of the large fuel importation task orders, the Corps upheld just 8% of the costs challenged by auditors. In addition to reimbursing Halliburton for challenged costs, the Corps also allowed Halliburton to profit from the challenged costs. Because Halliburton's pool of definitized costs includes $224 million in challenged costs, Halliburton's 2% base fee is larger than it should be. The company will automatically receive $2.5 million in profits for costs Pentagon auditors found to be unreasonably high or unsubstantiated. Finally, the Corps gave Halliburton a large bonus for the costs challenged by the Department's auditors. For each task order, Halliburton's award fee bonus depends on two determinations: the percentage bonus awarded to Halliburton and the definitized value of each task order. Under the RIO contract, the Halliburton can receive a bonus fee of up to 5% of the definitized value of a task order. The bonus percentage selected by the award fee board or determination official is multiplied by the definitized value to produce the final bonus award. Ironically, Halliburton received some of its highest bonuses for projects with the most inflated costs. On the two fuel importation task orders, Task Orders 5 and 7, the company was given an award fee of 3% despite repeated auditor findings of unreasonable charges for Kuwaiti fuel and improper overpayments to Turkish subcontractors. In fact, although Halliburton's fuel costs were deemed unreasonable by DCAA and have been the subject of widespread criticism, over $36 million of the $38 million bonus awarded to Halliburton are for these fuel task orders. In total, Halliburton received reimbursements worth $224 million, base-fee profits worth $2.5 million, and bonuses worth $3.4 million for the specific charges challenged by DCAA. Given that Halliburton's entitlement to any bonuses could be called into question by its pattern of unreasonable billings, the company's entire bonus of $38 million for the six task orders is also suspect. Conclusion The Administration has consistently asserted that cost-plus contracts protect the taxpayer because the government can use the prospect of raising or lowering award fees to encourage \"effective control of costs\" by the contractor.[30] Clearly this has not occurred with the RIO contract. Rather than relying on the findings of its own auditors, the Pentagon reimbursed Halliburton for $224 million in costs that the auditors determined to be excessive or unsupported. And rather than holding Halliburton accountable for squandering taxpayer and Iraqi funds, the Administration rewarded Halliburton with large bonuses and special treatment. The Committee on Government Reform has held no full Committee hearings on Iraq this Congress. In light of the mounting reconstruction problems in Iraq and the questions raised in this letter, the Committee should initiate a series of hearings into contracting in Iraq, starting with a hearing to investigate the federal payments to Halliburton. In order to adequately prepare for these hearings, we should also insist that the Pentagon produce the detailed RIO compensation determination documents previously requested by the Committee. We cannot allow the Administration to waste additional taxpayer dollars paying Halliburton's inflated costs and undeserved profits on the remaining four RIO task orders. Sincerely,\n\n\n\nHenry A.

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Khaled El-Masri, an German citizen later found innocent who was victimized by the CIA\u2019s policy of \u201cextraordinary rendition.\u201d The suit alleges that Tenet and other CIA officials violated U.S. and human rights laws when they authorized agents to kidnap El-Masri, and that his unlawful abduction and treatment were the direct result of an illegal CIA policy known as \u201cextraordinary rendition.\u201d Advertisement\n\n\n\nThe suit also charges that the three corporations that owned and operated the airplane used to transport El-Masri to detention in Afghanistan are legally responsible for assisting in the violation of his civil and human rights. These corporations supplied the aircraft and provided the personnel used in the illicit transportation of El-Masri, knowing that the transfer was illegal, according to the ACLU. More from the ACLU's release follows. # \u201cKidnapping a foreign national for the purpose of detaining and interrogating him outside the law is contrary to American values,\u201d said Anthony D. Romero, Executive Director of the ACLU. \u201cOur government has acted as if it is above the law. We go to court today to reaffirm that the rule of law is central to our identity as a nation.\u201d \u201cThe CIA\u2019s policy of extraordinary rendition is a clear violation of universal human rights protections,\u201d said Steven Watt, the ACLU\u2019s primary human rights advisor on the case. \u201cSnatching Mr. El-Masri off the street and hiding him away in a secret prison was illegal under American and international law. Keeping him imprisoned after his innocence was established was immoral by any standard.\u201d According to the ACLU lawsuit, El-Masri, a 42-year-old German citizen and father of five young children, was forcibly abducted while on holiday in Macedonia. He was detained incommunicado, beaten, drugged, and transported to a secret CIA prison in Afghanistan, where he was subjected to inhumane conditions and coercive interrogation. El-Masri was forbidden from contacting a lawyer or any member of his family. After several months of confinement in squalid conditions, he was abandoned on a hill in Albania with no explanation, never having been charged with a crime. According to the ACLU, soon after El-Masri was flown to Afghanistan, CIA officers realized that they had abducted, detained, and interrogated an innocent man. Tenet, former director the CIA, was notified about the mistake, yet El-Masri remained in detention for two more months. \u201cI am asking the American government to admit its mistakes and to apologize for my treatment,\u201d said El-Masri. \u201cThroughout my time in the prison, I asked to be brought before a court but was refused. Now I am hoping that an American court will say very clearly that what happened to me was illegal and cannot be done to others.\u201d El-Masri had planned to be present at the press conference announcing the filing of this lawsuit, and to visit Capitol Hill to share his account with congressional aides. However, when his plane landed at Hartsfield International Airport in Atlanta on Saturday night, he was denied entry to the United States by officials of the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. El-Masri was sent back to Germany on the next available flight. U.S. officials have provided no reason for their refusal to admit El-Masri, a German citizen who has never been charged with a crime. The issue of CIA clandestine prisons is receiving a lot of attention recently in the American as well as international press. Much of this attention has been generated by reports of CIA secret prisons in Eastern Europe and the recent release of logs detailing flights used by the CIA in \u201cextraordinary rendition.\u201d The lawsuit, El-Masri v. Tenet, will be filed this morning in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. El-Masri is represented by Ann Beeson, Ben Wizner and Melissa Goodman of the ACLU National Legal Department, Paul Hoffman of Schonbrun DeSimone Seplow Harris & Hoffman, LLP, Rebecca Glenberg of the ACLU of Virginia, and Victor Glasberg of Victor M. Glasberg & Associates.

Instead, careerism is the order of the day among journalists, intelligence analysts and international monitors \u2013 meaning that almost no one who might normally be relied on to tell the truth can be trusted.\n\nThe dangerous reality is that this careerism, which often is expressed by a smug certainty about whatever the prevailing groupthink is, pervades not just the political world, where lies seem to be the common currency, but also the worlds of journalism, intelligence and international oversight, including United Nations agencies that are often granted greater credibility because they are perceived as less beholden to specific governments but in reality have become deeply corrupted, too.\n\nIn other words, many professionals who are counted on for digging out the facts and speaking truth to power have sold themselves to those same powerful interests in order to keep high-paying jobs and to not get tossed out onto the street. Many of these self-aggrandizing professionals \u2013 caught up in the many accouterments of success \u2013 don\u2019t even seem to recognize how far they\u2019ve drifted from principled professionalism.\n\nA good example was Saturday night\u2019s spectacle of national journalists preening in their tuxedos and gowns at the White House Correspondents Dinner, sporting First Amendment pins as if they were some brave victims of persecution. They seemed oblivious to how removed they are from Middle America and how unlikely any of them would risk their careers by challenging one of the Establishment\u2019s favored groupthinks. Instead, these national journalists take easy shots at President Trump\u2019s buffoonish behavior and his serial falsehoods \u2014 and count themselves as endangered heroes for the effort.\n\nFoils for Trump\n\nIronically, though, these pompous journalists gave Trump what was arguably his best moment in his first 100 days by serving as foils for the President as he traveled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on Saturday and basked in the adulation of blue-collar Americans who view the mainstream media as just one more appendage of a corrupt ruling elite.\n\nBreaking with tradition by snubbing the annual press gala, Trump delighted the Harrisburg crowd by saying: \u201cA large group of Hollywood celebrities and Washington media are consoling each other in a hotel ballroom\u201d and adding: \u201cI could not possibly be more thrilled than to be more than 100 miles away from [the] Washington swamp \u2026 with much, much better people.\u201d The crowd booed references to the elites and cheered Trump\u2019s choice to be with the common folk.\n\nTrump\u2019s rejection of the dinner and his frequent criticism of the mainstream media brought a defensive response from Jeff Mason, president of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, who complained: \u201cWe are not fake news. We are not failing news organizations. And we are not the enemy of the American people.\u201d That brought the black-tie-and-gown gathering to its feet in a standing ovation.\n\nPerhaps the assembled media elite had forgotten that it was the mainstream U.S. media \u2013 particularly The Washington Post and The New York Times \u2013 that popularized the phrase \u201cfake news\u201d and directed it blunderbuss-style not only at the few Web sites that intentionally invent stories to increase their clicks but at independent-minded journalism outlets that have dared question the elite\u2019s groupthinks on issues of war, peace and globalization.\n\nThe Black List\n\nProfessional journalistic skepticism toward official claims by the U.S. government \u2014 what you should expect from reporters \u2014 became conflated with \u201cfake news.\u201d The Post even gave front-page attention to an anonymous group called PropOrNot that published a black list of 200 Internet sites, including Consortiumnews.com and other independent-minded journalism sites, to be shunned.\n\nBut the mainstream media stars didn\u2019t like it when Trump began throwing the \u201cfake news\u201d slur back at them. Thus, the First Amendment lapel pins and the standing ovation for Jeff Mason\u2019s repudiation of the \u201cfake news\u201d label.\n\nYet, as the glitzy White House Correspondents Dinner demonstrated, mainstream journalists get the goodies of prestige and money while the real truth-tellers are almost always outspent, outgunned and cast out of the mainstream. Indeed, this dwindling band of honest people who are both knowledgeable and in position to expose unpleasant truths is often under mainstream attack, sometimes for unrelated personal failings and other times just for rubbing the powers-that-be the wrong way.\n\nPerhaps, the clearest case study of this up-is-down rewards-and-punishments reality was the Iraq War\u2019s WMD rationale. Nearly across the board, the American political/media system \u2013 from U.S. intelligence analysts to the deliberative body of the U.S. Senate to the major U.S. news organizations \u2013 failed to ascertain the truth and indeed actively helped disseminate the falsehoods about Iraq hiding WMDs and even suggested nuclear weapons development. (Arguably, the \u201cmost trusted\u201d U.S. government official at the time, Secretary of State Colin Powell, played a key role in selling the false allegations as \u201ctruth.\u201d)\n\nNot only did the supposed American \u201cgold standard\u201d for assessing information \u2013 the U.S. political, media and intelligence structure \u2013 fail miserably in the face of fraudulent claims often from self-interested Iraqi opposition figures and their neoconservative American backers, but there was minimal accountability afterwards for the \u201cprofessionals\u201d who failed to protect the public from lies and deceptions.\n\nProfiting from Failure\n\nIndeed, many of the main culprits remain \u201crespected\u201d members of the journalistic establishment. For instance, The New York Times\u2019 Pentagon correspondent Michael R. Gordon, who was the lead writer on the infamous \u201caluminum tubes for nuclear centrifuges\u201d story which got the ball rolling for the Bush administration\u2019s rollout of its invade-Iraq advertising campaign in September 2002, still covers national security for the Times \u2013 and still serves as a conveyor belt for U.S. government propaganda.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s editorial page editor Fred Hiatt, who repeatedly informed the Post\u2019s readers that Iraq\u2019s secret possession of WMD was a \u201cflat-fact,\u201d is still the Post\u2019s editorial page editor, one of the most influential positions in American journalism.\n\nHiatt\u2019s editorial page led a years-long assault on the character of former U.S. Ambassador Joseph Wilson for the offense of debunking one of President George W. Bush\u2019s claims about Iraq seeking yellowcake uranium from Niger. Wilson had alerted the CIA to the bogus claim before the invasion of Iraq and went public with the news afterwards, but the Post treated Wilson as the real culprit, dismissing him as \u201ca blowhard\u201d and trivializing the Bush administration\u2019s destruction of his wife\u2019s CIA career by outing her (Valerie Plame) in order to discredit Wilson\u2019s Niger investigation.\n\nAt the end of the Post\u2019s savaging of Wilson\u2019s reputation and in the wake of the newspaper\u2019s accessory role in destroying Plame\u2019s career, Wilson and Plame decamped from Washington to New Mexico. Meanwhile, Hiatt never suffered a whit \u2013 and remains a \u201crespected\u201d Washington media figure to this day.\n\nCareerist Lesson\n\nThe lesson that any careerist would draw from the Iraq case is that there is almost no downside risk in running with the pack on a national security issue. Even if you\u2019re horrifically wrong \u2014 even if you contribute to the deaths of some 4,500 U.S. soldiers and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis \u2014 your paycheck is almost surely safe.\n\nThe same holds true if you work for an international agency that is responsible for monitoring issues like chemical weapons. Again, the Iraq example offers a good case study. In April 2002, as President Bush was clearing away the few obstacles to his Iraq invasion plans, Jose Mauricio Bustani, the head of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons [OPCW], sought to persuade Iraq to join the Chemical Weapons Convention so inspectors could verify Iraq\u2019s claims that it had destroyed its stockpiles.\n\nThe Bush administration called that idea an \u201cill-considered initiative\u201d \u2013 after all, it could have stripped away the preferred propaganda rationale for the invasion if the OPCW verified that Iraq had destroyed its chemical weapons. So, Bush\u2019s Undersecretary of State for Arms Control John Bolton, a neocon advocate for the invasion of Iraq, pushed to have Bustani deposed. The Bush administration threatened to withhold dues to the OPCW if Bustani, a Brazilian diplomat, remained.\n\nIt now appears obvious that Bush and Bolton viewed Bustani\u2019s real offense as interfering with their invasion scheme, but Bustani was ultimately taken down over accusations of mismanagement, although he was only a year into a new five-year term after having been reelected unanimously. The OPCW member states chose to sacrifice Bustani to save the organization from the loss of U.S. funds, but \u2013 in so doing \u2013 they compromised its integrity, making it just another agency that would bend to big-power pressure.\n\n\u201cBy dismissing me,\u201d Bustani said, \u201can international precedent will have been established whereby any duly elected head of any international organization would at any point during his or her tenure remain vulnerable to the whims of one or a few major contributors.\u201d He added that if the United States succeeded in removing him, \u201cgenuine multilateralism\u201d would succumb to \u201cunilateralism in a multilateral disguise.\u201d\n\nThe Iran Nuclear Scam\n\nSomething similar happened regarding the International Atomic Energy Agency in 2009 when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the neocons were lusting for another confrontation with Iran over its alleged plans to build a nuclear bomb.\n\nAccording to U.S. embassy cables from Vienna, Austria, the site of IAEA\u2019s headquarters, American diplomats in 2009 were cheering the prospect that Japanese diplomat Yukiya Amano would advance U.S. interests in ways that outgoing IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei wouldn\u2019t; Amano credited his election to U.S. government support; Amano signaled he would side with the United States in its confrontation with Iran; and he stuck out his hand for more U.S. money.\n\nIn a July 9, 2009, cable, American charg\u00e9 Geoffrey Pyatt said Amano was thankful for U.S. support of his election. \u201cAmano attributed his election to support from the U.S., Australia and France, and cited U.S. intervention with Argentina as particularly decisive,\u201d the cable said.\n\nThe appreciative Amano informed Pyatt that as IAEA director-general, he would take a different \u201capproach on Iran from that of ElBaradei\u201d and he \u201csaw his primary role as implementing safeguards and UNSC [United Nations Security Council] Board resolutions,\u201d i.e. U.S.-driven sanctions and demands against Iran.\n\nAmano also discussed how to restructure the senior ranks of the IAEA, including elimination of one top official and the retention of another. \u201cWe wholly agree with Amano\u2019s assessment of these two advisors and see these decisions as positive first signs,\u201d Pyatt commented.\n\nIn return, Pyatt made clear that Amano could expect strong U.S. financial assistance, stating that \u201cthe United States would do everything possible to support his successful tenure as Director General and, to that end, anticipated that continued U.S. voluntary contributions to the IAEA would be forthcoming. Amano offered that a \u2018reasonable increase\u2019 in the regular budget would be helpful.\u201d\n\nWhat Pyatt made clear in his cable was that one IAEA official who was not onboard with U.S. demands had been fired while another who was onboard kept his job.\n\nPandering to Israel\n\nPyatt learned, too, that Amano had consulted with Israeli Ambassador Israel Michaeli \u201cimmediately after his appointment\u201d and that Michaeli \u201cwas fully confident of the priority Amano accords verification issues.\u201d Michaeli added that he discounted some of Amano\u2019s public remarks about there being \u201cno evidence of Iran pursuing a nuclear weapons capability\u201d as just words that Amano felt he had to say \u201cto persuade those who did not support him about his \u2018impartiality.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn private, Amano agreed to \u201cconsultations\u201d with the head of the Israeli Atomic Energy Commission, Pyatt reported. (It is ironic indeed that Amano would have secret contacts with Israeli officials about Iran\u2019s alleged nuclear weapons program, which never yielded a single bomb, when Israel possesses a large and undeclared nuclear arsenal.)\n\nIn a subsequent cable dated Oct. 16, 2009, the U.S. mission in Vienna said Amano \u201ctook pains to emphasize his support for U.S. strategic objectives for the Agency. Amano reminded ambassador [Glyn Davies] on several occasions that he was solidly in the U.S. court on every key strategic decision, from high-level personnel appointments to the handling of Iran\u2019s alleged nuclear weapons program.\n\n\u201cMore candidly, Amano noted the importance of maintaining a certain \u2018constructive ambiguity\u2019 about his plans, at least until he took over for DG ElBaradei in December\u201d 2009.\n\nIn other words, Amano was a bureaucrat eager to bend in directions favored by the United States and Israel regarding Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Amano\u2019s behavior surely contrasted with how the more independent-minded ElBaradei resisted some of Bush\u2019s key claims about Iraq\u2019s supposed nuclear weapons program, correctly denouncing some documents as forgeries.\n\nThe world\u2019s public got its insight into the Amano scam only because the U.S. embassy cables were among those given to WikiLeaks by Pvt. Bradley (now Chelsea) Manning, for which Manning received a 35-year prison sentence (which was finally commuted by President Obama before leaving office, with Manning now scheduled to be released in May \u2013 having served nearly seven years in prison).\n\nIt also is significant that Geoffrey Pyatt was rewarded for his work lining up the IAEA behind the anti-Iranian propaganda campaign by being made U.S. ambassador to Ukraine where he helped engineer the Feb. 22, 2014 coup that overthrew elected President Viktor Yanukovych. Pyatt was on the infamous \u201cfuck the E.U.\u201d call with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Victoria Nuland weeks before the coup as Nuland handpicked Ukraine\u2019s new leaders and Pyatt pondered how \u201cto midwife this thing.\u201d\n\nRewards and Punishments\n\nThe existing rewards-and-punishments system, which punishes truth-tellers and rewards those who deceive the public, has left behind a thoroughly corrupted information structure in the United States and in the West, in general.\n\nAcross the mainstream of politics and media, there are no longer the checks and balances that have protected democracy for generations. Those safeguards have been washed away by the flood of careerism.\n\nThe situation is made even more dangerous because there also exists a rapidly expanding cadre of skilled propagandists and psychological operations practitioners, sometimes operating under the umbrella of \u201cstrategic communications.\u201d Under trendy theories of \u201csmart power,\u201d information has become simply another weapon in the geopolitical arsenal, with \u201cstrategic communications\u201d sometimes praised as the preferable option to \u201chard power,\u201d i.e. military force.\n\nThe thinking goes that if the United States can overthrow a troublesome government by exploiting media/propaganda assets, deploying trained activists and spreading selective stories about \u201ccorruption\u201d or other misconduct, isn\u2019t that better than sending in the Marines?\n\nWhile that argument has the superficial appeal of humanitarianism \u2013 i.e., the avoidance of armed conflict \u2013 it ignores the corrosiveness of lies and smears, hollowing out the foundations of democracy, a structure that rests ultimately on an informed electorate. Plus, the clever use of propaganda to oust disfavored governments often leads to violence and war, as we have seen in targeted countries, such as Iraq, Syria and Ukraine.\n\nWider War\n\nRegional conflicts also carry the risk of wider war, a danger compounded by the fact that the American public is fed a steady diet of dubious narratives designed to rile up the population and to give politicians an incentive to \u201cdo something.\u201d Since these American narratives often deviate far from a reality that is well known to the people in the targeted countries, the contrasting storylines make the finding of common ground almost impossible.\n\nIf, for instance, you buy into the Western narrative that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad gleefully gases \u201cbeautiful babies,\u201d you would tend to support the \u201cregime change\u201d plans of the neoconservatives and liberal interventionists. If, however, you reject that mainstream narrative \u2013 and believe that Al Qaeda and its friendly regional powers may be staging chemical attacks to bring the U.S. military in on their \u201cregime change\u201d project \u2013 you might favor a political settlement that leaves Assad\u2019s fate to the later judgment of the Syrian people.\n\nSimilarly, if you accept the West\u2019s storyline about Russia invading Ukraine and subjugating the people of Crimea by force \u2013 while also shooting down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 for no particular reason \u2013 you might support aggressive countermoves against \u201cRussian aggression,\u201d even if that means risking nuclear war.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you know about the Nuland-Pyatt scheme for ousting Ukraine\u2019s elected president in 2014 and realize that much of the other anti-Russian narrative is propaganda or disinformation \u2013 and that MH-17 might well have been shot down by some element of Ukrainian government forces and then blamed on the Russians [see here and here] \u2013 you might look for ways to avoid a new and dangerous Cold War.\n\nWho to Trust?\n\nBut the question is: whom to trust? And this is no longer some rhetorical or philosophical point about whether one can ever know the complete truth. It is now a very practical question of life or death, not just for us as individuals but as a species and as a planet.\n\nThe existential issue before us is whether \u2013 blinded by propaganda and disinformation \u2013 we will stumble into a nuclear conflict between superpowers that could exterminate all life on earth or perhaps leave behind a radiated hulk of a planet suitable only for cockroaches and other hardy life forms.\n\nYou might think that with the stakes so high, the people in positions to head off such a catastrophe would behave more responsibly and professionally. But then there are events like Saturday night\u2019s White House Correspondents Dinner with self-important media stars puffing about with their First Amendment pins. And there\u2019s President Trump\u2019s realization that by launching missiles and talking tough he can buy himself some political space from the Establishment (even as he sells out average Americans and kills some innocent foreigners). Those realities show that seriousness is the farthest thing from the minds of Washington\u2019s insiders.\n\nIt\u2019s just too much fun \u2013 and too profitable in the short-term \u2013 to keep playing the game and hauling in the goodies. If and when the mushroom clouds appear, these careerists can turn to the cameras and blame someone else.\n\nInvestigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s.

Bannon and Jared Kushner, been pushing a plan to, in effect, privatize the war effort in Afghanistan. (In recent weeks both The Nation and The American Conservative have published deep-dive investigative pieces into the behind the scenes machinations of would-be Viceroys Prince and Feinberg).\n\nAccording to the Times report \u201cThe strategy has been called \u2018the Laos option,\u2019 after America\u2019s shadowy involvement in Laos during the war in neighboring Vietnam.\u201d\n\nIf so, then \u201cthe Laos option\u201d is an unfortunate moniker for their strategy given the fact that the during America\u2019s war over Laos (1964-73) the U.S. dropped 2.5 million tons of munitions on that country as part of the failed effort in Vietnam, which finally ended when the U.S. embassy in Saigon was evacuated in 1975.\n\nIt is worth mentioning, since we so often overlook the \u201ccollateral damage\u201d caused by our overseas adventures, that in the 40-plus years since the cessation of operations in Laos that 20,000 Laotians have been killed by unexploded ordinance dropped that had been dropped during that illegal nine-year campaign.\n\nAnd while Prince and Feinberg have (so far anyway) gotten the cold shoulder from National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster and Pentagon Chief James Mattis, momentum is picking up for once again ramping up American involvement in Afghanistan among some of the (allegedly) more sophisticated members of the foreign policy establishment.\n\nMore Armchair Warmongering\n\nOn July 11, former Deputy Defense Secretary Michele Flournoy and think tank functionary Richard Fontaine published a piece for the purportedly realist National Interest magazine that attempted to assure readers that \u201cThe Afghan War Is Not Lost.\u201d Why not? Because even though there are roughly 8,400 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, \u201cMore troops can help achieve American objectives in Afghanistan, but only if they are part of a larger and more effective strategy.\u201d [Emphasis mine].\n\nThe stress on more troops (if not to say, thousands upon thousands of unaccountable mercenaries in the pay of Feinberg and Prince) is deeply concerning because if anyone can be said to be a reliable barometer of prevailing opinion inside the Beltway it is Flournoy.\n\nReaders may recall that Flournoy co-chaired the Obama administration\u2019s Afghanistan policy review, which led to the President\u2019s ill-fated December 2009 decision to send 33,000 American troops (plus a contingent of 7,000 from NATO) to prop up the Karzai regime in Afghanistan. The following year, 2010, would end up as the bloodiest one yet for coalition forces in Afghanistan. Indeed, nearly three-fourth of all American casualties in that war took place in the years following Obama\u2019s decision to \u201csurge\u201d in Afghanistan.\n\nBut give Flournoy (who was at the top of Hillary Clinton\u2019s short list to be Defense Secretary) credit: she persists. Today Flournoy and her frequent co-author Fontaine (both are executives of the hawkish think tank Center for a New American Security) say that American should commit to Afghanistan \u201cindefinitely\u201d:\n\n\u201cThe centerpiece of the administration\u2019s Afghanistan strategy must therefore be a clear and sustained American commitment to Afghanistan. By forswearing deadlines and making clear that the United States will support the Afghan government and security forces indefinitely and until they are able to hold their own, Washington can telegraph to the Taliban that it will not succeed in retaking the country.\u201d\n\nWorryingly, some members of Congress seem to be on board. In early July, a bipartisan delegation including Senators John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Elizabeth Warren toured Pakistan and Afghanistan and called for greater military involvement in the region. Speaking on behalf of the delegation, McCain noted, \u201cnone of us would say that we\u2019re on course to a success here in Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nThe Forever War\n\nDriving the push to send more troops is the fact that, as Flournoy and Fontaine point out, the \u201cTaliban today controls more territory than at any time since 9/11. Faced with corruption and exclusionary politics, popular opposition to the government in Kabul is rising, while the Taliban makes inroads in rural areas and, increasingly, near the cities.\u201d This is no doubt the case.\n\nAnd proponents of the forever war in Afghanistan are correct when they say, as they inevitably do, that the Taliban provided sanctuary to Obama bin Laden and Al Qaeda in the lead up to 9/11. But these same proponents usually neglect to note that bin Laden and Al Qaeda were motivated by the U.S.-Israeli special relationship and, according to the 9/11 Report, \u201cgrievances against the United States\u201d that were \u201cwidely shared in the Muslim world.\u201d Bin Laden \u201cinveighed against the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia \u2026 and against other U.S. policies in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nBut, in the intervening years between 2001 and now, Al Qaeda\u2019s leadership has been decimated, and according to a Brown University study, \u201cthe United States has spent or taken on obligations to spend more than $3.6 trillion in current dollars on the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria and on the Department of Homeland Security\u201d in the years following 9/11.\n\nMeanwhile other alternative strategies (such as the \u201coffshore balancing strategy\u201d advocated by John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt) have never been tried. As I wrote at Consortiumnews in June, \u201cthere are alternatives (there always are). It\u2019s just that these tend not to have the institutional backing of Washington\u2019s policy/think tank community which, because it is deeply compromised by its defense industry funders, rarely given them voice or consideration.\u201d\n\nIf the U.S. is to successfully combat terrorism emanating out of the Middle East a wholesale re-evaluation of U.S. policy is in order, particularly with regard to Israel and Saudi Arabia. To gloss over this is to miss the point.\n\nAnd proponents of expanding and privatizing the war in Afghanistan miss it entirely.\n\nJames W Carden is a contributing writer for The Nation and editor of The American Committee for East-West Accord\u2019s eastwestaccord.com.

Carden.\n\nBy James W. Carden\n\nIn these summer dog days of the Trump presidency, good news is hard to come by, but in late June it was reported that the successor institution to William Kristol\u2019s Project for a New American Century, the Foreign Policy Initiative (FPI), was shutting its doors for good.\n\nFPI was founded in 2009 to give the displaced neocons who had worked for President George W. Bush a platform from which to endlessly criticize the new Democratic administration and push for a continuation of Bush\u2019s disastrous neocon foreign policy. (Some other neocons sheltered in place mostly inside the State Department and the Pentagon.)\n\nDuring the Obama years, FPI gave a platform to Kristol and likeminded neocons such as Dan Senor, James Kirchick and Jamie Fly, who went on to serve as a foreign policy adviser to neocon favorite Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida.\n\nFPI was generously subsidized by hedge fund manager Paul Singer. The Washington Post recently reported that \u201cThose close to the organization said that in the new policy and political environment marked by the ascendency of Donald Trump, many donors, including Singer, are reassessing where to put their funds.\u201d\n\nBut does the demise of FPI mean the neoconservatives would be, at long last, going away for a while \u2014 perhaps to take stock in the immense damage they have caused the country and the word? The answer would seem to be: not on your life. And why would they? In Donald Trump\u2019s Washington, the neocons are in high demand even though a number of high-profile neocons (such as Elliott Abrams and John Bolton) were rebuffed for senior positions inside the new administration. But neocons are finding plenty of high-profile jobs elsewhere.\n\nIn April, the New York Times announced that longtime climate change denier Bret Stephens was joining the paper as an op-ed columnist. Stephens, who came to the Times from the Wall Street Journal, has been aptly described by The Nation\u2019s Eric Alterman as a \u201cdeliberate purveyor of propaganda and misinformation.\u201d Stephens\u2019s past columns include such classics as \u201cI Am Not Sorry the CIA Waterboarded.\u201d\n\nFor its part, the centrist Brookings Institution announced last month that it was hiring neocon smear artist James Kirchick. Kirchick, who will serve as a Brookings Visiting Fellow, has used his platform at the Internet tabloid Daily Beast to smear proponents of detente as \u201cPutin apologists\u201d and \u201canti-semites.\u201d Kirchick, an outspoken NeverTrumper, also penned a hysterical (and discredited) screed accusing prominent liberals, without evidence, of supporting Donald Trump.\n\nJoining the #Resistance\n\nNeocons are also in demand at what had long been one of the more responsible foreign policy think tanks in Washington. The German Marshall Fund just announced the launch of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, which, according to its mission statement, \u201cwill develop comprehensive strategies to defend against, deter, and raise the costs on Russian and other state actors\u2019 efforts to undermine democracy and democratic institutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Alliance,\u201d read the statement, \u201cwill work to publicly document and expose Vladimir Putin\u2019s ongoing efforts to subvert democracy in the United States and Europe.\u201d\n\nThe Alliance will be run by none other than former FPI executive director Jamie Fly and a former foreign policy adviser to the Clinton campaign, Laura Rosenberger. The Alliance\u2019s board of advisers is a veritable who\u2019s who of neocon royalty including the ubiquitous Bill Kristol, along with David Kramer, Michael Morell and Kori Schake.\n\nThis is not to imply that the neocons find themselves confined to the think tank world and lack representation inside the Trump administration. Far from it. Trump has appointed several neocons to key jobs, such as United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, and the new Ukraine Envoy Kurt Volker. It is also rumored that Trump will appoint hardliner, A. Mitchell Weiss, as assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia, the post from which Victoria Nuland, a neocon holdover from the Bush years to the Obama administration, managed to do such lasting damage to U.S.-Russia relations.\n\nThe neocon revival has been facilitated by #Resistance-friendly media like MSNBC, which frequently features David Frum and Willian Kristol, two early and outspoken members of the NeverTrump movement. But perhaps what the #Resisters at MSNBC are forgetting is that the neocon-dominated NeverTrump movement was driven by the fact that, for them, Trump was not militaristic enough, which is why they threw their support behind the likes of Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham in the Republican primaries and, in the cases of Robert Kagan and Max Boot, behind Hillary Clinton in the general election.\n\nThe willingness of the pro-Hillary #Resistance to make common cause with the neocon NeverTrumpers is troubling and may explain why there has been so precious little \u201cresistance\u201d on their part to Trump\u2019s plans to expand the wars in Afghanistan, Libya, Syria and Yemen. (Indeed, Trump\u2019s April 6 missile strike on Syria won praise from Hillary Clinton, who only lamented that Trump had not done more militarily in Syria.)\n\nBut perhaps all this isn\u2019t so surprising, after all, the legions of embittered Clinton supporters never really objected all that strenuously (if at all) to their candidate\u2019s record of support for endless war.\n\nIn the end, perhaps the neocons and the pro-Hillary #Resistance are not such strange bedfellows after all. Indeed, the #Resistance\u2019s newfound enthusiasm for many prominent NeverTrumpers like Kristol and Frum helps explain the neocon revival now underway.\n\nJames W.

Blockchain Stocks Are Next!\n\nOn their mission to purge the world of thoughts and opinions that don\u2019t slot neatly into their moral agenda and worldview, the increasingly intolerant tolerance police have done some severe damage along the way.\n\nWe are frequently bombarded with headlines and hand-wringing over meaningless controversies ignited by people who, I\u2019m convinced, wake up in the morning desperate to find the next focus for their endless capacity for moral outrage. For the most part, these so-called scandals are initiated by those who identify themselves as liberals \u2014 and the lines of battle are drawn around issues of race, gender, sexual orientation etc.\n\nOur hyper-sensitive social media culture lends itself perfectly to these kinds of non-controversies, where something as simple as a badly worded tweet can, within minutes, direct a storm of abuse and online bullying toward an individual. The end result can range from a person being forced to issue a public apology for their opinion, to losing their job \u2014 or even taking their own life.\n\nThe examples are numerous, but one recent case stands out.\n\nIn December, porn star August Ames committed suicide following a tweet expressing her preference not to shoot scenes with an actor who had previously done gay porn. The tweet sparked an onslaught of abuse against Ames who attempted to defend herself against accusations of homophobia, but it was too late. The modern judges of moral acceptability had already made up their minds. Ames deserved to be trashed endlessly online for her unacceptable lapse in moral judgement. One gay porn actor, Jaxton Wheeler, told Ames to apologize or \u201cswallow a cyanide pill\u201d \u2014 as if her personal preference was so heinous that she deserved to die for it. Days later she was found dead. The cause of her death was asphyxiation due to hanging.\n\nThis is the totalitarianism and petty tyranny of the liberal tolerance doctrine at work. It is not enough to have your opinion and let others have theirs. No, no. We must all share the same exact moral standards and worship the same ideals \u2014 or perhaps we deserve to die. At the very least, those who stray deserve to face an avalanche of public abuse before repenting and falling in line.\n\nAmes\u2019 suicide is one of the more shocking stories, but there are countless examples of these moral \u2018controversies\u2019.\n\nWhen actress Lili Reinhart posted a picture of a woman in a Halloween costume \u2014 painted head-to-toe in black paint to resemble a mythical demon \u2014 she was immediately accused by other Twitter users of being racially insensitive, making fun of black people and of not seeing the \u2018racist implications\u2019 of the costume. Of course, Reinhart apologized and deleted the tweet \u2014 because that\u2019s the only recourse following such an apparently massive indiscretion.\n\nPerhaps one of these uber-enlightened individuals should release a rulebook for everyone else to follow. After all, it\u2019s a minefield out there. So, I nominate the author of a blog post which warned parents of young girls not to allow them to dress up as Disney\u2019s Moana princess for Halloween because it risks \u201cmaking fun of\u201d Polynesian culture. One can easily imagine the same blogger writing an article complaining that it was \u2018racist\u2019 if white girls didn\u2019t want to dress up as Moana. But don\u2019t be fooled into thinking it\u2019s okay for white girls to dress up as white characters, either. Later in the post, the blogger warns that girls dressing up as Elsa from Frozen risks promoting white beauty, which is also highly problematic, apparently.\n\nThe internet is littered with these petty controversies.\n\nWhen Vanity Fair recently poked fun at Hillary Clinton\u2019s long career in politics with a video that advised her to get a new hobby in the new year, like \u201cknitting\u201d or \u201cimprov comedy\u201d, it prompted yet another meltdown from the tolerance crew. You can\u2019t tell a woman to take up knitting, they roared, that\u2019s sexist! Or maybe\u2026it\u2019s just a joke? But don\u2019t be silly, jokes aren\u2019t allowed anymore. Never mind that it was a woman who made the comments about Clinton in the light-hearted video.\n\nA couple of years back, the Museum of Fine Arts Boston was forced to cancel an event during which visitors to the museum would be allowed try on a kimono. One outraged group of individuals started a website called Stand Against Yellowface to fight the terrible injustice perpetrated by the Boston museum. But guess who didn\u2019t care? Japanese people. An official from the Japanese consulate in Boston commented: \u201cWe actually do not quite understand what their point of protest is.\u201d\n\nOr how about this gem? A janitor at an Indiana university was accused of \u201cracial harassment\u201d for the crime of reading a historical book about the Ku Klux Klan on his lunch break. The book in question was Notre Dame vs. the Klan: How the Fighting Irish Defeated the Ku Klux Klan. Keith John Sampson, the 58 year-old janitor, who was also a student at the university, tried to explain that it was a history book, but that wasn\u2019t good enough for the school\u2019s affirmative action officer, who told Sampson that \u201chis conduct constituted racial harassment\u201d and that he had exhibited \u201cextremely poor judgement\u201d by reading it out in the open. You see, you must educate yourself about the history of slavery in the United States, but you can\u2019t do it in public, because that could be offensive! Are you confused yet?\n\nIn another pathetic non-controversy, Wellesley College students started an online petition to have a statue of a sleepwalking man in underwear removed from their campus. The statue was part of an art exhibition. Within hours of its placement, the petition read, the sculpture had become \u201ca source of undue stress\u201d which caused \u201capprehension, fear, and triggering thoughts\u201d for students who had experienced sexual harassment at the hands of men \u2014 although presumably not at the hands of scantily clad art installations.\n\nThen there\u2019s this guy, who thinks climate change deniers should be arrested. Or this guy, who thinks classic literature like The Great Gatsby or Mrs Dalloway should be marked with \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d lest any fragile-minded student come across a passage which might upset their sensibilities. Professors should also \u201cwarn\u201d their students, he says, about which passages in a novel may possess \u201ctriggering material\u201d and which passages are \u201csafer to read\u201d.\n\nBack in the real world, the average person will read a book\u2019s blurb, decide if it sounds appealing to them, dig in, and then, if they happen to get offended somewhere along the way, they stop reading. It\u2019s a simple process which doesn\u2019t require trigger warnings or the implementation of new reading methods.\n\nThe potential for any comment to erupt into a firestorm of controversy is so worrying to today\u2019s authors that hiring \u201csensitivity readers\u201d in advance of publication has become commonplace. A sensitivity reader provides \u201cfeedback on issues like race, religion, gender, sexuality, chronic illness and physical disabilities\u201d. Critics of sensitivity reading say that it could lead to \u201csanitized books that tiptoe around difficult topics\u201d. It\u2019s not hard to see how that could happen.\n\nThe tolerance police are afraid of the very concepts which they claim to hold so dear \u2014 like freedom of speech, choice and democracy itself. It doesn\u2019t matter to them what anyone else feels or believes. Only their version of reality counts and only their moral compass is the correct one.\n\nI recently came across a phrase I had somehow missed until now: No-platforming. It is the practice of banning certain groups from even taking part in a debate if certain cohorts find their views to be offensive. Take, for example, the fact that pro-life women were excluded from the Women\u2019s March in Washington, D.C., last year because their particular views on one issue didn\u2019t line up with the majority.\n\nYou\u2019ll have noticed by now, that the running theme in all of these stories is not tolerance, but intolerance. This overly politically correct culture of ours is churning out young adults who have been cocooned and coddled in safe spaces, who have had literature fed to them with trigger warnings, who can\u2019t handle moral or political disagreements without throwing hissy fits, who are more comfortable organizing protests against free speech than fighting for it and who have no idea how to live and let live. They\u2019ve been taught that their right to be offended and have the world fall in line trumps everyone else\u2019s right to speak or to hold an opinion.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that something as simple as a Halloween costume or a sculpture can send them into meltdown mode. The irony is, while the tolerance police are alienating well-meaning people by going after janitors for reading history books, protesting statues and campaigning for trigger warnings on books, the genuinely mean-spirited, overtly homophobic and racist people aren\u2019t getting any nicer.\n\nIt\u2019s almost like this over-the-top, aggressive implementation of the tolerance doctrine isn\u2019t really making the world a more tolerant place at all.\n\n***\n\nDanielle Ryan is an Irish freelance journalist.

It was conducted by The Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture at Trinity College.\n\nAccording to the CFI website, its mission is \"to foster a secular society based on science, reason, freedom of inquiry, and humanist values.\"\n\nMost, 70 percent, of those who said they were religious were Christian, including 31.8 percent who were evangelical Protestant, 27.2 percent who were Catholic, and 11.3 percent who were mainline Protestant.\n\nAmong those who said they were spiritual but not religious, most, 31.9 percent, had no religious affiliation, followed by evangelicals, 21.9 percent, Catholics, 12.0 percent, and mainliners, 8.2 percent.\n\nAs might be expected, the vast majority of seculars, 70.2 percent, said they have no religious affiliation. There were some seculars, though, who did have a religious affiliation. For example, 4.8 percent said they were Jewish, 4.4 percent said they were Catholic, and 2.5 percent said they were evangelical or belonged to an evangelical denomination.\n\nThe survey asked the respondents how often they attended religious services as a child. It found a strong correlation between attendance at religious services as a child and self-identification as religious while a college student.\n\nAmong the religious college students, 82.1 percent said they attended religious services weekly as a child. Among the secular college students, a little more than one in three, 37.2 percent, said they attended religious services as a child. The spiritual college students fell between those two groups at 55.1 percent.\n\nThe partisan and ideological \"God gap\" found in the electorate was also found among college students, according to the survey.\n\nThe religious students were the most likely to identify as Republicans, 38.8 percent, and conservatives, 34.1 percent. The secular students were the most likely to identify as Democrats, 57.2 percent, and liberals, 44.0 percent. A plurality of the spiritual students identified as Democrats, 44.8 percent, and as liberals, 34.9 percent.\n\nCorrection: Wednesday, Oct. 2, 2013\n\nAn article on Friday, Sept. 27, 2013, reported that the Center for Inquiry is located in Hartford, Conn.

Instead of 15 pastors, Calvary has five.\"\n\nFounded in April 1953 by Pastor John Hall and his wife Carlie, Calvary Assembly began as a small congregation of about 35 at a facility with a dirt floor originally known as Orlando Gospel Tabernacle.\n\nJoining the Assemblies of God in 1954, Calvary Assembly changed its name to its present appellation and through the 1970s and 1980s experienced explosive growth. In 1987, Calvary Assembly got its current 5,000-seat worship space built.\n\n\"To those who have only observed from a distance, Calvary Assembly is synonymous for a big building,\" reads the History page on the church's website. \"However, for those who have come close enough to know her heart, Calvary Assembly is really people\u2026.. people of all ages, from a variety of social and ethnic backgrounds, and from all walks of life.\"\n\nRather than accept the gradual decline, Carey of Calvary Assembly told CP that the congregation was making efforts to reverse the trend.\n\n\"We currently have an Interim Pastor who has been successful in helping other churches who faced declining membership. He is working with the Elders to locate a pastor who can guide Calvary to a preferred future and increased membership,\" said Carey.\n\n\"There is a renewed atmosphere of hope in the Calvary Assembly membership.

Pillar.\n\nBy Paul R. Pillar\n\nWhat is one of the first things Hamas does when it is fresh off standing up against an Israeli assault and widely perceived to have gained ground politically at the expense of its intramural rival, Mahmoud Abbas\u2019s Palestinian Authority? It voices support for Abbas\u2019s effort to get his organization\u2019s status at the United Nations upgraded from observer to \u201cnon-member state.\u201d\n\nGiven the way Hamas is routinely suspected and reviled in some quarters, this move is sure to give rise to explanations that are convoluted and conspiratorial, that what Hamas is saying is a ruse, or is just a tactic for harassing Israel, or is a step toward shoving the Palestinian Authority aside while Abbas is down.\n\nThe explanation that is simple and straightforward, and ought to be obvious, is much more likely to be accurate: that Hamas supports the creation of a Palestinian state alongside the state of Israel, and that diplomacy is the preferred way to achieve that goal. That\u2019s all that anyone who endorses Abbas\u2019s initiative at the U.N. is signing up to.\n\nAnd it is what everyone with a hand in this long-running conflict, including Israel, the Palestinians, the Quartet and the Arab League, claims to support. The Hamas spokesman said that his organization supports any political gains that Abbas can make at the U.N. \u201cwithout causing harm to the national Palestinian rights.\u201d\n\nAlthough some saw this position by Hamas as surprising, there is no reason for any surprise. Hamas has repeatedly made clear that it will support the establishment of a Palestinian state limited to the 22 percent of the mandate of Palestine that would be represented by the 1967 borders, provided that such a settlement is approved by a majority of Palestinians in a referendum.\n\nThe land swaps that are generally recognized as being necessary to accommodate some of the facts that Israel has established on the ground since 1967 represent a small step from that formula, as long as the 1967 borders are taken as the starting point for any such trades.\n\nAnd yet the government of Israel, and Americans who sing that government\u2019s tune, and much of the American media habitually describe Hamas and the objectives of Hamas as something much different. The usual formula is something like \u201cHamas is dedicated to the destruction of Israel.\u201d\n\nAttempts to substantiate such a description often point to Hamas not having formally recognized Israel and its right to exist. Well, it hasn\u2019t, but neither has Israel recognized any right of Hamas to exist (even after Hamas won a free all-Palestinian election).\n\nNot only that, but Israel has done everything it can to try to squeeze Hamas out of existence, going to the extreme of collectively punishing the population of the Gaza Strip in an unsuccessful effort to do so. It is Israel that appears to be dedicated to the destruction of Hamas. Why should Hamas be expected to bestow the first recognition, gratis, under such circumstances?\n\nOne also often hears that all Hamas is offering is a hudna or truce, rather than a commitment to a final settlement. That will be a distinction without a practical difference. The agreement that ended the Korean War 59 years ago is only a hudna, but that peace has held even though the regime north of the armistice line is far more erratic, illegitimate, and downright scary than Hamas.\n\nBesides, anyone can see, and Hamas\u2019s leaders are not dummies, that Israel, the strongest state in its region, is here to stay no matter what its borders. Even if the most extreme, negative assumptions about Hamas\u2019s intentions and objectives were true (and they very likely are not), being part of (or even being the ruling party in) a Palestinian state in that 22 percent would not bring it any closer to being able to destroy or even undermine Israel.\n\nInstead, it would have that much more to lose from the certain retaliation if it were to renege on an agreement that finally established the long-sought Palestinian state.\n\nAn upgraded status for Palestinians at the United Nations merely levels somewhat the diplomatic playing field for the bilateral negotiations that will still be needed to bring a real Palestinian state into existence, as well as reconfirming the objective that everybody involved says they share. It would thus be a positive step.\n\nDon\u2019t just listen to what Abbas or Hamas say on the subject. See what former Israeli diplomat Yossi Beilin, who helped to craft the Oslo accords, says about it. See also the statement on the subject by Gro Harlem Brundtland, who was the Norwegian prime minister at the time the accords were negotiated, and Jimmy Carter, who based on his past experience also knows a thing or two about Arab-Israeli negotiations.\n\nProbably some in Israel and the United States will see Hamas\u2019s endorsement of Abbas\u2019s U.N. initiative as another reason to oppose the initiative. If the governments of Israel and the United States continue foolishly to oppose this move and to invest political capital in trying to defeat it, we will have come in a sense full circle.\n\nThe organization that is continually accused of not wanting a peaceful diplomatic settlement will have signed on to a process aimed at moving toward such a settlement and giving it additional multilateral approval. It will be its chief accusers who fail to do so.\n\nPaul R. Pillar, in his 28 years at the Central Intelligence Agency, rose to be one of the agency\u2019s top analysts.

Shuster's father, Bud, had held the seat \u2014 and also chaired the transportation panel \u2014 prior to retiring in 2001.\n\nAs transportation committee chairman, Shuster is positioned to play a major role in the drafting of legislation to implement Trump's infrastructure plan. He met last month with Trump at the White House. The administration expects to release a detailed set of infrastructure principles in the new few weeks.\n\nShuster said in Tuesday's statement that he'll spend his final year in office \"focusing 100 percent on working with President Trump and my Republican and Democratic colleagues in both chambers to pass a much needed infrastructure bill to rebuild America.\"\n\nHis top legislative priority has been removing air traffic control operations from the government and placing them under the authority of a private, non-profit corporation. He has succeeded in winning transportation committee approval for the plan, but that's as far as the proposal has gone.\n\nShuster helped persuade Trump to back the plan, which is also a top lobbying priority of the airline industry. But the bill faces fierce opposition from other segments of the aviation industry, including private pilots and business aircraft operators, and is almost universally opposed by Democrats. Short the votes necessary for passage, GOP leaders have been unwilling to bring the measure to the House floor for a vote.\n\n\"As we look to the legislative agenda this year and work with President Trump to upgrade our nation's infrastructure and improve the lives of the American people, I know that Bill will continue to be an important leader,\" said Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.\n\nIn 2015, Shuster acknowledged a \"private and personal relationship\" with Shelley Rubino, a vice president with the trade association Airlines for America who lobbies the transportation committee. Shuster has repeatedly introduced bills and backed proposals sought by the airline industry.\n\nBesides air traffic control privatization, he also introduced legislation that would have rolled back an Obama administration regulation requiring airlines to display the full cost of an airfare inclusive of taxes and fees rather than a posting a base rate and adding in taxes and fees later.

This is understandable of course, because consistent with the laws of the jungle, if you threaten the dominant animals, they will eat you, even their own.\n\nSo this is essentially what is happening out there these days, where whether you know it yet or not- if you want to survive- the idea is not to be eaten. In the West, and in terms of \u2018technological innovation\u2019 as it applies to the financial markets, which in reality is more \u2018desperate intervention\u2019 than \u2018basic innovation\u2019 (the basic innovation was money debasement itself, discovered long ago, with all new variations attempts at deception), increasingly complex financial engineering has been the status quo\u2019s modus operandi to continue the pilfering of the masses, with negative interest rate policy ( NIRP ) the latest example. Again however, as always, the question is, \u2018how long will this variation of sterilized currency debasement last\u2019; and, \u2018if it fails, would this be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back, propelling modern men back towards our more primitive origins\u2019?\n\nThe onset of World War III (WWIII) would answer these questions readily, as competition for scarce resources intensifies into a truly \u2018dog eat dog\u2019 world. This is of course why Russia and China have been scrambling to protect themselves from these NeoCon animals, because they are so \u2018out of it\u2019 now they actually think they can profit from some kind of sterilized war (no nukes?), like NIRP (economic war imposed on both foreign and domestic targets), with the delusion factor now running so high- if the public were not so high (distracted with drugs, money, whatever)- they might be able to see clearly- making them justifiably terrified.\n\nBut the spin masters of the West will not go quietly however- I can assure you of that. The police state, surveillance state- whatever you want to call out of control fascist bureaucrats hell bent on stealing the public blind- they like life just fine the way it is, and are more than willing to take yours to keep it. Know why police have immunity in shootings, fatal and not? Because the oligarchs and bureaucrats need their dogs to protect them from an increasingly angry public.\n\nYoung people today are more aware of the fact war is just a tool of the \u2018moneyed interests\u2019 , and they will rebel. Emotions are going to explode on this issue because youthful bubbles of \u2018entitlement\u2019 and \u2018social media distraction\u2019 will quickly disappear when millennials realize the \u2018greedy old bastards\u2019 want us to die so the stock market doesn\u2019t crash. Because like the Brexit vote, the \u2018plebs are pissed\u2019, and they voted to kick the establishment in the teeth.\n\nThe status quo boys are the most desperate people in the world, so be careful as conditions are ripe for some unexpected action this year. Remember- most think the government won\u2019t let anything nasty happen. Others think the markets are too big to fail this time around. This is a recipe for disaster for these types.\u201d\n\nSource: http://coyoteprime-runningcauseicantfly.blogspot.com/2018/01/do-or-die.html", "domain": "beforeitsnews.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://beforeitsnews.com/opinion-liberal/2018/01/do-or-die-2568626.html"}

Add your two cents.\n\nHeadline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!\n\nDivers just found the world\u2019s largest underwater cave. And as if that discovery was not exciting enough, in that cave, were Mayan secrets hidden away for years.\n\nAfter 10 months of intensive exploration, scientists in Mexico have discovered the world\u2019s largest flooded cave system and it\u2019s truly an underwater wonderland. According to Science Alert, spanning an incredible 347 kilometers (216 miles) of subterranean caverns, this branching, sunken labyrinth isn\u2019t just a natural spectacle. It\u2019s also an important archaeological find that could help unlock the lost secrets of the ancient Maya civilization.\n\n\u201cThis immense cave represents the most important submerged archaeological site in the world,\u201d says underwater archaeologist Guillermo de Anda from Mexico\u2019s National Institute of Anthropology and History. \u201cIt has more than a hundred archaeological contexts, among which are evidence of the first settlers of America, as well as extinct fauna and, of course, the Maya culture.\u201d\n\nDe Anda heads up the Great Maya Aquifer Project (GAM), a research effort which for decades has explored underwater caves in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo, located on the Caribbean coastline of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The region hosts a stunning 358 submerged cave systems, representing some 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) of flooded freshwater tunnels hidden under the surface.\n\nAs footage in the researchers\u2019 video and photos show \u2013 untold volumes of preserved Maya artifacts and human remains are just waiting to be discovered and analyzed from within this unprecedented cave system.\n\nUltimately, the scientific implications could be just as massive as the cave itself.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve recorded more than 100 archaeological elements: the remains of extinct fauna, early humans, Maya archaeology, ceramics, and Maya graves,\u201d de Anda told the Mexican media. \u201cIt\u2019s a tunnel of time that transports you to a place 10,000 to 12,000 years ago.\u201d\n\nDelivered by The Daily Sheeple\n\nWe encourage you to share and republish our reports, analyses, breaking news and videos (Click for details).\n\nContributed by The Daily Sheeple of www.TheDailySheeple.com.\n\nThis content may be freely reproduced in full or in part in digital form with full attribution to the author and a link to www.TheDailySheeple.com.\n\nSource: http://www.thedailysheeple.com/mayan-secrets-found-in-newly-discovered-underwater-cave_012018", "domain": "beforeitsnews.com", "label": 0, "url": "http://beforeitsnews.com/alternative/2018/01/mayan-secrets-found-in-newly-discovered-underwater-cave-3588951.html"}

No one is as generous as He is. The gifts He gives us- the blessings, the new life, the breakthroughs and the forgiveness- are greater than any other gift anyone else gives to us.\n\nBut of all the gifts God has given, there is nothing greater than the gift that is Himself. In His love for us, He first gave us Jesus Christ as our means of redemption and second He gave us the Holy Spirit.\n\nStarting off in the walk of faith, the Holy Spirit actually scared me more than He excited me. I was intimidated by the idea of being overtaken by a spirit not of my own so I ran away from Baptism by fire. But when I experienced Him one fateful day, my life was never the same again.\n\nReceiving the Holy Spirit is not only possible, it is essential for Christ-centered living. We cannot live in and for God apart from the power, work and manifestation of the Holy Spirit in our lives. The Holy Spirit is God Himself tangibly working in our hearts, minds and sometimes in our bodies to experience God's grace here on earth as it is in heaven.\n\nIt's through the Person and Work of the Holy Spirit that God works in us to allow us to be regenerated, reconciled, empowered, guided and strengthened for the work God calls us to do. But how does the Holy Spirit work in our life? Understanding this is essential so that we know how to ask God to work in us and so that we will learn to discern and recognize the Holy Spirit's work in us. Here are just some of the roles the Holy Spirit has in our personal an corporate lives.\n\nCounselor\n\nThe Bible refers to the Holy Spirit by many names, but one of the most common names are counselor, comforter and advocate. In John 14:26, Jesus introduced the Holy Spirit saying, \"But the Helper (Comforter, Advocate, Intercessor\u2014Counselor, Strengthener, Standby), the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name...\"\n\nThe Holy Spirit guides us into truth and gives us wisdom to live our lives the way we should and cause us to love God and love others through our thoughts and actions.\n\nEnabler\n\nHave you ever felt like you couldn't physically or mentally do something but somehow you were able to do it anyway? It's likely that the Holy Spirit was working in you. God's Spirit has been known to enable men and women both in the Bible and even today to do things they would've never been able to do on their own.\n\nWhen Philippians 4:13 tells us that we can \"do all things through Christ,\" it's because Christ has bridged us with access to the Spirit who now works in us by giving us gifts, abilities and promptings that allow us to do greater things for Him.\n\nChange-maker\n\nThe Holy Spirit does not just transform our spiritual destination, but also transforms us here on earth as well. Acts 1:8 tells us, \"But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses...\"\n\nBeing a witness means so much more than just being enabled to speak in front of crowds. It also means being empowered to live lives that glorify God. The Holy Spirit is the one who changes our hearts and attitudes so that we can turn away from sin and turn to Christ.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/what-holy-spirit-do-how-holy-spirit-work-180869/"}

Instead of 15 pastors, Calvary has five.\"\n\nFounded in April 1953 by Pastor John Hall and his wife Carlie, Calvary Assembly began as a small congregation of about 35 at a facility with a dirt floor originally known as Orlando Gospel Tabernacle.\n\nJoining the Assemblies of God in 1954, Calvary Assembly changed its name to its present appellation and through the 1970s and 1980s experienced explosive growth. In 1987, Calvary Assembly got its current 5,000-seat worship space built.\n\n\"To those who have only observed from a distance, Calvary Assembly is synonymous for a big building,\" reads the History page on the church's website. \"However, for those who have come close enough to know her heart, Calvary Assembly is really people\u2026.. people of all ages, from a variety of social and ethnic backgrounds, and from all walks of life.\"\n\nRather than accept the gradual decline, Carey of Calvary Assembly told CP that the congregation was making efforts to reverse the trend.\n\n\"We currently have an Interim Pastor who has been successful in helping other churches who faced declining membership.

It was conducted by The Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture at Trinity College.\n\nAccording to the CFI website, its mission is \"to foster a secular society based on science, reason, freedom of inquiry, and humanist values.\"\n\nMost, 70 percent, of those who said they were religious were Christian, including 31.8 percent who were evangelical Protestant, 27.2 percent who were Catholic, and 11.3 percent who were mainline Protestant.\n\nAmong those who said they were spiritual but not religious, most, 31.9 percent, had no religious affiliation, followed by evangelicals, 21.9 percent, Catholics, 12.0 percent, and mainliners, 8.2 percent.\n\nAs might be expected, the vast majority of seculars, 70.2 percent, said they have no religious affiliation. There were some seculars, though, who did have a religious affiliation. For example, 4.8 percent said they were Jewish, 4.4 percent said they were Catholic, and 2.5 percent said they were evangelical or belonged to an evangelical denomination.\n\nThe survey asked the respondents how often they attended religious services as a child. It found a strong correlation between attendance at religious services as a child and self-identification as religious while a college student.\n\nAmong the religious college students, 82.1 percent said they attended religious services weekly as a child. Among the secular college students, a little more than one in three, 37.2 percent, said they attended religious services as a child. The spiritual college students fell between those two groups at 55.1 percent.\n\nThe partisan and ideological \"God gap\" found in the electorate was also found among college students, according to the survey.\n\nThe religious students were the most likely to identify as Republicans, 38.8 percent, and conservatives, 34.1 percent. The secular students were the most likely to identify as Democrats, 57.2 percent, and liberals, 44.0 percent.

I expected the corrupt politicians in power and wrongdoers would resign in three days; however, it would take us two-and-a-half years to drain the swamp in our capital, Skopje.\n\nBy the start of 2017, 10 years of authoritarian rule in the Republic of Macedonia created internal divisions and external tensions with neighboring countries including Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia, Kosovo, and Albania.\n\nThe Republic of Macedonia had become a center of geopolitical intrigue with increasing opportunities for external powers with anti-democratic values and norms to meddle in the internal affairs of our country.\n\nThe culmination of the crisis and our personal struggles for freedom and democracy came April 27, 2017. After a newly formed majority in Parliament elected a new Speaker, a well-organized mob of 4,000 thugs stormed our parliament and tried to lynch us.\n\nI thank the courage of my fellow MPs from different parties and ethnic groups and our heroic security guards, that we calmly withstood these violent attacks, heavy blows, and bloody injuries. I also thank God that none of our colleagues were killed.\n\nWe not only survived this brazen assault on our sovereignty, but endured because we are united in our belief in basic democratic values and standards.\n\nUnder my leadership, our party reached out for support to different ethnic groups in the Republic of Macedonia. Our democratic message and hard work paid off as the coalition I led in the December 2016 election received substantial support from the minority Albanian community.\n\nDuring our struggle, we never wavered from our support for civil society and cooperation on equal footing. We engaged our citizens to rise in defense of these democratic rights, freedoms and the rule of law.\n\nThe result was stunning: an electoral majority in the national parliament that opened our path toward change.\n\nThrough the will of the people, we were empowered to exchange an authoritarian regime for a government with a resolute will to restore democracy.\n\nWe managed to do what is frequently aspired to, but seldom accomplished.\n\nHowever, overcoming the crisis was only half of the story. We desperately needed to bring new perspectives.\n\nThus, we created a platform of good governance that is based on four pillars.\n\nInclusive governance is the first pillar. This means we are strongly determined to build independent institutions and a rule of law that is equal for all and to extend inclusive and accessible public services.\n\nThe concept \"one society for all\" is our second pillar. This is a civic based concept to bridge ethnic divisions.\n\nThere should no longer be ethnic and nationalistic polarization. We lead by example to implement this concept.\n\nWe have integrated Albanians in my party, in the party structures, as MPs and as candidates in local elections, and strengthened the cooperation with minority Albanian parties.\n\nIn local elections in October 2017, we gave the opportunity to Albanians to vote for ethnic Macedonian candidates and to ethnic Macedonians to vote for Albanian candidates.\n\nOur success was immediate and overwhelming. Today, I am proud an Albanian woman from my party is mayor in a municipality that was a battleground in the inter-ethnic conflict in the early 2000s. Democracy truly works.\n\nThe third pillar of our good governance platform is equitable growth. We introduced policy measures to eradicate poverty and to increase the standard of living.\n\nIn my government's first six months, we increased the minimum wage, increased accessibility of public services, introduced more programs for self-employment, increased support and incentives for small business creation and provided equal opportunities for domestic and foreign investors.\n\nToday, the government in the Republic of Macedonia is supporting up to 50 percent of any new investment in the country.\n\nIn terms of foreign investment, in early 2018, we will pass a law lowering the corporate tax rate for IT companies to 3 percent.\n\nWe expect this will attract businesses to the Republic of Macedonia and we look forward to negotiating with these companies during the course of 2018. Macedonia is open for business.\n\nThe fourth necessary pillar is to be friends with our neighbors. We are strongly committed to regional cooperation.\n\nAt the Western Balkan Summit in Trieste 2017, the Republic of Macedonia received a grant of almost 70 million Euros from the EU to build a railway to Bulgaria.\n\nIn August 2017, we signed a good neighborly agreement with Bulgaria and held our first joint government session (G2G) with Bulgaria in November.\n\nIn mid-December we had the first G2G with Albania, and in 2018 we plan to have G2Gs with Serbia and with Kosovo. And we will host the first summit on the digital economy in the Western Balkans in the first half of 2018.\n\nWith Greece we are building positive momentum to overcome the long standing \u201cname dispute\u201d that is a major obstacle for our EU and NATO integration.\n\nTogether we are engaged in a process of confidence building measures and are improving the dialogue between our two countries to find a solution.\n\nThe first results of our platform are encouraging. In our October 2017 local elections, international observers concluded elections \"contributed to strengthening confidence in the democratic process.\"\n\nMy government is strongly committed to EU and NATO integration as main strategic goals. In 2018, we aspire to open EU accession negotiations and to receive an invitation to join NATO.\n\nWe created an ambitious plan called \"3 \u2013 6 \u2013 9\" to move forward in EU integration.\n\nIt is a plan with concrete policy reforms outlined in the first three months, six months, and nine months. It is a comprehensive set of policy reforms in crucial areas such as rule of law, public administration, security services, and media.\n\nRegarding NATO integration we support President Trump's call for NATO members to pay their fair share of the NATO defense bill, and we will increase our military budget by 15 percent in 2018.\n\nWe have the political will to increase our defense spending in each successive year so we reach the NATO 2 percent target in due course.\n\nWe remain a loyal and reliable partner to NATO and to the US, as envisaged in the strategic partnership agreement our country signed in 2008.\n\nWe participated in the U.S.-led mission in Iraq and take part in NATO's \"Resolute Support\" mission in Afghanistan.\n\nWe are the fourth largest contributor per capita, and will increase our participation in 2018.\n\nThe Balkans have had a turbulent past, but we are the masters of our future.\n\nCitizens in the entire region hope for a new generation of transformational leaders that will nurture sustainable peace and stability and develop cooperation to serve their economic interests and well-being.\n\nThe government that I lead has the honor and responsibility to govern in the Republic of Macedonia.\n\nWe need to serve the best interests of our people.

A trespassing case in Vermont raised some of these questions, reports William Boardman.\n\nBy William Boardman\n\nThe Vermont justice system may have wanted just another routine jury trial on charges of criminal trespass, but for the accused six grandmothers the day-long trial was also an opportunity to bear witness, each in her own polite way, that they had acted out of conscience to protect themselves and others against the dangers of an aging nuclear power plant in particular and against the general danger of nuclear power to the planet.\n\nThat\u2019s the rather strange context for a day-long trial in Windham County Superior Court in Brattleboro, Vermont, on Nov. 27, when six Massachusetts women, aged 64-93, faced possible jail time and fines up to $500, if convicted, for padlocking shut the gate to the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plantand then chaining themselves to that gate on Aug. 30, 2011.\n\nThe women, who have been arrested often in at least 21 other protests against Vermont Yankee since 2006, freely admitted these alleged acts, denied they were trespass, and welcomed the opportunity to explain why they acted.\n\nSuperior Judge John Wesley interpreted the women\u2019s position to be an assertion of the \u201cnecessity defense\u201d and ruled that that defense was not allowed. But he also took notice that the women were representing themselves, without attorneys, and that as pro se parties they would have unusual leeway in their testimony.\n\nThe resulting courtroom scene was only part legal proceeding. It was also part political theatre, part group therapy, and part something of a spiritual teach-in, with an audience of dozens of supporters for the women who are part of the Shut It Down Affinity Group, a bi-state association of activists focused on Vermont Yankee.\n\nOne of the supporters, Dusty Miller, described her response to the trial of what she called \u201cactions motivated by conscience\u201d: \u201cYesterday, I spent the day in a Brattleboro courtroom, witnessing the trial of six white-haired grandmothers who were charged with trespassing at the gates of Vermont Yankee.\n\n\u201cYesterday, I was repeatedly moved to tears. I was inspired and challenged by the actions and the courage of the women I was there to support. Most important, I felt hope again, hope that ordinary citizens can take a stand against corporate powers who pollute our earth and water with impunity.\u201d\n\nCheckered Safety Record\n\nVermont Yankee is located on the Connecticut River in southeast Vermont, close to both the New Hampshire and Massachusetts borders. There has been regional grassroots resistance to the plant since before it opened in 1972.\n\nThat resistance has increased significantly in recent years as Vermont\u2019s governor, attorney general, and legislature have all joined in the effort to close the plant. Vermont Yankee\u2019s safety record has been uneven and deteriorating, including releases of radioactive tritium that has reached the Connecticut River.\n\nEven Vermont law enforcement, particularly the Windham County State\u2019s Attorney (county prosecutor) whose jurisdiction includes Vermont Yankee, has taken a soft approach to protesters at the site arresting hundreds of people in recent years, often including these women, but prosecuting none until this case.\n\nWhen the six grandmothers set out from Massachusetts on Aug. 30, 2011, 15 months ago, they were aware that Tropical Storm Irene had passed though New England and that it hadn\u2019t had much impact where they lived. In retrospect, one of them, Mary Kehler, 64, of Colrain, said they would have re-scheduled their long-planned protest if they had realized how hard parts of Vermont had been hit by Irene.\n\nNot knowing, they proceeded with their plan to block Vermont Yankee\u2019s main gate with non-violent civil disobedience, chaining themselves to the gate and shutting it down until they were arrested, while causing only minor disruption to the plant\u2019s operation.\n\nThis was not the first time any of them had been arrested at Vermont Yankee. They have demonstrated there several times since, most recently on Oct. 17, when police arrested 12, including four of the defendants.\n\nThe Shut It Down Six include a professor, social worker, mediator and psychologist, and each woman told her story in her own way as well as in coordination with others. Given great latitude by the judge, the women\u2019s testimony drew frequent objections from the state, some of which were upheld, some not.\n\nDeputy state\u2019s attorney Steven Brown prosecuted the charges on behalf of the State of Vermont and kept his presentation narrowly focused on the facts, which were undisputed.\n\nBarred Necessity Defense\n\nWhile Judge Wesley denied the women the right to argue a necessity defense that they had not formally asked for, he allowed them to testify expansively, between objections, so that the jury of four men and eight women ended up hearing testimony that partly supported a necessity defense without actually clarifying it directly. In essence the necessity defense involves the admission of a crime, but argues that the crime was necessary to avoid a greater crime or a greater harm.\n\nPerhaps the best-known use of \u201cnecessity\u201d in Vermont is the 1984 case of the \u201cWinooski 44,\u201d in which opponents of arms sales to the Nicaraguan Contras staged a three-day sit-in that obstructed Republican Sen. Robert Stafford\u2019s office.\n\nTwenty-six people were arrested on trespass charges in March and at their November trial they presented a necessity defense, complete with expert witnesses including historian Howard Zinn and former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark. The jury acquitted all 26 defendants and the state did not appeal.\n\nIn the Winooski 44 case, the trespass at the senator\u2019s office was justified by defendants as making it more difficult for him to support the Reagan administration\u2019s covert and illegal war in Nicaragua.\n\nBy comparison, the Shut It Down Six argued that they were trespassing in order protect themselves and their neighbors downstream, and sometimes downwind, from Vermont Yankee which continues to generate lethal radioactive waste as long as it remains open.\n\nJudge Wesley, in ruling against a necessity defense, cited a 1979 Vermont Supreme Court case, State of Vermont v. John Warshow et al., which stemmed from an earlier protest at Vermont Yankee.\n\nThat case comprises three distinct opinions from the court\u2019s five justices, with the majority upholding the trial court\u2019s denial of the necessity defense primarily because the defendants had not shown any example of an \u201cimminent danger classified as an emergency sufficient to justify criminal activity.\u201d But Justice Frederick Billings, in dissent, wrote that defendants had warned that re-starting Vermont Yankee would lead to an immediate meltdown. Someone got it wrong.\n\nAny case with this great a discrepancy in perceived facts generally goes to a jury. As Chief Justice Paul Reiber wrote in a more recent dissent in a drug case, \u201cUltimately, this is a case in which the necessity defense should be heard by a jury. Indeed, it is a case where defendant\u2019s actions cannot be explained in any way other than through a presentation of the necessity defense.\n\n\u201cAscertaining the \u2018ultimate truth or falsity\u2019 of defendant\u2019s necessity defense is \u2018the principal mission of the jury,\u2019 and the trial court should have squarely presented the defense to the jury so that they could \u2018confront it, consider it, and resolve its truth or falsity by their verdict.\u2019\u201d State v. Brisson, 119 Vt. 48, 53, 117 A.2d 255, 257-58 (1955)\n\nA Full Courtroom\n\nIt is not clear that the Shut It Down Six could have met the test for a necessity defense, had they had to address it formally. But they didn\u2019t request it, though they mentioned it and referred to Warshow, and the judge denied it, while still allowing much of their testimony, so the jury still heard enough evidence to consider it, although the judge instructed them not to.\n\nRegardless of whatever legal confusion there may have been, as one observer put it, \u201cthe whole atmosphere in the court room at least until the closing arguments and sentencing was of mutual respect and kindness; there was a good deal of humor as well.\u201d\n\nDuring the trial, Frances Crowe, a 93-year-old Quaker from Northampton, started to discuss the inherent danger of the crowded spent fuel pools at Vermont Yankee. Prosecutor Brown objected and Judge Wesley ordered her to stop. One observer noticed what she thought was a pattern, that the judge would allow no discussion of fuel rods, tornados, or Fukushima.\n\nAt one point, Harriet Nestel, 73, of Athol, commented about Vermont\u2019s efforts to control the behavior of the plant\u2019s owner, Entergy Corporation of Louisiana: \u201cThey are operating illegally. They are the trespassers, and we are the enforcers of the state\u2019s will.\u201d She could not make the further argument that her crime of trespassing was a lesser harm than the continued illegal operation of Vermont Yankee.\n\nAt another point, reinforcing his ruling against any necessity defense, Judge Wesley said, \u201cThis trial is not about the legality of Vermont Yankee\u2019s continued operation.\u201d\n\nAlthough the women said their activism had intensified since the meltdowns at the Fukushima plant in Japan in March 2011, they couldn\u2019t present evidence that those four failed reactors in Japan have the same generic General Electric design as Vermont Yankee\u2019s reactor.\n\nNor could the women introduce evidence that Vermont Yankee, by virtue of its riverside site, is one of 34 American plants that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) specifically considers at risk of flooding due to upstream dam failure. The NRC suppressed a report with those findings until a whistleblower recently released them, indicating that Vermont Yankee is a potential American Fukushima.\n\nAccording to NRC risk engineers, although the likelihood of an upstream dam failure may be low, if there is a dam failure, then the likelihood of a melt-down at the downstream nuclear plant is close to certainty.\n\nA Tropical Storm\n\nDuring the trial, Prosecutor Brown stayed tightly focused on the trespass itself, mostly avoiding motivation and context. But after the jury returned with a guilty verdict and it was time for sentencing, Brown argued for a suspended sentence of 30-45 days, on the condition of no further protests and the completion of 100 hours of public service.\n\nHe justified the difference between this request and the hundreds of similar cases that were not prosecuted by blaming the six women for taking law-enforcement personnel away from post-Irene response.\n\nAs the Rutland Herald\u2019s Susan Smallheer reported it: \u201cThe case was unusual because it was prosecuted, while hundreds of other, identical cases have gone unprosecuted.\n\nBut after the women were convicted, and set for sentencing, Windham County Deputy State\u2019s Attorney Steve Brown said the women\u2019s timing, and the fact that they pulled away needed resources from the police response to Tropical Storm Irene, needed to be computed into their sentence.\n\n\u201cWindham County prosecutors have, for the last 12 years or so, routinely declined to prosecute any protester cases, saying it was a misuse of limited court resources.\u201d\n\nThe evidence had shown that these women were well known to local authorities and that they required no special police handling. Brown did not establish that any personnel were actually needed elsewhere when they were arresting the Shut It Down Six, he did not establish how many personnel were needed for the arrests, or whether the women could have been left chained to the fence until it was convenient for police to collect them.\n\nBecause he took no questions afterwards, prosecutor Brown could not be asked whether this case constituted selective prosecution. Associated Press reporter Dave Gram raised this issue with the prosecutor\u2019s office pre-trial, but got no explanation.\n\nNor apparently did the judge inquire as to why these women were prosecuted when hundreds of other protesters similarly situated legally, had all had their charges dropped even some of these defendants on other occasions.\n\nFor their part, the Shut It Down Six rejected community service, arguing that trying to shut down Vermont Yankee was itself community service. At least some of them invited Judge Wesley to send them to jail. The judge refused.\n\nJustice on Nuclear Risk\n\nDuring the trial, as Dusty Miller wrote later: \u201cPaki Wieland asked Vernon police Chief Mary Beth Hebert if, after the many times she had been called to Vermont Yankee to arrest these aging activists, \u2018do you see us as unrepentant recidivists or persistent women?\u2019\n\n\u201cOfficer Hebert smiled warmly, answering in an unmistakably affectionate tone \u2018you are persistent!\u2019 As the women masterfully conducted their own defense, spectators in the court room heard from police officers \u2013 and even VY\u2019s head of security \u2013 that the protestors had been consistently respectful and non-violent. Here was another lesson in the patience and courage it takes to act from conscience.\u201d\n\nAlso during the trial, as the Brattleboro Reformer\u2019s Mike Faher reported, Brown had intervened on the women\u2019s behalf and \u201cpointed out that it was allowable for the women to ask each other questions as cross-examination. [Judge] Wesley agreed and praised Brown\u2019s ethics, and the courtroom audience erupted in applause.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Crowe, Kehler, and Nestel, the other defendants were Nancy First, 82, and Paki Wieland, 68, both of Northampton, and Ellen Graves of West Springfield. The Shut It Down Six have 30 days from the verdict to appeal.\n\nAs the judge thanked the jury for struggling with the case, he commented: \u201cThis has been a difficult trial with difficult issues of conscience\u201d \u2014 even if he hadn\u2019t allowed the Shut It Down Six to argue those issues conscientiously. The judge also commented that: \u201cThere are certain criminal behaviors for which the criminal justice system is a pretty crude instrument.\u201d\n\nFor all its relevance to serious, intractable public issues, substantive media coverage of this trial was largely limited to the Rutland Herald\u2019s Susan Smallheer and the Brattleboro Reformer\u2019s Mike Faher. A brief Associated Press report with little context or detail was picked up by news media around the country\n\nWhat the rest of the country learned was that the judge fined the women $350 each for trespassing. What the rest of the country did not learn was that the Shut It Down Six told a reporter they wouldn\u2019t pay the fine, and that the prosecutor said that if they didn\u2019t pay, the matter would be turned over to a collection agency.\n\nWilliam Boardman lives in Vermont, where he has produced political satire for public radio and served as a lay judge.", "domain": "consortiumnews.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://consortiumnews.com/2012/11/30/vermont-nuke-case-cites-risks/"}

Add your two cents.\n\nHeadline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!\n\nThen-President Barack Obama had stern words after the Republican minority in the Senate shut down the government for 16 days in 2013 over funding for Obamacare.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like a particular policy or a particular president? Then argue for your position. Go out there and win an election. Push to change it. But don\u2019t break it,\u201d Obama said in remarks Oct. 17, 2013, after Congress reached a deal to reopen the government. \u201cDon\u2019t break what our predecessors spent over two centuries building. That\u2019s not being faithful to what this country\u2019s about.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, there\u2019s been a lot of discussion lately of the politics of this shutdown,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut let\u2019s be clear. There are no winners here. These last few weeks have inflicted completely unnecessary damage on our economy.\u201d\n\nThe government shut down again early Saturday after the Senate failed to pass a temporary funding bill. Democrats voted against the measure and demanded a deal to address illegal immigrants who have protection under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\n\nBoth parties have spent the past week fighting over who is more responsible for the shutdown. Republicans blame Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer for fighting for illegal immigrants more than the military service members and government employees who would be affected by the shutdown.\n\n\u201cSenate Democrats own the Schumer Shutdown. Tonight, they put politics above our national security, military families, vulnerable children, and our country\u2019s ability to serve all Americans,\u201d White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement Saturday. \u201cWe will not negotiate the status of unlawful immigrants while Democrats hold our lawful citizens hostage over their reckless demands. This is the behavior of obstructionist losers, not legislators.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, have placed the blame on Republicans who control the House, and the Senate by a narrow majority, and President Donald Trump for failing to negotiate, but neither side appears to be making specific policy demands.\n\nSchumer himself decried the politics of brinksmanship that led to the 2013 shutdown. \u201cNo matter how strongly one feels about an issue, you shouldn\u2019t hold millions of people hostage,\u201d Schumer said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d in 2013. \u201cThat\u2019s what the other side is doing. That\u2019s wrong, and we can\u2019t give in to that.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s 2013 charge that the GOP should \u201cgo out there and win an election\u201d if they didn\u2019t like his policies proved prophetic.

Add your two cents.\n\nHeadline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!\n\nStaged crime scene photo shows L-bracket screwed to a random door, not the actual stairwell door as investigators report.\n\nThe verdict is in. Photographic evidence shows that crime scene photos in the Mandalay Bay were staged to uphold the official narrative of a \u2018lone wolf shooter\u2019.\n\nUpdate: Intellihub reached out to Mandalay Bay building engineer Paulina on Sunday, who confirmed over the phone that all stairwell doors and jams in the building are, in fact, metallic and are indeed 3-hour fire rated, per code (i.e. the photograph of the wooden door in \u201cPicture 1\u201d which was released in the LVMPD report is staged. The door which leads into the stairwell has been confirmed to be metal by MGM staff and not wooden, more over the hardware and paint are different colors.) Even if the door shown in \u201cPicture 1\u201d was an inner stairwell door, like the report claims, that door would have to be made metal and not wood \u2014 and it is \u2014 this has been confirmed. The inner door is metal.\n\n\n\nLAS VEGAS (INTELLIHUB) \u2014 The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and F.B.I. have some explaining to do after Intellihub discovered that the L-bracket shown in crime scene \u201cPicture 1\u201d on page 54 of the Jan. 19, 2018, preliminary investigative report for the 1 Oct. mass casualty shooting was not screwed to the inner stairwell door outside of room 32-135, as reported by investigators but rather it was screwed to an unknown random door which suggests that the photograph was staged.\n\nThis fact can easily be proven.\n\nFirst we will examine \u201cPicture 1\u201d from the LVMPD\u2019s report, Appendix A, page 54.\n\nIt is clear that the door is wooden and is painted white. The door has a gold handle. You can clearly see an L-bracket was screwed to the door about 12-14 inches above the gold handle.\n\nNow, we will examine a picture of the outside stairwell door (pictured to the left).\n\nJust through the door on the left (pictured above) there is another door inside the stairwell foyer which leads to the stairs.\n\nHere is a diagram to make it clear.\n\nThe inner stairwell door does have gold hardware but is made of metal and not wood like \u201cPicture 1\u201d implies.\n\nOkay, so I know what you are thinking \u2014 maybe the L-bracket was screwed to the other side of the door, inside of the stairwell, right?\n\nWrong. Video footage captured by Crowdsource the Truth\u2019s Jason Goodman reveals that the stairwell door leading to the 32nd-floor hallway, just outside of room 32-135 can not be the door in \u201cPicture 1.\u201d\n\nTake a close look at the screenshot. You can see that this is a metal door (\u201cPicture 1\u201d is a wooden one.)\n\nThe door pictured above is simply not the door which authorities are claiming was screwed shut with an L-Bracket. The door above, the actual door, is a metal door.\n\nIn \u201cPicture 13,\u201d also released in the LVMPD report, we can clearly see that all of the door hardware on the 32nd-floor does, in fact, have a brushed nickel finish, not gold. This hardware is consistent with all of the hardware on the 32nd-floor which lets us know it is the inner stairwell door which raises the red flag.\n\nIt is also important to reiterate that the door shown in \u201cPicture 1\u201d is wooden. This is absolute proof that the door shown in \u201cPicture 1\u201d is not the real stairwell door because all stairwell doors must be made of metal and be fire-rated per Clark County and National Building Code. This is a fact, fire-rated doors have to be used.\n\nAccording to TruDoor, a fire rated door manufacturer:\n\nFire-Rated steel doors play a vital role in keeping people safe and minimizing property damage during a fire. Labeled fire doors control the spread of fire and smoke for up to 3 hours. Metal fire doors are an economical alternative to wood fire doors, when more than a 20 minute rating is required. Steel is the sole door material to deliver a 3 hour fire-rating.\n\nNow what?\n\nThe LVMPD and F.B.I. have now clearly been caught staging the crime scene photos.\n\nNeither the 33rd nor the 27th floor interior stairwell doors have outward facing molding.\n\nIn addition, the out of place \u201cwood\u201d artifacts from the torn screws of L bracket in official crime scene photo & door-jambs do not match known examples from @MandalayBay #LasVegasShooting pic.twitter.com/eBXQs00vnQ \u2014 GHOSTCRAB (@JIBCAMERA) January 22, 2018\n\n#DemandAnswers.\n\n#LasVegasShooting.\n\n*This article was last updated at 8:00 p.m., EST, on Jan. 21, 2018.\n\nShepard Ambellas is an opinion journalist, analyst, and the founder and editor-in-chief of Intellihub News & Politics (Intellihub.com).

Downing Street in London has said that it expects an official announcement to be made soon.\n\nWelby, 56, an Old Etonian and former businessman in the oil industry, is expected to be announced on Thursday as the successor to Dr Rowan Williams, who will step down at the end of the year.\n\nThe Bishop of Durham was previously touted as one of the favorites to take the position,having performed well during the interview stages of the selection process. However, his relatively short career in the clergy had been seen as a potential barrier to his appointment.\n\nWelby is known to support the biblical definition of marriage as between one man and one woman; he is against same sex marriage and is opposed to homosexuals serving as bishops. Theologically he has been described by The Telegraph UK as \"unashamedly part of the evangelical tradition, upholding a more traditional and conservative interpretation of the Bible than some in the Church of England.\"\n\nThe selection process for the 105th clergyman to sit on the thrown of St Augustine has been a drawn out and slow process, dragging on for months. It is believed that the process has been mired in internal politics.\n\nEven now, with the unofficial news of his selection being made public, neither the Church of England nor Lambeth Palace have stepped forward yet to confirm the appointment. In addition the spokesperson for the Crown Nominations Commission (CNC), the body given the task of finding William's successor, has refused to comment on the reports that Welby has been selected and has officially accepted the job.\n\nHowever, the British prime minister's official spokesperson has confirmed on Wednesday that Downing Street was expecting an announcement to be made imminently.\n\nThe CNC has met an unprecedented four times until now to make a decision. However, Welby's name is now finally reported to have been passed to Downing Street as the chosen candidate of the 16 member selection commission.\n\nWelby's mother was in fact a private secretary to British war time Prime Minister Winston Churchill. The Bishop of Durham is also a graduate of the prestigious Cambridge University in England, and spent his young work life employed in the oil industry. He has worked for French oil company Elf Aquitaine as well as for Enterprise Oil plc. It was not until the 1990s that Welby embarked on his career in the Church.\n\nHe became the Dean of Liverpool in 2007, and was only appointed as the Bishop of Durham less than 13 months ago in November 2011. The core weakness in his application for the position as the Archbishop of Canterbury was thought to be inexperience. Other candidates up against him held far greater experience in the Church than him, but it now appears as though any fears surrounding his relatively short time in senior roles in the Church have been allayed.\n\nOther leading candidates considered for the position were the Bishop of Norwich, the Right Rev Graham James; the Bishop of Oxford, the Right Rev John Pritchard; the Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu; as well as the Bishop of Liverpool, the Right Rev James Jones. All have been notified of the CNC's decision, according to The Times of London.\n\nMeanwhile, the current Archbishop of Canterbury and spiritual head of the 77 million member worldwide Anglican Communion, Dr Rowan Williams, recently spoke at an Anglican Consultative Council meeting in Auckland. He quoted heralded theologian Karl Barth as he gave advice to whoever succeeds him:\n\n\"You have to be cross-referencing all the time and saying, 'How does the vision of humanity and community in the Bible map on to these issues of poverty, privation, violence and conflict?' And you have to use what you read in the newspaper to prompt and direct the questions that you put to the Bible: 'Where is this going to help me?' So I think somebody who likes reading the Bible and likes reading newspapers would be a good start.\"\n\nAn official announcement is expected on Thursday or within the next 48 hours at the latest.\n\nA number of Bishop Justin Welby's recent sermons can be found by clicking here.\n\nBelow is a video detailing Welby's appointment last year as the Bishop of Durham and gives insight into who he is and his beliefs.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/justin-welby-to-be-named-new-archbishop-of-canterbury-described-as-unashamedly-evangelical-84610/"}

Obama again is put in a tight spot, but other U.S. presidents faced similar challenges, as Morgan Strong reported in 2010.\n\nBy Morgan Strong (Originally published May 31, 2010)\n\nAt the end of a news conference on April 13, 2010, President Barack Obama made the seemingly obvious point that the continuing Middle East conflict pitting Israel against its Arab neighbors will end up \u201ccosting us significantly in terms of both blood and treasure.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s remark followed a similar statement in congressional testimony by Gen. David Petraeus on March 16, linking the unresolved Israeli-Palestinian conflict to the challenges that U.S. troops face in the region.\n\n\u201cThe conflict foments anti-American sentiment, due to a perception of U.S. favoritism for Israel,\u201d Petraeus said in prepared testimony. \u201cArab anger over the Palestinian question limits the strength and depth of U.S. partnerships with governments and peoples in the [region] and weakens the legitimacy of moderate regimes in the Arab world. Meanwhile, al-Qaeda and other militant groups exploit that anger to mobilize support.\u201d\n\n[Petraeus later tried to back away from this implicit criticism of Israel, fearing that it would hurt his political standing with his neoconservative allies. He began insisting that the analysis was only part of his written testimony, not his oral remarks.]\n\nYet, the truth behind the assessments from Obama and Petraeus is self-evident to anyone who has spent time observing the Middle East for the past six decades. Even the staunchly pro-Israeli Bush administration made similar observations.\n\nIn 2007 in Jerusalem, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice termed the Israeli/Palestinian peace process of \u201cstrategic interest\u201d to the United States and expressed empathy for the beleaguered Palestinian people. \u201cThe prolonged experience of deprivation and humiliation can radicalize even normal people,\u201d Rice said, referring to acts of Palestinian violence.\n\nBut the recent statement by Obama and Petraeus aroused alarm among some Israeli supporters who reject any suggestion that Israel\u2019s harsh treatment of Palestinians might be a factor in the anti-Americanism surging through the Islamic world.\n\nAfter Petraeus\u2019s comment, the pro-Israeli Anti-Defamation League said linking the Palestinian plight and Muslim anger was \u201cdangerous and counterproductive.\u201d\n\n\u201cGen. Petraeus has simply erred in linking the challenges faced by the U.S. and coalition forces in the region to a solution of the Israeli-Arab conflict, and blaming extremist activities on the absence of peace and the perceived U.S. favoritism for Israel,\u201d ADL national director Abraham Foxman said.\n\nHowever, the U.S. government\u2019s widespread (though often unstated) recognition of the truth behind the assessment in Petraeus\u2019s testimony has colored how the Obama administration has reacted to the intransigence of Israel\u2019s Likud government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nThe U.S. government realizes how much it has done on Israel\u2019s behalf, even to the extent of making Americans the targets of Islamic terrorism such as the 9/11 attacks (as the 9/11 Commission discovered but played down) and sacrificing the lives of thousands of U.S. troops fighting in Middle East conflicts.\n\nThat was the backdrop in March 2009 for President Obama\u2019s outrage over the decision of the Netanyahu government to continue building Jewish housing in Arab East Jerusalem despite the fact that the move complicated U.S. peace initiatives and was announced as Vice President Joe Biden arrived to reaffirm American support for Israel.\n\nHowever, another little-acknowledged truth about the U.S.-Israeli relationship is that Israeli leaders have frequently manipulated and misled American presidents out of a confidence that U.S. politicians deeply fear the political fallout from any public battle with Israel.\n\nGiven that history, few analysts who have followed the arc of U.S.-Israeli relations since Israel\u2019s founding in 1948 believe that the Israeli government is likely to retreat very much in its confrontation with President Obama.\n\nManipulating Eisenhower\n\nIn the 1950s, President Dwight Eisenhower was a strong supporter of the fledgling Jewish state and had supplied Israel with advanced U.S. weaponry. Yet, despite Eisenhower\u2019s generosity and good intentions, Israel sided with the British and French in 1956 in a conspiracy against him.\n\nIsraeli leaders joined a secret arrangement that involved Israel invading Egypt\u2019s Sinai, which then allowed France and Great Britain to introduce their own forces and reclaim control of the Suez Canal.\n\nIn reaction to the invasion, the Soviet Union threatened to intervene on the side of Egypt by sending ground troops. With Cold War tensions already stretched thin by the crises in Hungary and elsewhere, Eisenhower faced the possibility of a showdown between nuclear-armed adversaries. Eisenhower demanded that the Israeli-spearheaded invasion of the Sinai be stopped, and he brought financial and political pressures to bear on Great Britain and France.\n\nA ceasefire soon was declared, and the British and French departed, but the Israelis dragged their heels. Eisenhower finally presented Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion with an ultimatum, a threat to cut off all U.S. aid. Finally, in March 1957, the Israelis withdrew. [For details, see Eisenhower and Israel by Isaac Alteras]\n\nEven as it backed down in the Sinai, Israel was involved in another monumental deception, a plan for building its own nuclear arsenal.\n\nIn 1956, Israel had concluded an agreement with France to build a nuclear reactor in the Negev desert. Israel also signed a secret agreement with France to build an adjacent plutonium reprocessing plant.\n\nIsrael began constructing its nuclear plant in 1958. However, French President Charles de Gaulle was worried about nuclear weapons destabilizing the Middle East and insisted that Israel not develop a nuclear bomb from the plutonium processing plant. Prime Minister Ben-Gurion assured de Gaulle that the processing plant was for peaceful purposes only.\n\nAfter John F. Kennedy became President, he also wrote to Ben-Gurion explicitly calling on Israel not to join the nuclear-weapons club, drawing another pledge from Ben-Gurion that Israel had no such intention.\n\nNevertheless, Kennedy continued to press, forcing the Israelis to let U.S. scientists inspect the nuclear reactor at Dimona. But the Israelis first built a fake control room while bricking up and otherwise disguising parts of the building that housed the plutonium processing plant.\n\nIn return for allowing inspectors into Dimona, Ben-Gurion also demanded that the United States sell Hawk surface-to-air missiles to the Israeli military. Kennedy agreed to the sale as a show of good faith. Subsequently, however, the CIA got wind of the Dimona deception and leaked to the press that Israel was secretly building a nuclear bomb.\n\nAfter Kennedy\u2019s assassination, President Lyndon Johnson also grew concerned over Israel\u2019s acquiring nuclear weapons. He asked then-Prime Minister Levi Eshkol to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n\nEshkol assured Johnson that Israel was studying the matter and would sign the treaty in due course. However, Israel has never signed the treaty and never has admitted that it developed nuclear weapons. [For details, See Israel and The Bomb by Avner Cohen.]\n\nTrapping Johnson\n\nAs Israel grew more sophisticated and more confident in its dealings with U.S. presidents, it also sought to secure U.S. military assistance by exaggerating its vulnerability to Arab attacks.\n\nOne such case occurred after the Egyptians closed off the Gulf of Aqaba to Israel in May 1967, denying the country its only access to the Red Sea. Israel threatened military action against Egypt if it did not re-open the Gulf.\n\nIsrael then asked President Johnson for military assistance in the event war broke out against the Egyptians. Johnson directed Richard Helms, the newly appointed head of the CIA to evaluate Israel\u2019s military capability in the event of war against the surrounding Arab states.\n\nOn May 26, 1967, Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban met with Johnson, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, and Helms. Eban presented a Mossad estimate of the capability of the Arab armies, claiming that Israel was seriously outgunned by the Arab armies which had been supplied with advanced Soviet weaponry. Israel believed that, owing to its special relationship with the United States, the Mossad intelligence assessment would be taken at face value.\n\nHowever, Helms was asked to present the CIA estimate of the Arabs\u2019 military capabilities versus the Israeli army. The CIA\u2019s analysts concluded that Israel could \u201cdefend successfully against simultaneous Arab attacks on all fronts, or hold on any three fronts while mounting a successful major offensive on the fourth.\u201d [See \u201cC.I.A. Analysis of the 1967 Arab Israeli War,\u201d Center for the Study of Intelligence.]\n\n\u201cWe do not believe that the Israeli appreciation was a serious estimate of the sort they would submit to their own high officials,\u201d the CIA report said. \u201cIt is probably a gambit intended to influence the U.S. to provide military supplies, make more public commitments to Israel, to approve Israeli military initiatives, and put more pressure on Egyptian President Nasser.\u201d [See A Look Over My Shoulder by Richard Helms.]\n\nThe CIA report stated further that the Soviet Union would probably not interfere militarily on behalf of the Arab states and that Israel would defeat the combined Arab armies in a matter of days. As a consequence, Johnson refused to airlift special military supplies to Israel, or to promise public support for Israel if Israel went to war.\n\nThe Six-Day Success\n\nDespite Johnson\u2019s resistance, Israel launched an attack on its Arab neighbors on June 5, 1967, claiming that the conflict was provoked when Egyptian forces opened fire. (The CIA later concluded that it was Israel that had first fired upon Egyptian forces.)\n\nOn June 8, at the height of the conflict, which would become known as the Six-Day War, Israeli fighter/bombers attacked the USS Liberty, a lightly armed communications vessel sent on a mission to relay information on the course of the war to U.S. naval intelligence.\n\nThe attack killed 34 Americans sailors, and wounded 171 others. Israeli leaders have always claimed that they had mistaken the U.S. vessel for an enemy ship, but a number of U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Dean Rusk, believed the attack was deliberate, possibly to prevent the United States from learning about Israel\u2019s war plans. [See As I Saw It by Dean Rusk.]\n\nHowever, in deference to Israel, the U.S. government did not aggressively pursue the matter of the Liberty attack and even issued misleading accounts in medal citations to crew members, leaving out the identity of the attackers.\n\nMeanwhile, on land and in the air, Israel\u2019s powerful military advanced, shredding the Arab defenses. Soon, the conflict escalated into another potential showdown between nuclear-armed superpowers, the Soviet Union and the United States.\n\nOn June 10, President Johnson received a \u201cHot Line\u201d message from Soviet Premier Alexi Kosygin. The Kremlin warned of grave consequences if Israel continued its military campaign against Syria by entering and/or occupying that country.\n\nJohnson dispatched the Sixth Fleet to the Mediterranean, in a move to convince the Soviets of American resolve. But a ceasefire was declared later the same day, with Israel ending up in control of Syria\u2019s Golan Heights, Egypt\u2019s Sinai, and Palestinian lands including Gaza and East Jerusalem.\n\nBut a wider war was averted. Johnson\u2019s suspicions about Israel\u2019s expansionist intent had kept the United States from making an even bigger commitment that might have led to the Soviets countering with an escalation of their own.\n\nNixon and Yom Kippur\n\nIsraeli occupation of those additional Arab lands set the stage for a resumption of hostilities six years later, on Oct. 6, 1973, with the Yom Kippur War, which began with a surprise attack by Egypt against Israeli forces in the Sinai.\n\nThe offensive caught Israel off guard and Arab forces were close to overrunning Israel\u2019s outer defenses and entering the country. According to later accounts based primarily on Israeli leaks, Prime Minister Golda Meir and her \u201ckitchen cabinet\u201d ordered the arming of 13 nuclear weapons, which were aimed at Egyptian and Syrian targets.\n\nIsraeli Ambassador to the United States Simha Dintz warned President Richard Nixon that very serious repercussions would occur if the United States did not immediately begin an airlift of military equipment and personnel to Israel.\n\nFearing that the Soviet Union might intervene and that nuclear war was possible, the U.S. military raised its alert level to DEFCON-3. U.S. Airborne units in Italy were put on full alert, and military aid was rushed to Israel.\n\nFaced with a well-supplied Israeli counteroffensive and possible nuclear annihilation, the Arab forces fell back. The war ended on Oct. 26, 1973, but the United States had again been pushed to the brink of a possible superpower confrontation due to the unresolved Israeli-Arab conflict.\n\nNuclear \u2018Ambiguity\u2019\n\nOn Sept. 22, 1979, after some clouds unexpectedly broke over the South Indian Ocean, a U.S. intelligence satellite detected two bright flashes of light that were quickly interpreted as evidence of a nuclear test.\n\nThe explosion was apparently one of several nuclear tests that Israel had undertaken in collaboration with the white-supremacist government of South Africa. But President Jimmy Carter at the start of his reelection bid didn\u2019t want a showdown with Israel, especially on a point as sensitive as its secret nuclear work with the pariah government in Pretoria.\n\nSo, after news of the nuclear test leaked a month later, the Carter administration followed Israel\u2019s longstanding policy of \u201cambiguity\u201d about the existence of its nuclear arsenal, a charade dating back to Richard Nixon\u2019s presidency with the United States pretending not to know for sure that Israel possessed nuclear bombs.\n\nThe Carter administration quickly claimed that there was \u201cno confirmation\u201d of a nuclear test, and a panel was set up to conclude that the flashes were \u201cprobably not from a nuclear explosion.\u201d\n\nHowever, as investigative reporter Seymour Hersh and various nuclear experts later concluded, the flashes were most certainly an explosion of a low-yield nuclear weapon. [For details, see Hersh\u2019s Samson Option.]\n\nGetting Carter\n\nDespite Carter\u2019s helpful cover-up of the Israeli-South African nuclear test, he was still viewed with disdain by Israel\u2019s hard-line Likud leadership. Indeed, he arguably was the target of Israel\u2019s most audacious intervention in U.S. politics.\n\nPrime Minister Menachem Begin was furious at Carter over the 1978 Camp David accords in which the U.S. President pushed the Israelis into returning the Sinai to the Egyptians in exchange for a peace agreement.\n\nThe next year, Carter failed to protect the Shah of Iran, an important Israeli regional ally who was forced from power by Islamic militants. Then, when Carter acceded to demands from the Shah\u2019s supporters to admit him to New York for cancer treatment, Iranian radicals seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage.\n\nIn 1980, as Carter focused on his reelection campaign, Begin saw both dangers and opportunities. High-ranking Israeli diplomat/spy David Kimche described Begin\u2019s thinking in the 1991 book, The Last Option, recounting how Begin feared that Carter might force Israel to withdraw from the West Bank and accept a Palestinian state if he won a second term.\n\n\u201cBegin was being set up for diplomatic slaughter by the master butchers in Washington,\u201d Kimche wrote. \u201cThey had, moreover, the apparent blessing of the two presidents, Carter and [Egyptian President Anwar] Sadat, for this bizarre and clumsy attempt at collusion designed to force Israel to abandon her refusal to withdraw from territories occupied in 1967, including Jerusalem, and to agree to the establishment of a Palestinian state.\u201d\n\nBegin\u2019s alarm was driven by the prospect of Carter being freed from the pressure of having to face another election, according to Kimche.\n\n\u201cUnbeknownst to the Israeli negotiators, the Egyptians held an ace up their sleeves, and they were waiting to play it,\u201d Kimche wrote. \u201cThe card was President Carter\u2019s tacit agreement that after the American presidential elections in November 1980, when Carter expected to be re-elected for a second term, he would be free to compel Israel to accept a settlement of the Palestinian problem on his and Egyptian terms, without having to fear the backlash of the American Jewish lobby.\u201d\n\nSo, by spring 1980, Begin had privately sided with Carter\u2019s Republican rival, Ronald Reagan, a reality that Carter soon realized.\n\nQuestioned by congressional investigators in 1992 regarding allegations about Israel conspiring with Republicans in 1980 to help unseat him, Carter said he knew by April 1980 that \u201cIsrael cast their lot with Reagan,\u201d according to notes found among the unpublished documents in the files of a House task force that looked into the so-called October Surprise case.\n\nCarter traced the Israeli opposition to his reelection to a \u201clingering concern [among] Jewish leaders that I was too friendly with Arabs.\u201d\n\nDoing What Was Necessary\n\nBegin was an Israeli leader committed to do whatever he felt necessary to advance Israeli security interests and the dream of a Greater Israel with Jews controlling the ancient Biblical lands. Before Israel\u2019s independence in 1948, he had led a Zionist terrorist group, and he founded the right-wing Likud Party in 1973 with the goal of \u201cchanging the facts on the ground\u201d by placing Jewish settlements in Palestinian areas.\n\nBegin\u2019s anger over the Sinai deal and his fear of Carter\u2019s reelection set the stage for secret collaboration between Begin and the Republicans, according to another former Israeli intelligence official, Ari Ben-Menashe.\n\n\u201cBegin loathed Carter for the peace agreement forced upon him at Camp David,\u201d Ben-Menashe wrote in his 1992 memoir, Profits of War. \u201cAs Begin saw it, the agreement took away Sinai from Israel, did not create a comprehensive peace, and left the Palestinian issue hanging on Israel\u2019s back.\u201d\n\nBen-Menashe, an Iranian-born Jew who had immigrated to Israel as a teen-ager, became part of a secret Israeli program to reestablish its Iranian intelligence network that had been decimated by the Islamic revolution. Ben-Menashe wrote that Begin authorized shipments to Iran of small arms and some military spare parts, via South Africa, as early as September 1979 and continued them despite Iran\u2019s seizure of the U.S. hostages in November 1979.\n\nExtensive evidence also exists that Begin\u2019s preference for Reagan led the Israelis to join in a covert operation with Republicans to contact Iranian leaders behind Carter\u2019s back, interfering with the President\u2019s efforts to free the 52 American hostages before the November 1980 elections.\n\nThat evidence includes statements from senior Iranian officials, international arms dealers, intelligence operatives (including Ben-Menashe), and Middle East political figures (including a cryptic confirmation from Begin\u2019s successor Yitzhak Shamir). But the truth about the October Surprise case remains in dispute to this day. [For details, see Robert Parry\u2019s America\u2019s Stolen Narrative and Secrecy & Privilege.]\n\nIt is clear that after Reagan defeated Carter \u2014 and the U.S. hostages were released immediately upon Reagan being sworn in on Jan. 20, 1981 \u2014 Israeli-brokered weapons shipments flowed to Iran with the secret blessing of the new Republican administration.\n\nDealing with Reagan\n\nThe Israel Lobby had grown exponentially since its start in the Eisenhower years. Israel\u2019s influential supporters were now positioned to use every political device imaginable to lobby Congress and to get the White House to acquiesce to whatever Israel felt it needed.\n\nPresident Reagan also credentialed into the Executive Branch a new group of pro-Israeli American officials the likes of Elliott Abrams, Richard Perle, Michael Ledeen and Jeane Kirkpatrick who became known as the neocons.\n\nYet, despite Reagan\u2019s pro-Israel policies, the new U.S. President wasn\u2019t immune from more Israeli deceptions and additional pressures. Indeed, whether because of the alleged collusion with Reagan during the 1980 campaign or because Israel sensed its greater clout within his administration, Begin demonstrated a new level of audacity.\n\nIn 1981, Israel recruited Jonathan Pollard, an American Navy intelligence analyst, as a spy to acquire American intelligence satellite photos. Eventually, Pollard purloined massive amounts of intelligence information, some of which was reportedly turned over to Soviet intelligence by Israel to win favors from Moscow.\n\nPrime Minister Begin sensed, too, that the time was ripe to gain the upper hand on other Arab enemies. He turned his attention to Lebanon, where the Palestine Liberation Organization was based.\n\nWhen U.S. intelligence warned Reagan that Israel was massing troops along the border with Lebanon, Reagan sent a cable to Begin urging him not to invade. But Begin ignored Reagan\u2019s plea and invaded Lebanon the following day, on June 6, 1982. [See Time, Aug. 16, 1982.]\n\nAs the offensive progressed, Reagan sought a cessation of hostilities between Israel and the PLO, but Israel was intent on killing as many PLO fighters as possible. Periodic U.S.-brokered ceasefires failed as Israel used the slightest provocation to resume fighting, supposedly in self-defense.\n\n\u201cWhen PLO sniper fire is followed by fourteen hours of Israeli bombardment that is stretching the definition of defensive action too far,\u201d complained Reagan, who kept the picture of a horribly burned Lebanese child on his desk in the Oval Office as a reminder of the tragedy of Lebanon.\n\nThe American public nightly witnessed the Israeli bombardment of Beirut on television news broadcasts. The pictures of dead, mutilated children caught in the Israeli artillery barrages, were particularly wrenching. Repulsed by the carnage, the U.S. public decidedly favored forcing Israel to stop.\n\nWhen Reagan warned Israel of possible sanctions if its forces continued to indiscriminately attack Beirut, Israel launched a major offensive against West Beirut the next day.\n\nIn the United States, Israeli supporters demanded a meeting with Reagan to press Israel\u2019s case. Though Reagan declined the meeting, one was set up for 40 leaders of various Jewish organizations with Vice President George H.W. Bush, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Secretary of State George Shultz.\n\nReagan wrote once again to Begin, reminding him that Israel was allowed to use American weapons only for defensive purposes. He appealed to Begin\u2019s humanitarianism to stop the bombardment.\n\nThe next day, in a meeting with Israeli supporters from the United States, Begin fumed that he would not be instructed by an American president or any other U.S. official. \u201cNobody is going to bring Israel to her knees. You must have forgotten that Jews do not kneel but to God,\u201d Begin said. \u201cNobody is going to preach to us humanitarianism.\u201d\n\nMore Tragedy\n\nBegin\u2019s government also used the tragedy in Lebanon as an opportunity to provide special favors for its American backers.\n\nIn From Beirut to Jerusalem, New York Times correspondent Thomas L. Freidman wrote that the Israeli Army conducted tours of the battlefront for influential U.S. donors. On one occasion, women from Hadassah were taken to the hills surrounding Beirut and were invited to look down on the city as Israeli artillery put on a display for them.\n\nThe artillery began an enormous barrage, with shells landing throughout the densely populated city. The shells struck and destroyed apartments, shops, homes and shacks in the squalid refugee camps of the Palestinians.\n\nA ceasefire was finally agreed upon by Israel and the PLO, requiring Yasser Arafat and all PLO fighters to leave Lebanon. The Palestinians were assured, as part of the agreement brokered by the United States, that their wives and children living in Lebanese refugee camps would be safe from harm. The PLO then left Lebanon by ship in August 1982, moving the PLO headquarters to Tunisia.\n\nOn Sept. 16, Israel\u2019s Christian militia allies, with Israeli military support, entered the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps, and conducted a three-day campaign of rape and murder. Most of the dead with estimates varying from Israel\u2019s count of 400 to a Palestinian estimate of nearly 1,000 were women and children.\n\nAmerican Marines, who had been dispatched to Lebanon as peacekeepers to oversee the PLO evacuation but then had departed, hastily returned after the Sabra and Shatila massacres. They were housed in a large warehouse complex near Beirut\u2019s airport.\n\nOver the next year, American forces found themselves drawn into the worsening Lebanese civil war. A key moment occurred on Sept. 18, 1983, when Reagan\u2019s national security adviser Robert McFarlane, who was considered a staunch supporter of Israel, ordered U.S. warships to bombard Muslim targets inside Lebanon.\n\nAs Gen. Colin Powell, then a top aide to Defense Secretary Weinberger, wrote in his memoir, \u201cWhen the shells started falling on the Shiites, they assumed the American \u2018referee\u2019 had taken sides.\u201d [See Powell\u2019s My American Journey.]\n\nMuslim attacks on the Marines in Beirut soon escalated. On Oct. 23, 1983, two Shiite Muslims drove explosives-laden trucks into two buildings in Beirut, one housing French forces and the other the Marines. The blasts killed 241 Americans and 58 French.\n\nOver the ensuing weeks, American forces continued to suffer losses in skirmishes with Muslim militiamen near the Beirut airport and American civilians also became targets for execution and hostage-taking.\n\nOn Feb. 7, 1984, Reagan announced that the Marines would be redeployed from Lebanon. Within a couple of weeks, the last of the Marines had departed Lebanon, having suffered a total of 268 killed.\n\nHowever, the hostage-taking of Americans continued, ironically creating an opportunity for Israel to intercede again through its contacts in Iran to seek the help of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini\u2019s regime in getting the Lebanese Shiite militants to release captured Americans.\n\nIsraeli arms dealers and neocon Americans, such as Michael Ledeen, were used as middlemen for the secret arms-for-hostages deals, which Reagan approved and McFarlane oversaw. However, the arms deliveries via Israel failed to reduce the overall number of Americans held hostage in Lebanon and were eventually exposed in November 1986, becoming Reagan\u2019s worst scandal, the Iran-Contra Affair.\n\nNoriega and Harari\n\nThough Israel\u2019s government had created some headaches for Reagan, it also provided some help, allowing its arms dealers and intelligence operatives to assist some of Reagan\u2019s favorite covert operations, particularly in Central America where the U.S. Congress had objected to military assistance going to human rights violators, like the Guatemalan military, and to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.\n\nAs Vice President, George H.W. Bush met with Panamanian dictator Manuel Noreiga and considered him a compliant partner. Noriega subsequently funneled financial and other help to Reagan\u2019s beloved Contras and once even volunteered to arrange the assassinations of leaders of the Sandinista government in Nicaragua.\n\nOne of Noriega\u2019s top operatives was Michael Harari, who had led Israeli assassination teams and who had served as the Israeli Mossad station chief in Mexico. In Panama, Harari became a key intermediary for Israeli contributions to the Contras, supplying them with arms and training, while Noriega handed over cash.\n\nBut Noriega and Harari were conducting other business in the region, allegedly working as middlemen and money launderers for the lucrative smuggling of cocaine into the United States. When that information surfaced in the U.S. news media and Noriega became notorious as an unstable thug George H.W. Bush as President found himself under enormous political pressure in 1989 to remove Noriega from power.\n\nSo, Bush prepared to invade Panama in December 1989. However, the Israeli government was concerned about the possible capture of Harari, whom U.S. prosecutors regarded as Noriega\u2019s top co-conspirator but who also was someone possessing sensitive information about Israeli clandestine activities.\n\nSix hours before U.S. troops were to invade Panama, Harari was warned of the impending attack, an alert that enabled him to flee and may have compromised the safety of American paratroopers and Special Forces units preparing to begin the assault, units that took surprisingly heavy casualties.\n\nTipped off by Israeli intelligence agents, Harari was whisked away by an Israeli embassy car, flying a diplomatic flag, with diplomatic license plates to ensure he would not be stopped and held, according to an interview that I had in January 1990 with Col. Edward Herrera Hassen, commander of Panama Defense Forces.\n\nHarari soon was on his way back to Israel, where the government has since rebuffed U.S. requests that Harari be extradited to the United States to stand trial in connection with the Noriega case. For his part, Noriega was captured and brought to the United States where he was convicted of eight drug and racketeering charges.\n\nThe Lobby\n\nThe one constant in Israel\u2019s endless maneuverings both with and against the U.S. government has been the effectiveness of the Israel Lobby and its many allies to fend off sustained criticism of Israel, sometimes by smearing critics as anti-Semitic or by mounting aggressive cover-ups when investigations threatened to expose ugly secrets.\n\nGiven this long record of success, U.S. presidents and other politicians have demonstrated a declining capacity to press Israel into making concessions, the way Eisenhower, Kennedy and Carter tried to do.\n\nFor instance, when President Bill Clinton first met with Netanyahu in 1996, Clinton was surprised to find himself getting a lecture from Israel\u2019s Likud prime minister. \u201cWho the f**k does he think he is? Who\u2019s the superpower here?\u201d a peeved Clinton was quoted as saying. [See The Much Too Promised Land, by Aaron Miller, an aide to Clinton.]\n\nJoe Lockhart, then White House spokesman, told Clayton Swisher, author of The Truth About Camp David, that Netanyahu was \u201cone of the most obnoxious individuals you\u2019re going to come into \u2013 just a liar and a cheat. He could open his mouth and you could have no confidence that anything that came out of it was the truth.\u201d\n\nFaced with these difficulties and fending off Republican attempts to drive him from office Clinton put off any serious push for a Middle East peace accord until the last part of his presidency.\n\nClinton negotiated the Wye River memorandum with Netanyahu and Arafat on Sept. 23, 1999, calling for reciprocal undertakings by both sides. The agreement called for the freezing of Israeli settlements on Palestinian land, but Netanyahu failed to stop the settlement activity. Demolition of Palestinian homes, restrictions on movement by Palestinians, and settlement building continued.\n\nUltimately, Clinton failed to achieve any breakthrough as his final efforts collapsed amid finger-pointing and distrust between the Palestinians and the Israelis.\n\nHandling Bush\n\nIsrael\u2019s hopes were buoyed further when George W. Bush entered the White House in 2001. Unlike his father who looked on the Israelis with suspicion and felt some kinship with the Arab oil states, the younger Bush was unabashedly pro-Israel.\n\nThough Reagan had credentialed many young neocons in the 1980s, he had kept them mostly away from Middle East policy, which usually fell to less ideological operatives such as Philip Habib and James Baker. However, George W. Bush installed the neocons in key jobs for Mideast policy, with the likes of Elliott Abrams at the National Security Council, Paul Wolfowitz and Douglas Feith at the Pentagon, and Lewis Libby inside Vice President Dick Cheney\u2019s office.\n\nThe neocons arrived with a plan to transform the Middle East based on a scheme prepared by a group of American neocons, including Perle and Feith, for Netanyahu in 1996. Called \u201cA Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm,\u201d the idea was to bring to heel all the antagonistic states confronting Israel.\n\nThe \u201cclean break\u201d was to abandon the idea of achieving peace in the region through mutual understanding and compromise. Instead, there would be \u201cpeace through strength,\u201d including violent removal of leaders who were viewed as hostile to Israel\u2019s interests.\n\nThe plan sought the ouster of Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime in Iraq, which was called \u201can important Israeli strategic objective in its own right.\u201d After Hussein\u2019s ouster, the plan envisioned destabilizing the Assad dynasty in Syria with hopes of replacing it with regime more favorable to Israel. That, in turn, would push Lebanon into Israel\u2019s arms and contribute to the destruction of Hezbollah, Israel\u2019s tenacious foe in South Lebanon.\n\nThe removal of Hezbollah in Lebanon would, in turn, weaken Iran\u2019s influence, both in Lebanon and in the occupied territories of Gaza and the West Bank, where Hamas and other Palestinian militants would find themselves cornered.\n\nBut what the \u201cclean break\u201d needed was the military might of the United States, since some of the targets like Iraq were too far away and too powerful to be overwhelmed even by Israel\u2019s highly efficient military. The cost in Israeli lives and to Israel\u2019s economy from such overreach would have been staggering.\n\nThe only way to implement the strategy was to enlist a U.S. president, his administration and the Congress to join Israel in this audacious undertaking. That opportunity presented itself when Bush ascended to the White House and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, created a receptive political climate in the United States.\n\nTurning to Iraq\n\nAfter a quick strike against al-Qaeda and its allies in Afghanistan, the Bush administration turned its attention to conquering Iraq. However, even after the 9/11 attacks, the neocons and President Bush had to come up with rationales that were sellable to the American people, while playing down any suggestion that the coming conflicts were partially designed to advance Israel\u2019s interests.\n\nSo, the Bush administration put together tales about Iraqi stockpiles of WMD, its \u201creconstituted\u201d nuclear weapons program, and its alleged ties to al-Qaeda and other terrorists determined to strike at the United States. The PR operation worked like a charm. Bush rallied Congress and much of the American public behind an unprovoked invasion of Iraq, which began on March 19, 2003, and drove Saddam Hussein\u2019s government from power three weeks later.\n\nAt the time, the joke circulating among neocons was where to go next, Syria or Iran, with the punch line: \u201cReal men go to Tehran!\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Israel continued collecting as much intelligence as possible from the United States about the next desired target, Iran. On Aug. 27, 2004, CBS News broke a story about an FBI investigation into a possible spy working for Israel as a policy analyst for Under Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz. The official was identified as Lawrence Franklin.\n\nFranklin pled guilty to passing classified a Presidential Directive and other sensitive documents pertaining to U.S. foreign policy regarding Iran to the powerful Israeli lobbying group, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which shared the information with Israel.\n\nAccording to FBI surveillance tapes, Franklin relayed top secret information to Steve Rosen, AIPAC\u2019s policy director, and Keith Weissman, a senior policy analyst with AIPAC. On Aug. 30, 2004, Israeli officials admitted that Franklin had met repeatedly with Naor Gilon, head of the political department at the Israeli Embassy in Washington, and a specialist on Iran\u2019s nuclear programs.\n\nFranklin was sentenced to 12 years and seven months in prison for passing classified information to a pro-Israel lobby group and an Israeli diplomat. No charges were brought against the AIPAC executives or the Israeli diplomat.\n\nBloody Chaos\n\nMeanwhile, back in the Middle East, it turned out that occupying Iraq was more difficult than the Bush administration had anticipated. Ultimately, more than 4,400 American soldiers died in the conflict along with hundreds of thousands of Iraqis.\n\nThe bloody chaos in Iraq also meant that the neocon \u201creal men\u201d couldn\u2019t go either to Syria or Iran, at least not right away. They were forced into a waiting game, counting on the short memories of the American people before revving up the fear machine again to justify moving to the next phase.\n\nWhen the U.S. death toll finally began to decline in Iraq, the neocons stepped up their alarms about Iran becoming a danger to the world by developing nuclear weapons (although Iran has disavowed any desire to have nukes and U.S. intelligence expressed confidence in 2007 that Iran had stopped work on a warhead four years earlier).\n\nStill, while trying to keep the focus away from its own nuclear arsenal, Israel has pushed the international community to bring pressure on Iran, in part by threatening to mount its own military attack on Iran if the U.S. government and other leading powers don\u2019t act aggressively.\n\nThe neocon anti-Iran plans were complicated by the victory of Barack Obama, who promised to reach out in a more respectful way to the Muslim world. Inside Israel and in U.S. neocon circles, complaints quickly spread about Obama\u2019s coziness with Muslims (even claims that he was a secret Muslim or anti-Semitic).\n\nObama further antagonized the neocons and Israeli hardliners by suggesting a linkage between the festering Palestinian problem and dangers to U.S. national security, including violence against U.S. troops in the Middle East.\n\nNetanyahu, who again had assumed the post of prime minister, and the neocons wanted U.S. policy refocused on Iran, with little attention on Israel as it continued its longstanding policy of building more and more Jewish settlements on what was once Palestinian land.\n\nIn reaction to Netanyahu\u2019s unwillingness to curb those settlements and with the announcement of more housing units during Biden\u2019s visit Obama retaliated by subjecting Netanyahu to several slights, including refusing to have photographs taken of the two of them meeting at the White House.\n\nObama walked out of one meeting with Netanyahu after failing to get his written promise for a concession on halting further settlement construction. Obama went to dinner alone, a very pointed insult to Netanyahu. As Obama left the meeting, he said, \u201cLet me know if there is anything new,\u201d according to a member of Congress who was present.\n\nSecret Pacts\n\nFor his part, Netanyahu has claimed that secret agreements with the Bush administration allow for the continued building of settlements. However, Obama said on National Public Radio that he does not consider himself bound by secret oral agreements that may have been made by President Bush.\n\nInstead, Obama claims Israel is bound by the 2003 \u201cRoad Map\u201d agreement which prohibits building more settlements. \u201cI\u2019ve said clearly to the Israelis both privately and publically that a freeze on settlements, including natural growth, is part of these obligations,\u201d Obama said.\n\nStill, Obama has shied away from publicly challenging Israel on some of its most sensitive issues, such as its undeclared nuclear-weapons arsenal. Like presidents back to Nixon, Obama has participated in the charade of \u201cambiguity.\u201d Even as he demanded \u201ctransparency\u201d from other countries, Obama continued to dance around questions regarding whether Israel has nuclear weapons.\n\nNetanyahu and Israel surely have vulnerabilities. Without America\u2019s military, diplomatic and economic support, Israel could not exist in its present form. One-quarter of Israeli wage incomes are derived from American aid money, German reparations and various charities. Without that outside assistance, Israel\u2019s standard of living would sink dramatically.\n\nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, Israel receives $2.4 billion a year in U.S. government grants, military assistance, loan guarantees, and sundry other sources. The United States also pays Egypt another $2 billion to keep the peace with Israel. The combined assistance to both countries comprises nearly one half of all U.S. foreign aid assistance worldwide.\n\nIn a sense, Israel can\u2019t be blamed for standing up for itself, especially given the long history of brutality and oppression directed against Jews. However, Israeli leaders have used this tragic history to justify their own harsh treatment of others, especially the Palestinians, many of whom were rooted from their ancestral homes.\n\nOver the past six decades, Israeli leaders also have refined their strategies for taking advantage of their staunchest ally, the United States.\n\nToday, with many powerful friends inside the United States and with Obama facing intense political pressure over his domestic and national security policies the Israeli government has plenty of reasons to believe that it can out-fox and outlast the current U.S. president as it did many of his predecessors.\n\nMorgan Strong is a former professor of Middle Eastern history, and was an advisor to CBS News \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on the Middle East.

No one is as generous as He is. The gifts He gives us- the blessings, the new life, the breakthroughs and the forgiveness- are greater than any other gift anyone else gives to us.\n\nBut of all the gifts God has given, there is nothing greater than the gift that is Himself. In His love for us, He first gave us Jesus Christ as our means of redemption and second He gave us the Holy Spirit.\n\nStarting off in the walk of faith, the Holy Spirit actually scared me more than He excited me. I was intimidated by the idea of being overtaken by a spirit not of my own so I ran away from Baptism by fire. But when I experienced Him one fateful day, my life was never the same again.\n\nReceiving the Holy Spirit is not only possible, it is essential for Christ-centered living. We cannot live in and for God apart from the power, work and manifestation of the Holy Spirit in our lives. The Holy Spirit is God Himself tangibly working in our hearts, minds and sometimes in our bodies to experience God's grace here on earth as it is in heaven.\n\nIt's through the Person and Work of the Holy Spirit that God works in us to allow us to be regenerated, reconciled, empowered, guided and strengthened for the work God calls us to do. But how does the Holy Spirit work in our life? Understanding this is essential so that we know how to ask God to work in us and so that we will learn to discern and recognize the Holy Spirit's work in us. Here are just some of the roles the Holy Spirit has in our personal an corporate lives.\n\nCounselor\n\nThe Bible refers to the Holy Spirit by many names, but one of the most common names are counselor, comforter and advocate. In John 14:26, Jesus introduced the Holy Spirit saying, \"But the Helper (Comforter, Advocate, Intercessor\u2014Counselor, Strengthener, Standby), the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name...\"\n\nThe Holy Spirit guides us into truth and gives us wisdom to live our lives the way we should and cause us to love God and love others through our thoughts and actions.\n\nEnabler\n\nHave you ever felt like you couldn't physically or mentally do something but somehow you were able to do it anyway? It's likely that the Holy Spirit was working in you. God's Spirit has been known to enable men and women both in the Bible and even today to do things they would've never been able to do on their own.\n\nWhen Philippians 4:13 tells us that we can \"do all things through Christ,\" it's because Christ has bridged us with access to the Spirit who now works in us by giving us gifts, abilities and promptings that allow us to do greater things for Him.\n\nChange-maker\n\nThe Holy Spirit does not just transform our spiritual destination, but also transforms us here on earth as well. Acts 1:8 tells us, \"But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses...\"\n\nBeing a witness means so much more than just being enabled to speak in front of crowds. It also means being empowered to live lives that glorify God. The Holy Spirit is the one who changes our hearts and attitudes so that we can turn away from sin and turn to Christ.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/what-holy-spirit-do-how-holy-spirit-work-180869/print.html"}

He always speaks his mind. He says things establishment RINOs are afraid to say.\"\n\nOther Republican presidential hopefuls have weighed in on the recent Trump endorsement of Hillary, offering various opinions on the front-runners' actions.\n\nDr. Ben Carson explained in a soft spoken voice that he felt Trump and Hillary made for a \"good fruit salad\" that will never be able to launch a \"war on hummus.\" Before clarifying his remarks, he left to do some laundry.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz of Texas was unimpressed by the endorsement, so much so that he vowed in Dr. Seuss form to never endorse the Democratic hopeful.\n\n\"I will not endorse Hillary on a boat, I will not endorse Hillary on a moat. I will not endorse her in the air, I will not endorse her anywhere,\" added Cruz as he typed up a public email claiming that Marco Rubio has dropped out of the race.\n\nRegarding the Trump endorsement, the Clinton camp declined to provide comment, though a live mic caught Bill whispering to Hillary that \"everything is going according to plan.\"\n\nWARNING: THE ARTICLE ABOVE IS A WORK OF SATIRE.

Midlevel versions cost a bit more than twice as much.\n\nApple failed to ship its $349 HomePod speaker in 2017, as it initially planned, and said the device would go on sale in early 2018.\n\nApple aims to make a profit on the device itself and bolster sales of its $9.99 per month Apple Music subscription, analysts said. Apple's voice assistant Siri likely will focus on recommending new songs.\n\nAmazon and Google, meanwhile, are eager to give consumers a taste of their respective digital assistants, Alexa and Google Assistant, at impulse-buy prices, hoping to lock in customers and profit from later sales of goods and data about buying habits.\n\nThe Home Mini and Echo Dot do not match the sound quality of the HomePod, but consumers may see less need for a superior, pricier speaker from Apple once they have a rival set up. Even the midlevel Amazon and Google devices were discounted to $79 over the holidays.\n\n\"That kind of pricing is great for consumers and bad for Apple,\" said Paul Erickson, a senior analyst with IHS Markit.\n\nSome consumers might consider a $30 speaker to be cheap enough to throw away and not a barrier to buying the Apple device when it arrives.\n\nAmazon declined to comment on Echo devices but said in a press release it sold millions of its Echo Dot speaker during the holiday season, making it the best-selling product over the period on its online store.\n\nGoogle did not disclose sales numbers for the Home Mini, but Google Home spokeswoman Nicol Addison said the company was very happy with holiday performance. Google gave away the devices to buyers of its new Pixel 2 smartphones and offered them for $29 at Wal-Mart, Target and Best Buy.\n\nAmazon dominates the emerging market for smart speakers outside of China, with Google closest behind. Sales of the devices are not yet substantial enough to affect the financial results of either company.\n\nBoth companies took small losses or broke even on sales of the hockey puck-shaped devices, analysts estimated.\n\nThe Echo Dot has about $31 worth of parts, according to analysis by ABI Research.

Libya remains a country in turmoil amid growing doubts about U.S. trustworthiness, says ex-CIA analyst Paul R. Pillar.\n\nBy Paul R. Pillar\n\nThe political inanity about what was said or not said in the first hours and days after the incident in Benghazi that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens continues, and it continues to move farther away from anything of importance to U.S. policy and U.S. interests. With the fixation on minutiae about the editing of some preliminary talking points, it moves farther away even from anything that makes sense in terms of competitive politics.\n\nEven if the Obama administration had wanted to manipulate a public version of the Libyan events to help re-elect the president, how would any manipulation on this matter have done that? When has the Obama administration ever contended that international terrorism is nota major security problem (bin Laden or no bin Laden)? Such a contention would only make it all the harder for the administration to justify and explain those drone strikes and how they have become increasingly frequent under Mr. Obama.\n\nIt appears that preemptive opposition to a possible nominee for secretary of state is now part of what is sustaining the momentum of what began as a tactic in an election campaign. Please let us focus instead on how in terms of attributes and experience this person would or would not be qualified to be secretary of state, rather than how she handled her talking points on talk shows one Sunday.\n\nPerhaps something else that helps to make this supposed issue credible is an underlying assumption that the foreign intervention that helped to overthrow Muammar Gaddafi, and in which the United States participated, was a good thing and left something approaching a stable situation in Libya.\n\nIf that assumption were true, then maybe it would make sense to dwell a bit, when violence nonetheless occurs, on the relative influence of things such as Islamophobic films and the machinations of extremist groups.\n\nBut if instead what was left in Libya is a highly unstable and chronically violent situation in which the plans of terrorist groups, the uncontrolled activities of multiple militias, the inability of governing authorities to secure their own territory, and mass resentment against certain things associated with the United States all get mixed together in a constantly bubbling lethal brew, then any such dwelling is almost pointless.\n\nIt is the latter situation that in fact describes much of Libya, including Benghazi, today. As Kareem Fahim reports in the New York Times, Ambassador Stevens was only one of about three dozen public servants who have been killed in Benghazi alone over the last year and a half. The government is weaker than the militias, and even militias that have been relied upon as ersatz public security forces are unwilling to go after the likes of Ansar al-Shariah, a group accused of involvement in the attack that killed Stevens.\n\nI have discussed before how one of the largest entries on the balance sheet of the intervention to overthrow Gaddafi is the disincentive it created for other regimes who otherwise might have been willing to reach agreements on weapons programs, terrorism, or other important issues but now are less likely to make a deal because they have a vivid demonstration of U.S. untrustworthiness.\n\nOther parts of the balance sheet concern the instability of what was left behind in the country where the intervention occurred. Some in Washington who still believe the intervention in Libya was a good idea are hesitant to intervene in Syria because the United States avoided American casualties in Libya but maybe the same could not be said of an intervention in Syria.\n\nImmediate American casualties are certainly a good reason for hesitation, but not the only reason. Sometimes what appears to be the avoidance of casualties is only the delaying of casualties. Christopher Stevens and the other Americans who died with him represent that.\n\nInstead of all the business about preparation of talking points and demeanor on talk shows, the most important question about events in Libya is: was the intervention there worthwhile, and what are the implications for dealing with problem countries elsewhere in the Middle East?\n\nPaul R.

It can now be reported that the U.S. Military tribunals with the assistance of European INTERPOL have now reconstructed over 5,000 illegal FISA applications reference warrantless wiretapping of American citizens during the period of October of 2001 to January of 2017. This NAZI gestapo-style of warrantless wiretapping of American citizens using the phony the \u2018war on terror\u2019 as a disguise took place under the illegitimate rule of both Nazi junior George W. BushFRAUD (never elected by the American People) and Barack Hussein Obama-SoetoroFRAUD (born in Kenya,never eligible to even run for president). The Nazi junior BushFRAUD spying was directly enabled by his alleged Vice pResident Dick Cheney while the Obama-SoetoroFRAUD spying was enabled by his National Security Advisor Susan Rice, his stooge vice pResident Joseph Biden and U.S. diplomat in Ireland Samantha Powers as well as lesbian Hillary Rodenhurst Clinton, former U.S. Secretary of State \u2018Skull and Bonesman\u2019 and junior George W. BushFRAUD\u2019s 3rd cousin John Kerry Cohen. We can also divulge that the junior BushFRAUD administration and the ObamaFRAUD administration continued to share data illegally gathered on their political opponents with the middlemen being Hillary Clinton advisor Sydney Blumenthal and noted Republican Party Bush Crime Family hack Haley Barber. It can now be revealed that Nazi junior George W. BushFRAUD continued to illegally spy on former U.S. Vice President, year 2000 DULY ELECTED President of the United States of America, Albert Gore Jr. and his family for over six (6) years of junior BushFRAUD\u2019s illegal occupation of the White House. ObamaFRAUD and Hillary made their #1 target as none other than former Democratic Senator of North Carolina John Edwards who was immediately scandalized and politically neutralized soon after ObamaFRAUD began his illegal occupation of the White House.

Word of the NSA\u2019s foul-up is emerging just as Congress has extended for six years the legal authority the agency uses for much of its surveillance work conducted through U.S. internet providers and tech firms. President Donald Trump signed that measure into law Friday. Since 2007, the NSA has been under court orders to preserve data about certain of its surveillance efforts that came under legal attack following disclosures that President George W. Bush ordered warrantless wiretapping of international communications after the 2001 terrorist attacks on the U.S. In addition, the agency has made a series of representations in court over the years about how it is complying with its duties. However, the NSA told U.S. District Court Judge Jeffrey White in a filing on Thursday night and another little-noticed submission last year that the agency did not preserve the content of internet communications intercepted between 2001 and 2007 under the program Bush ordered. To make matters worse, backup tapes that might have mitigated the failure were erased in 2009, 2011 and 2016, the NSA said. By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time. \u201cThe NSA sincerely regrets its failure to prevent the deletion of this data,\u201d NSA\u2019s deputy director of capabilities, identified publicly as \u201cElizabeth B.,\u201d wrote in a declaration filed in October . \u201cNSA senior management is fully aware of this failure, and the Agency is committed to taking swift action to respond to the loss of this data.\u201d In the update Thursday , another NSA official said the data were deleted during a broad, housecleaning effort aimed at making space for incoming information. \u201cThe NSA\u2019s review to date reveals that this [Presidential Surveillance Program] Internet content data was not specifically targeted for deletion,\u201d wrote the official, identified as \u201cDr. Mark O,\u201d \u201cbut rather the PSP Internet content data matched criteria that were broadly used to delete data of a certain type \u2026 in response to mission requirements to free-up space and improve performance of the [redacted] back-up system. The NSA is still investigating how these deletions came about given the preservation obligations extant at the time. The NSA, however, has no reason to believe at this time that PSP Internet content data was specifically targeted for deletion.\u201d An NSA spokesman declined to comment on Friday. Defiance of a court order can result in civil or criminal contempt charges, as well as sanctions against the party responsible. So far, no one involved appears to have asked White to impose any punishment or sanction on the NSA over the newly disclosed episodes, although the details of what happened are still emerging. \u201cIt\u2019s really disappointing,\u201d said David Greene, an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which has been leading the prolonged litigation over the program in federal court in San Francisco. \u201cThe obligation\u2019s been in place for a really long time now. \u2026 We had a major dust-up about it just a few years ago. This is definitely something that should\u2019ve been found sooner.\u201d The last legal showdown over the issue may have actually compounded the NSA\u2019s problems. In May 2014, an NSA official known as \u201cMiriam P.\u201d assured the court that the data were safe.

But more division of Congo and even partitioning may not be the worst outcome, says ex-CIA analyst Paul R. Pillar.\n\nBy Paul R. Pillar\n\nThere\u2019s been more fighting lately in the eastern portion of Congo. Again we are led to think about how a country that occupies such a large part of the map can get pushed around by a much smaller neighbor such as Rwanda.\n\nThis time a rebel group known as M23 and suspected of being backed by both Rwanda and Uganda has scored advances against Congolese government forces and recently seized the provincial capital of Goma.\n\nWhat ought to gain our attention about conflict in this painfully conflict-prone section of Africa, besides any complications regarding access to its mineral resources, is the repeated involvement of multiple nations and the sheer magnitude of some of the bloodshed and human suffering in the area.\n\nThe five years of warfare, ending in 2003, that centered in this same portion of Congo involved the forces of eight countries and a couple of dozen armed groups and led to the deaths of more than five million people, many of them from disease or starvation connected directly to the fighting. That toll made it the deadliest war anywhere since World War II.\n\nNone of this means there is much of anything the United States can or should try to do about the situation in Congo. The complicated and confusing lines of conflict make this area one of the least promising venues for effective outside intervention. (A United Nations force is present; it has mostly been only a spectator as M23 has made its advances.)\n\nTo the extent that bloody events in this part of Africa have had any influence on American policy thinking it has probably not been on balance good. The war of 1998-2003 came on the heels of a shorter war in Congo that in turn was triggered by developments that followed the genocide in Rwanda in 1994.\n\nSubsequent hand-wringing over that latter event has served mainly to inject more emotion than reason into U.S. policy deliberations. An intervention in Libya based on a dubious rationale about preventing a presumed bloodbath was one result.\n\nThe situation in Congo, although it does not imply a particular policy response, may have more general implications about sovereignty, territory, and what makes for a viable nation-state. Maybe Congo is just too big. No one has ever really governed it all, although the autocratic kleptomaniac-strongman Joseph Mobutu came closest.\n\nThe territory that is now Congo was first assembled as an ill-managed private possession of a 19th Century Belgian monarch. The Belgian government later took over the mess and did some good things, but effective governance of a territory that is 75 times the size of Belgium itself was beyond its capacity.\n\nWhen Congo became independent in 1960 it was in turmoil from day one, with a president and prime minister trying to remove each other and the wealthiest province trying to secede. With more than half a century having gone by since independence, there probably is sufficient grounds for calling this experiment in nation-building a failure.\n\nAfricans have since independence generally refrained from challenging the often illogical boundaries that European colonialists had left them, lest this lead to unstoppable unraveling. The secession of the southern portion of Sudan is a recent and conspicuous exception.\n\nThe jury is still very much out on how that story will turn out, and there is not an obvious line of division in Congo that is even as clear as the (nonetheless contested) line in Sudan. But if Congo were to break up that would not necessarily be cause for regret.\n\nPaul R. Pillar, in his 28 years at the Central Intelligence Agency, rose to be one of the agency\u2019s top analysts.

Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman, told reporters that Israel had used a new set of \"tools\" developed since a 2014 war with Hamas in order to destroy the tunnel. He said forces had detected the tunnel months ago and continued to monitor construction efforts by Hamas militants before demolishing it.\n\nIsrael has made neutralizing the tunnel threat a top priority since that war, when Hamas militants on several occasions made their way into Israel. Although they did not manage to reach civilian areas, the infiltrations caught Israel off guard, killing five soldiers in one attack, and terrified the local population.\n\nConricus said a new system involving combat units, military intelligence, logistics and research had been used to destroy the tunnel. The system was first used to detect a tunnel that was destroyed on Oct. 30, but other aspects of the system were used this time around, he said.\n\n\"There seems to be a change, a paradigm here in how these terror tunnels will be able to threaten us in the future,\" he said. \"It is by no means behind us, but this will surely force the terrorist organizations to change techniques and to adapt.\"\n\nHamas, the armed group that controls Gaza, declined to comment.\n\nConricus said the tunnel began in the central Gazan town of Khan Younis and stretched for over a kilometer (half a mile) across the border and into Israel. Although not complete, he said the tunnel was \"very substantial,\" equipped with electricity, communications equipment and a ventilation system. It was located about a kilometer from an Israeli community.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said the tunnels were an unacceptable threat and that Israel would invest \"every resource\" to stop them. \"I hope that in the coming months the threat of tunnels on the residents surrounding Gaza will become a thing of the past,\" he said.\n\nThe army said the timing of the weekend operation was not connected to a flare-up of deadly violence that followed President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. The decision has infuriated the Palestinians, who seek Israel-annexed east Jerusalem as their own capital.\n\nOver the weekend, Israeli airstrikes hit several militant sites in Gaza in response to rocket fire, killing two Hamas militants. On Friday, two protesters were shot dead in skirmishes with Israeli troops along Gaza's border.\n\nHamas' military wing issued a statement earlier Sunday threatening Israel with a \"heavy price.\"\n\n\"Our battle for Jerusalem is going on round the clock, above and under the ground,\" the statement said.\n\nFares Akram in Gaza City, Gaza Strip, contributed reporting.", "domain": "www.newsmax.com", "label": 0, "url": "https://www.newsmax.com/world/middleeast/ml-israel-gaza/2017/12/10/id/830899/"}

The contradiction has pushed Biblical economics out of mainstream debate, says Rev. Howard Bess.\n\nBy the Rev. Howard Bess\n\nThe Bible has an identifiable view of economics. Whether or not we take the point of view seriously is a matter of choice, but for those who give some sort of special authority to the Biblical writings, the viewpoint cannot be ignored. One cannot not say \u201cI believe the Bible\u201d and lightly dismiss the perspective developed by Israelites in an ancient setting.\n\nThe Israelite understanding of economics was developed over a period of nearly 1,000 years, from the Israelite escape from Egyptian slavery to the cruel years of slavery in Babylonia. Putting together the story of their development of economic theory is like following the plot as a well-written novel. In its final form it was laid out by a group of Israelite priests in the Sixth Century BCE.\n\nPriests in ancient Israel were taken seriously. They were not hampered by theories of separation of church and state or keeping religion out of economics and politics. When priests spoke about wealth, property and God, no one would dare tell them to keep their noses out of the public square. They WERE the public square.\n\nThe summary of their economic theories is imbedded in the book of Leviticus in the Old Testament. The essence of Biblical ethics is at times captured in short phrases. Memorize these short phrases and a person has enough guidance for a Godly life.\n\nExamples are \u201cam I my brother\u2019s keeper?,\u201d love mercy, do justice, and walk humbly with God,\u201d and \u201clove your neighbor as yourself.\u201d A controlling and precise statement about economics is found in Leviticus 25:23 \u201cLand shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine; with me you are but aliens and tenants.\u201d\n\nWhen we look at the development of the Israelite nation, it is very clear that they were not a capitalist, consumer-oriented society, whose first order of business was to spend and use material wealth on themselves and to pursue the getting of more so they could spend more lavishly on themselves.\n\nJesus pegged the Israelite tradition correctly when he said the greatest of all commandments was to love God with heart, mind and soul. All ethical behavior and the handling of all wealth were subservient to the command to love God.\n\nThe priests developed not-so-simple rules about how the control of land was to be handed down from generation to generation. The Year of Jubilee was meant to be a once-every-50-years complete redistribution of land among the Israelites. But the redistribution as written in Levitical law was never enacted. I suspect that those who controlled land were a bit reluctant to turn it over to \u201clazy\u201d folk who had not taken good care of the family farm.\n\nYet, whether or not the system was ever implemented is not the point. A principle was set. All people were to have access to and use of the resources of the earth. This basic right was to take priority over any person or group to claim private ownership and use of those resources.\n\nOne can argue that these standards are from an ancient agrarian economic system that cannot be reasonably applied to modern economics. Essentially, that is the view of leading American politicians, whether President Barack Obama or his Republican rival Mitt Romney. They were both more in line with Ayn Rand than the Bible.\n\nHowever, as a Christian who takes the Bible seriously, I am suggesting that there are principles from Leviticus 25:23 and other economic references in the Bible that can be applied to modern economic practices.\n\nThe first principle has already been mentioned but needs to be restated and is foundational to everything else. The resources for the support of life must be available to and enjoyed by all. To cut off people from basic life needs is immoral. It is an affront to the God who claims ownership of all things.\n\nAll possessions are gifts from God, and those gifts are not reserved for a select few. A living wage, clean air to breath, quality health care, and potable water all become demands from the Almighty.\n\nThe second principle is related. I make no suggestion that everyone have exactly the same resources at his/her disposal. However, just as the less fortunate in life must have basic needs met, limitations on accumulation must be put in place.\n\nThe second principle is that Biblical economics limit the permanent control and ownership of wealth by the few. In a modern economic system, Biblical economics demand that such accumulation and control of wealth be brought to an end through taxation, anti-trust laws or other legislative remedies.\n\nJesus was quite blunt. You cannot serve God and money. The arrogance of today\u2019s super-rich makes the point. Super-rich people are in big trouble with God.\n\nThe third principle raises the question \u201cwho is to benefit?\u201d In the Biblical economic system and ethic, the highest concern is focused on right where people live. Economics must serve the smaller of our social units. A social unit may be understood as a family, a clan, a neighborhood or a community. The point of Biblical economics is that the concerns of God will never be found on Wall Street or in the corporate suites of Bank of America.\n\nThe Bible does indeed present an economic system with underlying principles. They are pounding at our door.\n\nThe Rev. Howard Bess is a retired American Baptist minister, who lives in Palmer, Alaska.

President Donald Trump faces a series of deadlines in the coming days about how to proceed with an accord he describes as terrible and too soft on Iran.\n\nWhile the talks involving the White House, the State Department and Congress wouldn't increase restrictions on Iran's nuclear activity, as Trump also wants, they could strengthen the way the U.S. enforces the agreement, perhaps persuading Trump that it's worthwhile for the U.S. to stay in it.\n\n\"The president said he is either going to fix it or cancel it,\" Tillerson told the AP as he sat in front of a fireplace in his State Department office suite. \"We are in the process of trying to deliver on the promise he made to fix it.\"\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview, Tillerson also chastised the European Union for failing to voice support for protesters in Iran. On North Korea, the former Exxon Mobil CEO said rare talks next week between South Korea and the North about the Olympics could offer clues about Pyongyang's willingness to discuss broader issues, including its nuclear weapons.\n\nTrump hasn't made a decision about what he'll do on Iran next week, when he must decide yet again whether to certify Tehran's compliance with the nuclear pact and continue granting its economy relief from years-old U.S. sanctions. In October, Trump declined to certify Iran's compliance, saying the sanctions relief was disproportionate to Iran's concessions and that the agreement wasn't in America's national interests.\n\nNonetheless, Trump waived the sanctions for another three months. And he left the ultimate decision on staying in or quitting the deal for later while urging Congress to change the U.S. law concerning the certification. Trump's aides have said the president loathes having to give a thumbs-up to Iran every three months.\n\nTillerson said the administration was speaking with congressional leaders \"on a very active basis\" about a fix. He suggested Trump might be inclined to preserve the deal by waiving sanctions again on Jan. 12 if there were signs Congress would act in short order.\n\n\"I don't want to suggest we're across the finish line on anything yet,\" Tillerson said.\n\nGetting agreement in Congress on such a short timeline would be extremely challenging. A congressional aide confirmed there has been significant progress in discussions between key lawmakers and the administration, but the aide said negotiations haven't started on a specific text.\n\nRepublican Sen. Bob Corker and Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin, the top lawmakers on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, visited the White House on Thursday to discuss the matter with national security adviser H.R. McMaster, an aide familiar with the meeting said. The aide wasn't authorized to speak publicly on the possible legislation and demanded anonymity.\n\nOne option lawmakers are discussing with the White House is removing the requirement that Trump certify Iranian compliance. Another possibility is changing the law so certification occurs far less often, officials said. Any changes would have to get significant support among Republicans, including many die-hard opponents of the nuclear deal, and some Democrats who largely support it.\n\nIt's unclear if changing the so-called Iran Nuclear Review Act will be enough to prevent Trump from tearing up the \"worst deal ever,\" as he has time and again threatened. Tillerson said the administration's approach has been to first fix the U.S. law that governs how the U.S. adheres to the deal, and then work with European allies that helped broker the accord to address its shortcomings. Those flaws, Trump says, include the fact that key nuclear restrictions on Iran expire after several years, and the lack of restrictions on Iran's ballistic missile testing.\n\nTrump's next Iran deadlines come as his administration is showing support for protesters in Iran demonstrating against government mismanagement, economic problems and corruption. Some individual European countries have joined the U.S. in backing the protesters, but Tillerson lamented a lack of similar support from the 28-nation EU.\n\n\"We're a bit disappointed that the European Union has not taken a more definitive stance in supporting those voices in the country that are calling for reform,\" he said.\n\nTillerson also was cautious about next week's inter-Korean talks, the first such meeting in two years. He said the meeting could be a platform for the North to indicate interest in talks with the U.S.\n\nAlthough next month's Winter Olympics in South Korea are the only item on the agenda, he said North Korea might raise other matters, including its nuclear weapons.\n\n\"Is this the beginning of something? I think it's premature,\" he said. \"We'll see if the North Koreans come with more than just wanting to talk about the Olympics.\"\n\nTillerson, who sat in on Trump's Thursday phone call with South Korea's president, called the Koreas meeting a sign that the U.S.-led campaign to isolate North Korea is working. \"It's an indication the pressure campaign is causing the leadership, the regime in North Korea to begin to think about, 'This can't go on forever,'\" he said.\n\nThe meeting could be a \"vehicle through which they would like to tell us that they would like to have some discussions,\" Tillerson said. \"It could be meaningful, it could be important. It could be a meeting about the Olympics and nothing else happens.\"", "domain": "www.newsmax.com", "label": 0, "url": "https://www.newsmax.com/politics/tillerson-iran/2018/01/05/id/835509/"}

What is it to know that your family will be hustled off to a concentration camp where few if any will emerge alive? How do you prepare for your country coming under the heel of a ruthless killer supported by all the latest technology?\n\nThose were questions faced by leaders in Britain seventy-five years ago. And leaders then included not just political figures, but prominent people in the Church, in the universities (think of C.S. Lewis, JRR Tolkien, and Dorothy Sayers) in business, labor, and the arts.\n\nWinston Churchill had been named Prime Minister on May 10, 1940. Returning in a car from Buckingham Palace, where King George VI had asked him to form a government, Churchill responded to the congratulations of his faithful bodyguard, Walter Thompson of Scotland Yard. \"I only hope it's not too late.\"\n\nEarlier on that same day that Churchill achieved his lifelong ambition, Adolf Hitler's train made a sharp change of direction. Gliding along noiselessly over specially prepared tracks, the train followed the F\u00fchrer's midnight orders. It changed course from a northerly direction to the West. So quiet was the change that few snoring Nazis on the train were even aware.\n\nBut, Hitler was. This day he began his Blitzkrieg on the Western Front. He combined a massive tank assault with air supremacy to crush the armies opposing him. Soon, the King of the Belgians surrendered. His cowardly move exposed the entire French flank. And the Queen of Holland took flight, arriving in England with only her dress and a tin hat. And, irony of ironies: Hitler's long, sleek, black train was named Amerika.\n\nSoon, the outnumbered British Army in France was surrounded. Hitler had only to reach out his paw and he could crush that British Expeditionary Force (BEF) like a little bird.\n\nMany in Britain felt sick with fear. Diarist Harold Nicholson wrote that he and his wife, famed writer Vita Sackville-West, were planning to commit suicide if the Germans invaded. The elites were the best informed and, as historian John Lukacs writes in Five Days in London, the most likely to be dispirited.\n\nWith Norway, Denmark, Holland, and Belgium overrun, and France collapsing, most British common folk did not succumb to fear. They didn't know as much as the elites knew, but they were sure they would \"muddle through.\"\n\nThese commoners even seemed to welcome France's exit from the war. They described the coming Battle of Britain like a football (soccer) game in which they would have the home field advantage.\n\nChurchill was uneasy in the saddle. He knew his Conservative Party did not trust him. They didn't even like him. And his greatest Tory rival, the Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, thought Winston's combative \"fight them on the beaches\" talk was just \"so much rot.\"\n\nHalifax wanted to pursue peace talks through the Italian dictator Mussolini. This self-styled Duce was not yet in the war. Maybe we could go through him to reach Hitler, Halifax said.\n\nIf Hitler agrees that Britain shall remain independent and the British Empire guaranteed, maybe we should at least talk about it. Besides, just having talks would give us a truce and time to evacuate our encircled army from the French beaches at Dunkirk.\n\nFor Churchill, even to talk about a British appeal to Hitler was fatal. As soon as word got out that Britain was crying \"Uncle,\" the fighting spirit of the British people, their powerful Navy, their surrounded Army would pop like a soap bubble. Churchill called it the slippery slope.\n\nAnother thing Halifax wanted: A National Day of Prayer. In this, the man they called the Holy Fox, had the full support of King George VI.\n\nIf appealing to Hitler was the last thing in the world Churchill wanted, a National Day of Prayer was the second to last thing he wanted. (In the popular recent BBC wartime detective series, Foyle's War, the lead character Detective Chief Superintendent Christopher Foyle reacts to the King's appeal for prayer with typically British understated dismissal. His expressive face tells all: \"Their Majesties want us to get down on our knees and pray.\") Americans whose only knowledge of George VI comes from the hit movie, The King's Speech, may be surprised to know that this stammering monarch was a man of deep faith.\n\nChurchill did not have the power to dismiss this idea, too. Perhaps if he gave in to Halifax on NDOP, he could stall the Foreign Secretary on that terrible negotiation idea.\n\nWhich is what happened. When Winston Churchill made one of his infrequent appearances to a church, the Vicar thanked him for coming. \"Prime Minister, I should like to tell my parishioners you are a pillar of the church.\" Ever the ready wit, Churchill rejoined: \"You may tell them I am a buttress of the church; I support it from outside.\"\n\nBut pray they did. And instead of the hoped-for 40,000 or 50,000 troops safely home from Dunkirk, Operation Dynamo resulted in 338,000 British, French, and Belgian troops brought off the beaches. Hundreds of British ships formed a vast unsinkable fleet, composed not only of warships, but of ferry boats, tugboats, excursion vessels, fishing smacks, and private yachts.\n\nAll of this combined to create what even skeptical Prime Minister Churchill would call \"a miracle of deliverance.\"\n\nMany writers looking at those desperate days in May and early June, seventy-five years ago, say that this was Hitler's great lost opportunity.\n\nHe might have destroyed the BEF on the beaches, but he gave a halt order to his army, his Wehrmacht. His panzer tanks stopped in their tracks. Had he just continued on, he might have invaded England and won the war.\n\nNot all British troops were rescued, tragically. To some of those heroes\u2014along with the brave French First Army\u2014goes the everlasting tribute of laying down their lives for their friends.\n\nWhen the Germans demanded the surrender of one surrounded British regiment, their reply was negative and their terse message home was immortal. They hoped to hold out, they said, \"but if not\u2026\" Those words, from the Book of Daniel, spoke volumes.\n\nEveryone evacuated from Dunkirk seemed impressed by one amazing fact: The normally storm-tossed English Channel was \"as smooth as a millpond.\" No one thought they could bring off a third of a million troops because they all knew their home waters.\n\nThe next time some sophisticate dismisses the Power of Prayer, or when TV talking heads sneer at efforts like FRC's \"Call2Fall,\" we can confidently answer them with one word: DUNKIRK.\n\nBob Morrison is a senior fellow for policy studies at the Family Research Council.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/praying-for-deliverance-dunkirk-1940-139882/"}

The government has no answer for this broken economy. We do. God is still on His throne. He is the hope for this nation,\u201d said Ramsey in an online video launch of The Great Recovery plan. \u201cIt\u2019s time for pastors, church leaders, and believers everywhere to rise up together and lead this nation out one family, one church, one community at a time.\u201d\n\nRamsey, 50, told The Christian Post that nearly 20,000 people, including 4,000 church leaders, have signed up to be a part of the movement, which was officially launched last week.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of fear in our country right now. People are fearful about their financial situation and the financial situation in Washington,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cWhen people stop fearing what is going to happen and take control of their situation, only then will our economy begin to recover.\u201d\n\n\u201cWashington cannot fix people\u2019s finances \u2013 people have to fix their finances.

Entitled Jen\u2019s Zesty Honey-Lime Wings they sounded really scrummy.\n\nI took that basic recipe and I pimped it up a notch or two. I added some cayenne for a bit of heat and then I opted to double the sauce ingredients and then pour it over the fried wings and bake them in the oven until they are sticky and scrummily moreishly addictively fingerlickingly glazed to perfection!!\n\nYour family will love you for these!

James Kennedy Legacy Library, a spokesman and cohost of Kennedy Classics.\n\nI see regularly the slogan from the American Humanists Association: \"Good Without God.\" And I think \u2026. well, maybe for a while, one can be good (before men). But only because they piggyback on the Judeo-Christian values they may have imbibed. After a while, it all fades away.\n\nThe reality of that fading away now hits us daily in the news. There's not a week that goes by without some new report of violence and mayhem. Some attacks are worse than others.\n\nJust recently, the UK's Daily Mail referred to \"lawless Paris,\" in an attack on innocent people, including tourists.\n\nTheir sensational headline (6/23/16) highlighted the chaos:\n\n\"Mob violence in lawless Paris: Terrifying video shows 'woman tourist' viciously attacked by marauding youths in city deserted by police despite 'state of emergency' and Euros rampage\n\n\"Young woman viciously beaten 'within sight of Notre Dame' in Paris \u2026\n\n\"Paris is 'like a warzone,' a witness told MailOnline who said he was terrified.\"\n\nAmerica has had more than its share of violence too, even against total strangers. But our founders recognized man's basic sinful nature. That is why they carefully separated power.\n\nThe framers also believed that when the populace recognizes the revelation that has never ceased to be true \u2014 that we will all one day have to give an account for our lives before the Almighty \u2014 people will often modify their behavior. Knowing of that Day of Reckoning and preparing for it, helped prevent a lot of unlawful deeds.\n\nBenjamin Franklin represents almost a secularized version of this understanding that we can't be good without God.\n\nThomas Paine, the infidel, was the only forthrightly anti-Christian leader of the founding era, as far as I know. Paine is best known for his commendable book Common Sense, which helped ignite the American Revolution. Common Sense speaks positively of God and His Word.\n\nBut later Paine wrote Age of Reason, trying to debunk Christianity. He sent a copy of the manuscript to some of the founding fathers. They all regarded it with disdain and displeasure. Franklin, one of the least religious of the founding fathers, rejected it outright.\n\nHe wrote Paine: \"I have read your manuscript with some attention ... the consequence of printing this piece will be a great deal of odium drawn upon yourself, mischief to you, and no benefit to others. He that spits into the wind, spits in his own face.\" In short, this will only hurt you, Paine.\n\nFranklin added, \"[T]hink about how great a portion of mankind consists of weak and ignorant men and women, and of inexperienced, inconsiderate youth of both sexes, who have need of the motives of religion to restrain them from vice, to support their virtue, and retain them in the practice of it till it becomes habitual, which is the great point for its security.\" In short, religion helps promote virtue and restrain vice.\n\nAnd Ben Franklin even noted that Paine himself had probably benefited from his own religious upbringing as a Quaker: \"And perhaps you are indebted to her originally, that is, to your religious education, for the habits of virtue upon which you now justly value yourself.\"\n\nHere's a utilitarian approach to Christianity: It's good for society. Why would you undercut it?\n\nChristians hold that no one is good enough to meet God's holy standards \u2014 except Jesus, who died in the place of sinners to make those who believe in Him righteous before God.\n\nThere's a wonderful video featuring a Harvard Business professor, Clay Christiansen. He says in a 90-second spot that ultimately we must choose between internal versus external restraint.\n\nHe explained to a visiting scholar from China how in America religion benefits society by bolstering morality. We can't hire enough police to restrain evil in our society, but democracy has greatly benefited through the internal restraint religion provides.\n\nAs William Penn, founder of Pennsylvania, once noted, \"If we will not be governed by God, we must be governed by tyrants.\"\n\nEchoing this is an 1849 quote from a Speaker of the House of Representatives by Robert Charles Winthrop, a descendent from John Winthrop, the Puritan founder of Boston.\n\nHe said, \"All societies of men must be governed in some way or other. The less they have of stringent State Government, the more they must have of individual self-government. The less they rely on public law or physical force, the more they must rely on private moral restraint.\"\n\nThen Winthrop summarized his point into an either/or: \"Men, in a word, must necessarily be controlled either by a power within them, or a power without them; either by the word of God, or by the strong arm of man; either by the Bible or by the bayonet.\"\n\nThat is still our choice today.\n\nDr. Jerry Newcombe is a key archivist of the D. James Kennedy Legacy Library and a Christian TV producer. He has also written or co-written 23 books, including The Book That Made America: How the Bible Formed Our Nation and (with D. James Kennedy), What If Jesus Had Never Been Born?

I paused and thought about his excellent question.\n\nAccording to the dictionary the word proselytize means, \u201cConvert or attempt to convert (someone) from one religion, belief, or opinion to another.\u201d And this is exactly what Christians are called to do.\n\nAlthough we may prefer to use less inflammatory terms to describe this process like \u201csharing your faith\u201d, \u201cmaking disciples\u201d or even \u201cevangelism\u201d the concept is still the same. Bible believers are obsessed with converting people from their belief systems to Christianity. If they\u2019re not they should be. Here are 3 reasons why:\n\n1. Jesus told us to.\n\nBefore Jesus ascended into heaven he gave his followers this reminder, \u201cThis is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things. I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.\u201d Luke 24:47-49.\n\nWhen Jesus reminds his disciples that repentance would be preached to all nations he was telling them to convert others from their way of thinking to his. The word repentance (\u201cmetanaeo\u201d in the Greek) means \u201cto change one\u2019s mind.\u201d In Acts 2:38 when Peter called the crowd to repent he was challenging them to change their view completely about who Jesus was and why he came to earth. He was no mere carpenter turned rabbi turned revolutionary. He was Christ (aka \u201cthe Messiah\u201d) and Lord (aka \u201cGod\u201d). As a result of Peter\u2019s proseltytizing efforts there was a mass conversion of 3,000 men on the spot.\n\nRepentance (changing your thinking) is at the core of conversion and proseltyizing (trying to get people to change their way of thinking) is the essence of evangelism. Dress it up, put it in cooler terms but it\u2019s still the same. We want people to set aside their belief systems and embrace Jesus and Jesus alone as the way of salvation.\n\nJesus commands us to proselytize. His last and lasting mandate to \u201cGo and make disciples of all nations\u201d compels us to make it a top priority in our lives. We need to carry out this mission without being jerks but we need to carry it out because Jesus told us to.\n\n2. It\u2019s good news!\n\nIf you discovered the cure to cancer you\u2019d share the good news that you had the cure. If you won the lottery you\u2019d tell all your friends. Why? Because good news needs to be spread! It can\u2019t stay silent. It must be told.\n\nThe word gospel actually means \u201cgood news.\u201d It\u2019s the ultimate good news that Jesus died in our place for our sins and that through simple faith in him we have the gift of eternal life. As Romans 10:14,15 reminds us, \u201cHow, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, \u2018How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!\u2019\u201d\n\nIn this culture when someone had good news to share (like your country winning a war against an invading enemy) runners would be sent throughout the land to proclaim it to everyone. The sweaty, muddy, blistered feet of those running would look beautiful to everyone who heard the good news they were carrying.\n\nChristians have the best news of all. Through Christ we have won the war against an invading enemy. Satan was defeated at the cross and sin has been put to the chase. This is the good news we must bring to the ends of the earth and our blocks. Proseltyizing gives us a pedicure in a way we could never imagine because our feet are carrying good news to everyone we meet.\n\n3. It saves people from hell.\n\nThe Bible makes it clear that those who die without believing the gospel message go to hell. The apostle John put it rather bluntly in John 3:36, \u201cWhoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God\u2019s wrath remains on him.\u201d\n\nSometimes Christians tell me \u201cWell, I\u2019m more into The Great Commandment than The Great Commission. I believe loving our neighbor is central to what Jesus called us to do.\u201d My response to them is this: if we truly love our neighbors we are not going to let them go into eternity without Jesus. We are going to do our very best to save them from hell if we truly love them. Why? Because friends don\u2019t let friends go to hell!\n\nA few years ago I received an email from a pastor about a video that was making its way around the internet. He wrote, \u201cThis is a video of a famous atheist (Penn Gillete from Penn & Teller, the Vegas Magician guys) from a few weeks ago. A guy after a show tells him about Jesus and gives him a Bible, and Penn is very complimentary about the whole deal. His entire point of the vlog is to talk about how good of a man the guy is. Penn the atheist talks in this video about how hateful you must be if you believe in Jesus and don\u2019t tell other people about him. very interesting. great illustration.\u201d\n\nCheck this video out for yourself here.\n\nI love Penn\u2019s line in his vlog \u201chow much do you have to hate someone not to proselytize them?\u201d I love the fact that he, one of the most famous atheists on the planet, is adamant that if he really believed in heaven and hell he would do everything in his power to get people out of hell and into heaven.\n\nIn other words this wildly popular entertainer views evangelism as an act of love, not hate. He sees it for what it is, sincere people doing their best to keep other people from suffering eternal damnation. And he is right. Evangelism at it\u2019s most elemental level is trying to save a person from the flames of hell. It is rescuing them from something, to something, from condemnation to transformation through the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\n\nThose who claim the Name of Christ and who scorn evangelism as an intrusive act of heartless coercion should take a cue from Penn, or, better yet, Jesus Himself. Evangelism at its core is the ultimate act of love. It is seeking to save somebody from the hell they are headed to and the one they are living through.\n\nSo let us proselytize. Let us do so in love. May we never use it as an excuse to be obnoxious, unloving or manipulative. Instead may we speak the truth in love, earnestly pleading with those around us to repent, embrace Jesus alone for their salvation and then start sharing that same good news with others.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/proselytize-3-reasons-why-christians-cant-and-shouldnt-stop-52428/"}

As the tracks progress, Cain switches it up, offering ballads as well as foot-tapping tunes.\n\nThe songs were posted online by Maurice Atkinson, head of the grassroots organization Draft Cain.\n\nEllen Carmichael, the Cain campaign's Communications Director told the Christian Post that the Republican candidate is \u201cpleased that people are enjoying the music and it is something about which he is passionate.\u201d\n\nCain, a cancer survivor, has worked for the U.S. Navy, the Pillsbury company, and as chairman of a Federal Reserve Bank branch. He's also an author and has penned two business-related books.\n\nBook publisher Simon and Schuster revealed on their website last week that they plan to release in October another Cain title: Who Is Herman Cain: My Journey to the White House. The book will be Cain's second political tome, with one published in 2005 titled They Think You're Stupid: Why Democrats Lost Your Vote and What Republicans Must Do to Keep It.\n\nIf the titles are any indication, Cain appears quite convinced that he's the man Americans should turn to. If pre-presidential election polls are any indication, Americans seem to agree.\n\nThe politician, who has a track record of turning around failing businesses, is vying against the likes of former Michigan Gov. Mitt Romney and possibly Texas Gov. Rick Perry for the Republican seat on the 2012 ticket. In a Washington Times/Conservative Leadership Conference straw-poll ballot for presidential nomination picks on July 9, Cain came out on top, scoring 24 percent of the votes while Romney garnered 21 percent and Perry, who has yet to officially join the race, reigned in 17 percent of the votes. The polling occurred at an event in Nevada with about 2,000 conservatives.\n\nThe married father of two also serves as associate pastor at Antioch Baptist Church North. Cain, who was diagnosed with cancer in 2006, has testified on more than one occasion that he credits God with his recovery and survival.\n\nDiscussing faith and family issues on his official campaign website, Cain also expresses his belief that \u201cit was no accident\u201d that \u201cin God we trust\u201d was added to the nation's currency and \u201cunder God\u201d to the U.S. pledge of allegiance.\n\nAccording to the Atlanta Republican, \u201cIt was a collective reaffirmation that we know the ultimate source of our greatness as a nation.\u201d", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/presidential-candidate-cain-releases-internet-gospel-album-52179/"}

However the agency doubts China's communist party will heed the word of caution until the administration can convince it to embrace human rights.\n\nUSCIRF Chair Leonard Leo chided government officials in a Wednesday statement for their response of \"ruthless intolerance\" towards the unregistered Shouwang Church's public prayer services. He also urged Chinese officials to take a more peaceful tact with house church members on Easter Sunday.\n\n\"Beijing's action further alienates the fast-growing number of religious believers in China, particularly during Easter, the most sacred week in Christianity,\" said Leo in a statement.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to Holy Week, authorities from Beijing's Communist Party prevented the 1,000+ Shouwang congregation from occupying the premises it bought to hold services. The church responded by praying outside. The police then arrested over 100 members including Shouwang's senior pastor Jin Tianming last weekend, reported the USCIRF.\n\nNow news site Daily India reports the Shouwang Church are planning to hold outdoor prayers on Easter Sunday unless they are given permission to celebrate indoors at their usual building.\n\nLeo desires the Beijing government to allow Christians to practice their faith uninterrupted. However, Scott Flipse, USCIRF deputy director of policy and research, does not believe the Communist Party will let an event they view to be a form of dissidence go unchallenged.\n\nHe says that the Communist Pary is skittish about any form of public discontent due to rumors of a political uprise dubbed the Jasmine Revolution.\n\nAt least 54 artists, lawyers, writers, activists and intellectuals have already been detained, the Irish Time reports. The most high- profile figure to be detained was the controversial artist Ai Weiwei, according to figures from the Chinese Human Rights Defenders group.\n\nBut in this specific instance, he says, the party feels threatened by the Protestant Church. In some part of China, \"There are more Protestants than party members,\" explains Flipse. \"Protestants have become a political challenge because their growth.\"\n\nThe house church movement now has grown to an estimated 60 million members compared with the 20 million who belong to the official organizations, Daily India reports.\n\nEspecially daunting to the Beijing authorities, he says, is that Christianity as drawn intellectuals, lawyers, professionals and youth to its membership. Flipse told the Christian Post that Communist Party officials are likely fearful that these members are going to be \"more loyal to their church than their party.\"\n\nThese thoughts are motivating party officials to challenges activities to which they previously turned a blind eye.\n\nIn a February 2011 speech, Wang Zu'on, head of China's State Administration for Religious Affairs (SARA), called on government officials to renew efforts to \"guide\" unregistered Protestants to worship in state-sanctioned churches and break up large unregistered churches such as Shouwang into small groups.\n\nThe only way to change China's treatment of the Church, Flipse says, is to show its leaders that it is in its interest as a nation to embrace human rights such as religious freedom and freedom of speech.\n\nWhen asked if President Barack Obama's administration is doing its part to encourage China to embrace human rights, he said, \"I think that the administration has found their voice just recently.\"\n\nIn the past, Flipse said, \"[The administration] have admitted they sought in the beginning to down play human rights to get long-term cooperation.\"\n\nHe said this is not the right path to ensuring China changes its human rights policy. \"Our (USCIRF's) position is clear: You just can't [ignore human rights].\" Instead, he says the United States, and the world, has to send a unified that message that Freedoms of speech and religion are important.\n\nFlipse says he is encouraged by the Obama's mention of human rights during China President Hu Jintao's January visit.\n\nDuring a state arrival ceremony at the White House, Obama stated, \"History shows that societies are more harmonious, nations are more successful, and the world is more just, when the rights and responsibilities of all nations and all people are upheld, including the universal rights of every human being.\"\n\nHowever he says not is the time to do more. Flipse says China will be facing a change in leadership in 2012. \"They're deciding what the policy (on churches) is going to be right now,\" he says.\n\nFlipse advises for future diplomatic discussions, \"You're not going to force China. You have to show them that it's in their best interest [to adopt human rights policies] and why.\"", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/uscirf-urges-china-to-let-christians-worship-undeterred-on-easter-49930/"}

In his book The Smithsonian Book of North American Indians: Before the Coming of the Europeans, Philip Kopper reports:\n\n\u201cThe place was virtually barren of vegetation\u2014no trees and only a few berries and greens in summer, together with indigestible grasses. Fish, shellfish, birds, and sea mammals sustained the people.\u201d\n\nAt the time of first occupation, Anangula appears to have been an island, which means that the first inhabitants would have had to have boats. In his chapter on the prehistory of the Aleutians in the Handbook of North American Indians, Allen McCartney writes:\n\n\u201cThe location on the Bering Sea coast, of course, suggests that Anangula people were marine-oriented, but there is no direct evidence that they possessed boats or the degree of maritime expertise expressed by later Aleuts.\u201d\n\nThe Aleuts had a maritime economy which included hunting sea mammals (sea otters, seals, sea lions, walruses, and whales) and fishing. Of the sea mammals, the Stellar sea lion was most important. Steve Langdon reports:\n\n\u201cThis animal provided not only food but also a vast variety of other products, including boat covers (hide), line and cord (sinew), oil (blubber), tools (bones), fishhooks (teeth), boot soles (flippers), containers (stomach) and materials for garments (esophagus and intestines).\u201d\n\nThe Aleuts are also known for making elegant baskets. In making baskets, the weavers used rye grass growing on the beaches. In his Encyclopedia of Native American Tribes, Carl Waldman writes:\n\n\u201cThe stems of the grass were split with the fingernails to make threads, and some of the threads were dyed in order to make baskets with intricate woven designs.\u201d\n\nToday, Aleut baskets are considered to be among the finest in the world and are sought by both collectors and museums. The Portland Art Museum has a small display of Aleut basketry. According to the display:\n\n\u201cThe Aleut people of Southwest Alaska and the Aleutian Islands also live in a harsh climate characterized by a scarcity of raw materials with which to create art. The many islands, however, are abundant with grass that Aleut weavers use to create flexible baskets made from grass and decorated with wool yarn embroidery or sometimes delicately adorned with downy white feathers from the numerous nesting birds.\u201d\n\nShown below are some of the baskets which are on display.\n\nShown above: Aleut basket made about 1940 from seagrass and wool thread.\n\nShown above: Aleut basket made about 1940 from seagrass and wool thread.\n\nShown above: Aleut basket made about 1900 from seagrass and wool thread.\n\nShown above: Aleut basket made about 1900 from seagrass, wool thread, and cotton thread.\n\nShown above: Aleut basket made about 1940 from seagrass and thread.\n\nShown above: Aleut basket made about 1900 from seagrass and silk thread.\n\nShown above: Aleut basket made about 1900 from seagrass and silk thread.\n\nShown above: Aleut basket made about 1900 from seagrass and silk thread.\n\nIndians 101\n\nMore about Native American baskets from this series:\n\nIndians 101: California Indian Baskets in the Maryhill Museum (Photo Diary)\n\nIndians 101: Arctic Baskets (Photo Diary)\n\nIndians 101: Klikitat Baskets (Photo Diary)\n\nIndians 101: Pomo Indian Baskets (Photo Diary)\n\nIndians 101: Southwestern Baskets in the Maryhill Museum (Photo Diary)\n\nIndians 101: Mission Indian Baskets in the Maryhill Museum (Photo Diary)\n\nIndians 101: Plateau Indian Baskets (Photo Diary)\n\nIndians 101: Mission Indian Baskets (Photo Diary)\n\nIndians 101: Southeastern Indian Baskets (Photo Diary)\n\nIndians 101: Timbisha Shoshone Baskets (Photo Diary)", "domain": "www.dailykos.com", "label": 0, "url": "https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/12/7/1721849/-Indians-101-Aleut-Baskets-Photo-Diary"}

The report seemingly indicates that Breivik, who has admitted to Friday\u2019s Oslo bombing and Utoya Island\u2019s shootings, is preparing to put forward the insanity plea as his defense, although his lawyer has said it is too early to confirm that.\n\nThe death toll from Friday\u2019s massacres in Norway was reduced Monday to 76 dead and dozens injured, as Breivik was charged under terrorism offenses.\n\nFurther offenses may be added to the charges against Breivik, as police declared a charge of \u201cCrimes Against Humanity\u201d are being considered. If convicted on that charge a possible 30-year prison sentence could be imposed.\n\nMeanwhile, Geir Lippestad, the lawyer representing Breivik has told media representatives: \u201cThis whole case indicated that he is insane.\u201d\n\nBreivik has told his lawyer that he is in a war, and that in time people would come to understand his actions and he would be vindicated.\n\nThe confessed killer told a court panel Monday that he was part of an anti-Islamic group that he claims has two cells working in Norway, and numerous others throughout the world.\n\nPolice immediately declared that they would not believe the Breivik had accomplices based upon his testimony alone, but re-assured that they would be investigating the claims.\n\nMonday also saw about a quarter of a million gather on the streets of Oslo in memory of those killed in last week\u2019s atrocities.\n\nThe Christian community has been quick to condemn the attacks. In particular, given that Breivik has been identified in the media as a \u201cright wing Christian fundamentalist,\u201d Christian leaders have been making it clear that authentic Christianity does not espouse such heinous and immoral acts.\n\nAssociate International Director of the World Evangelical Alliance Gordon Showell-Rogers said he was shocked by the events.\n\n\u201cNorway\u2019s strong Christian history has created a long history of peace within her borders and has been a significant contributor to Norway\u2019s very positive impact on global peace efforts,\u201d Showell-Rogers said in a statement on the WEA website. \u201cEvangelical Christians globally condemn religious violence in the strongest possible terms, and are sickened when such violence is carried out in the name of Christ.\u201d\n\nNorways\u2019 Pro Deutschland group said in a statement: \"As Christians and Conservatives, we want to express solidarity with the victims of the attacks of July 22. The hate that is driving Islamic assassins and fanatic individuals a la...Breivik is foreign to Christians and Conservatives.\"\n\nAlthough Breivik may call himself a Christian, Ed Stetzer in a recent blog post calls for caution in the media, saying, \u201c\u2026the facts are simply not there to \u2018announce\u2019 such that at this point. He may well be a \u2018Christian fundamentalist,\u2019 but right now that label may have more to do with some pre-conceived notions, rather than the firm evidence.\u201d\n\nBreivik is accused of orchestrating a massive car bombing in Oslo and going on a shooting spree at nearby Utoya island.

He's a Christian terrorist. He wanted to start a Christian onslaught against the Muslims,\" said Maher on his HBO show \"Real Time.\"\n\nHe went on to say that religion itself was the problem and that Christianity \"is perfectly capable of coming out of its dormant phase and once again becoming the violent blood-lusty religion it was under the crusades.\"\n\n\"They're in just as much denial as the Muslims,\" he argued.\n\nMaher, who calls himself a rationalist, is no stranger to bashing religion, or more specifically religious extremism. His 2008 film \"Religulous\" mocks religion as ignorance, dangerous and bigoted.\n\nOn his show Friday, he pointed to the 13th century Inquisition, the Crusades, the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing carried out by Timothy McVeigh, and most recently the bombing and shooting in Norway that left 77 dead.\n\nInitial reports indicated that Anders Behring Breivik was a fundamentalist Christian. Though Breivik identified himself as Christian on his Facebook page, he said in a 1,500-page manifesto that he is suspected to have written that he did not have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ and God.\n\nConservatives and Christians have been quick to denounce what they feel is a mislabeling of the terror suspect.\n\nFox News Host Bill O'Reilly blasted the liberal media for playing up the Christian angle in the Norway tragedy.\n\n\"No one believing in Jesus commits mass murder. The man might have called himself a Christian on the net, but he is certainly not of that faith,\" O'Reilly said.\n\nBut Maher rejected that statement as he listed past killings carried out in the name of religion.\n\n\"Religion ... gives people license to commit crazy acts,\" he contended.\n\nMargaret Hoover, a Republican strategist who was part of the panel on Maher's show, shot down his argument and the comparison between Breivik and Islamic extremists.\n\n\"He's a nut who calls himself a Christian but he isn't connected to a global terror network that is trying to perpetuate terrorism on everyone else in the name of an organized and well-funded terrorist network,\" Hoover said.\n\nShe added that 50 million people were killed in the 20th century in the name of atheism and communism \u2013 or what she called \"ideology run amok.\"\n\nEliot Spitzer, former governor of New York, agreed, arguing that it's \"fanaticism\" and not religion that is the enemy.\n\n\"Fanaticism in any ideology and lack of tolerance is when you get danger,\" he said.\n\nBreivik, who has anti-Muslim and anti-immigration views, admitted to last Friday's attacks in Oslo and Utoya Island but has denied criminal responsibility, saying they were \"necessary.\"\n\nHis lawyer said he may plead insanity in court.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/norway-shooting-bombing-bill-maher-insists-suspect-is-a-christian-terrorist-53116/"}

He's a Christian terrorist. He wanted to start a Christian onslaught against the Muslims,\" said Maher on his HBO show \"Real Time.\"\n\nHe went on to say that religion itself was the problem and that Christianity \"is perfectly capable of coming out of its dormant phase and once again becoming the violent blood-lusty religion it was under the crusades.\"\n\n\"They're in just as much denial as the Muslims,\" he argued.\n\nMaher, who calls himself a rationalist, is no stranger to bashing religion, or more specifically religious extremism. His 2008 film \"Religulous\" mocks religion as ignorance, dangerous and bigoted.\n\nOn his show Friday, he pointed to the 13th century Inquisition, the Crusades, the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing carried out by Timothy McVeigh, and most recently the bombing and shooting in Norway that left 77 dead.\n\nInitial reports indicated that Anders Behring Breivik was a fundamentalist Christian. Though Breivik identified himself as Christian on his Facebook page, he said in a 1,500-page manifesto that he is suspected to have written that he did not have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ and God.\n\nConservatives and Christians have been quick to denounce what they feel is a mislabeling of the terror suspect.\n\nFox News Host Bill O'Reilly blasted the liberal media for playing up the Christian angle in the Norway tragedy.\n\n\"No one believing in Jesus commits mass murder. The man might have called himself a Christian on the net, but he is certainly not of that faith,\" O'Reilly said.\n\nBut Maher rejected that statement as he listed past killings carried out in the name of religion.\n\n\"Religion ... gives people license to commit crazy acts,\" he contended.\n\nMargaret Hoover, a Republican strategist who was part of the panel on Maher's show, shot down his argument and the comparison between Breivik and Islamic extremists.\n\n\"He's a nut who calls himself a Christian but he isn't connected to a global terror network that is trying to perpetuate terrorism on everyone else in the name of an organized and well-funded terrorist network,\" Hoover said.\n\nShe added that 50 million people were killed in the 20th century in the name of atheism and communism \u2013 or what she called \"ideology run amok.\"\n\nEliot Spitzer, former governor of New York, agreed, arguing that it's \"fanaticism\" and not religion that is the enemy.\n\n\"Fanaticism in any ideology and lack of tolerance is when you get danger,\" he said.\n\nBreivik, who has anti-Muslim and anti-immigration views, admitted to last Friday's attacks in Oslo and Utoya Island but has denied criminal responsibility, saying they were \"necessary.\"\n\nHis lawyer said he may plead insanity in court.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/norway-shooting-bombing-bill-maher-insists-suspect-is-a-christian-terrorist-53116/print.html"}

I want to humble myself before the Lord and say thank you for this opportunity. Thank you for letting me play the game I love. Whether I'm good or bad, whether I'm the hero or the goat, whether I score four touchdowns or throw four interceptions, that will still be the same person, honoring the Lord.\"\n\nTebow also shared about the Bible verses he frequently wore on his eye black until it was banned in 2010. He said he chose Philippians 4:13 because \"there's not a better verse for an athlete.\" It reads, \"I can do all this through him who gives me strength.\"\n\nHe contemplated changing passages \u2013 to John 3:16. \"I told Coach (Urban) Meyer, and he said, 'What?! That's a good point, Tim, but Philippians 4:13 is what got us here.'\" Tebow agreed not to change. But when he finally did during a national championship game against Ohio State, 94 million people did a Google search for John 3:16. \"My first thought was how do 94 million people not know what John 3:16 is?\" he said.\n\nThe verse, he added, presents the essence of what Christianity is. \"It's a verse that changed my life when I was a little boy,\" he said. \"It's the essence of what I believe and that's why I wanted to wear it, because it's an amazing verse that has the power to change people's lives.\"\n\nTebow stressed the primacy of faith in his life. \"You get bashed against the rocks sometimes,\" he was quoted as saying. \"But when you have a relationship with Christ ... One of my favorite quotes is, 'I don't know what my future holds, but I know who holds it.' I know what my rock is. I know who's holding my future. It's easy to get hurried and too busy and distracted from your priorities. Mine are faith, family and football, in that order. When those get jumbled up, you're putting the wrong things first in life.\"\n\nHe also mentioned during his appearance at the Las Vegas megachurch that his teammates would occasionally joke about him not cursing on the field. \"Some of my linemen would come up to me and say, 'What is that thing that stops the water in the middle of the river?' and I said, 'Dam?' and they would laugh and say, 'We got Tim to curse.'\"\n\nCanyon Ridge Christian Church announced it will replay the entire Tim Tebow service in high definition video at the Canyon Ridge's auditorium at 7 p.m. on Wednesday for those who missed it.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/tim-tebow-explains-why-he-tebows-uses-bible-verses-70824/"}

But in Michigan, Muslims are being given special prayer privileges by school administrators, raising questions as about due process, equal protection, and freedom of speech for followers of the faith of America's Founding Fathers.\n\nStirring up the Constitutional storm, once again, is the Council on American-Islamic Relations, Michigan chapter, which has reached a \"negotiated\" settlement with the school board in Dearborn, a suburb of Detroit, which will give Muslim kids so-called \"prayer accommodations\" in Dearborn Public Schools.\n\nCAIR lawyers \"recently met with Dearborn Public Schools Superintendent Brian Whiston to discuss concerns from some parents regarding prayer accommodations in Dearborn Public Schools.\"\n\nConsequently, \"Dearborn Public Schools has implemented a policy which fully accommodates student-led prayer in all the schools, as well as unexcused absences for students who leave early on Fridays for Jumu'ah prayers.\"\n\nThe CAIR-activists are also in discussion with \"Melvindale Public Schools to get similar accommodations for students that are now in place for Dearborn Public Schools.\"\n\nThis policy battle comes just three years after the activists successfully persuaded school administrators in Michigan that Christian literature should be banned from campuses there.\n\nFront Lines of Culture War\n\nMichigan has become one of the front lines in America's culture war. Long considered the cultural capital of Islam in the U.S., Michigan is home to nearly 300,000 Muslims, particularly in Detroit and suburban Dearborn, making it the second largest enclave of Middle Easterners in the West, after Paris.\n\nBut unlike many immigrant generations that came before them, the Michigan Muslims are not assimilating. Rather, they are litigating, and seem to be using the courts, and cowering liberal public officials, to create a privileged place in the U.S., where Sharia law reigns, and the rule of law, as Americans traditionally have known it, does not.\n\nConsider the following:\n\nChristian evangelists were last summer \"stoned,\" according to news reports, at the International Arab International Festival, by Muslims for preaching about Jesus; Police did not stop the stoning, but arrested the Christian preachers. Later, government officials settled a lawsuit by apologizing for their actions, online\n\nOrganizers, however, cancelled the 18th annual Arab International Festival in recent weeks, fearing more violence.\n\nMcDonald's operations in Michigan have been forced to sell Sharia-compliant food via litigation.\n\nMuslim activists stormed the state Capitol in Lansing this week, asking for additional special rights for believers of Islam.\n\nWhat is going on here is nothing less than an assault on the religious liberty of Christians disguised as simple requests for accommodation of Islam.\n\nChristians, simply put, in Dearborn, are second-class citizens, as if they are residents of an Islamic Republic, where they are considered infidels, without full civil rights. Local police departments refuse to allow Christians to distribute Bible-based literature, for fear of infuriating Muslims, but let the local Muslim preachers use the city's own loudspeaker system to announce daily calls to prayer.\n\nThe recent lobbying event in the state capital was organized by the Michigan Muslim Community Council; a co-sponsor is the Council on American-Islamic Relations' Michigan chapter. CAIR-Michigan Executive Director Dawud Walid told the press U.S. Muslims need \"representation\" and it's critical for their voices to be among those heard in Lansing. But what he calls representation looks a lot more like normal people would call \"repression.\"\n\nI have no problem, of course, with Muslims worshipping their own god on their own time. But if the courts are going to prohibit Christians from public worship \u2013 or even evoking Jesus' name at a football game for a high school time, as has been done in the past by meddling judges \u2013 the same standards should be applied to other religions.\n\nAll Americans, regardless of their religion, are entitled to freedom of worship, and, freedom from fear of expressing their spiritual views. This is not what is happening these days in suburban Detroit, and, with the growing Muslim population around the U.S., may be coming to a public square near you very soon. One wonders what Thomas Jefferson -- whose administration battled Muslim pirates on the Barbary Coast -- would have thought about the special status carved out for the religion in modern America.\n\nMr. Koprowski is an Emmy Award Nominated Writer-Producer for FoxNews.com, who has been in the media business since 1984.

But in Michigan, Muslims are being given special prayer privileges by school administrators, raising questions as about due process, equal protection, and freedom of speech for followers of the faith of America's Founding Fathers.\n\nStirring up the Constitutional storm, once again, is the Council on American-Islamic Relations, Michigan chapter, which has reached a \"negotiated\" settlement with the school board in Dearborn, a suburb of Detroit, which will give Muslim kids so-called \"prayer accommodations\" in Dearborn Public Schools.\n\nCAIR lawyers \"recently met with Dearborn Public Schools Superintendent Brian Whiston to discuss concerns from some parents regarding prayer accommodations in Dearborn Public Schools.\"\n\nConsequently, \"Dearborn Public Schools has implemented a policy which fully accommodates student-led prayer in all the schools, as well as unexcused absences for students who leave early on Fridays for Jumu'ah prayers.\"\n\nThe CAIR-activists are also in discussion with \"Melvindale Public Schools to get similar accommodations for students that are now in place for Dearborn Public Schools.\"\n\nThis policy battle comes just three years after the activists successfully persuaded school administrators in Michigan that Christian literature should be banned from campuses there.\n\nFront Lines of Culture War\n\nMichigan has become one of the front lines in America's culture war. Long considered the cultural capital of Islam in the U.S., Michigan is home to nearly 300,000 Muslims, particularly in Detroit and suburban Dearborn, making it the second largest enclave of Middle Easterners in the West, after Paris.\n\nBut unlike many immigrant generations that came before them, the Michigan Muslims are not assimilating. Rather, they are litigating, and seem to be using the courts, and cowering liberal public officials, to create a privileged place in the U.S., where Sharia law reigns, and the rule of law, as Americans traditionally have known it, does not.\n\nConsider the following:\n\nChristian evangelists were last summer \"stoned,\" according to news reports, at the International Arab International Festival, by Muslims for preaching about Jesus; Police did not stop the stoning, but arrested the Christian preachers. Later, government officials settled a lawsuit by apologizing for their actions, online\n\nOrganizers, however, cancelled the 18th annual Arab International Festival in recent weeks, fearing more violence.\n\nMcDonald's operations in Michigan have been forced to sell Sharia-compliant food via litigation.\n\nMuslim activists stormed the state Capitol in Lansing this week, asking for additional special rights for believers of Islam.\n\nWhat is going on here is nothing less than an assault on the religious liberty of Christians disguised as simple requests for accommodation of Islam.\n\nChristians, simply put, in Dearborn, are second-class citizens, as if they are residents of an Islamic Republic, where they are considered infidels, without full civil rights. Local police departments refuse to allow Christians to distribute Bible-based literature, for fear of infuriating Muslims, but let the local Muslim preachers use the city's own loudspeaker system to announce daily calls to prayer.\n\nThe recent lobbying event in the state capital was organized by the Michigan Muslim Community Council; a co-sponsor is the Council on American-Islamic Relations' Michigan chapter. CAIR-Michigan Executive Director Dawud Walid told the press U.S. Muslims need \"representation\" and it's critical for their voices to be among those heard in Lansing. But what he calls representation looks a lot more like normal people would call \"repression.\"\n\nI have no problem, of course, with Muslims worshipping their own god on their own time. But if the courts are going to prohibit Christians from public worship \u2013 or even evoking Jesus' name at a football game for a high school time, as has been done in the past by meddling judges \u2013 the same standards should be applied to other religions.\n\nAll Americans, regardless of their religion, are entitled to freedom of worship, and, freedom from fear of expressing their spiritual views. This is not what is happening these days in suburban Detroit, and, with the growing Muslim population around the U.S., may be coming to a public square near you very soon. One wonders what Thomas Jefferson -- whose administration battled Muslim pirates on the Barbary Coast -- would have thought about the special status carved out for the religion in modern America.\n\nMr. Koprowski is an Emmy Award Nominated Writer-Producer for FoxNews.com, who has been in the media business since 1984.

In this editorial, CP Executive Editor Dr. Richard Land argues that because of the dangers presented to the country and Evangelicals in particular by a Hillary Clinton presidency, Evangelicals should reluctantly vote for Donald Trump. A second editorial, by CP Politics and Opinion Page Editor Dr. Napp Nazworth, argues evangelicals should cast a protest vote instead of supporting Trump.\n\nThis presidential election confronts Christians with a terrible dilemma. Many feel that choosing either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton on Nov. 8 confronts them with an intolerable outcome. Which one is worse?\n\nExpand | Collapse (By CP Cartoonist Rod Anderson)\n\nThey find both major party candidates to be morally compromised and are struggling with the dilemma of how to respond. Scores of them have contacted me personally and asked, \"What should I do? What are you going to do?\"\n\nMy answer is, first, you have a moral obligation to vote. I believe Romans 13 makes it clear that supporting the civil magistrate \"for conscience sake\" includes not only obeying the law and paying your taxes, but voting your values, your beliefs, and your convictions. Your ultimate loyalty must be to Jesus, not any political philosophy or party. Choosing not to vote is disobedient to our Lord's command to be salt and light (Matt. 5:13-16).\n\nChoosing to wash your hands of the whole thing and withdrawing from the process \u2014 what I call the \"Pontius Pilate option\" \u2014 is not a valid or defensible alternative for Christians.\n\nSecond, each person has to prayerfully seek the Lord's guidance as to how they should cast their vote. As with everything else you do, every Christian is morally accountable to the Lord individually for how you cast your ballot \u2014 and the Lord will evaluate both your actions and your motives.\n\nThird, when you cast your ballot, you need to think about what the consequences of your actions will be. Your vote does not just concern you \u2014 it concerns your children, your grandchildren, your neighbors, your town, and your country and its future course. Elections are like forks in the road, and a country, having chosen one direction over another, often finds it difficult, if not impossible, to go back and undo the impact of what has been done. Elections, especially presidential elections, are often written in indelible ink.\n\nBy the way, many millennials I have talked with have said, \"Your generation urged Christians to get involved and make a difference and what real difference has it made?\" Such questions contain a fatal flaw \u2014 comparing the way things are with what they were rather than comparing the way things would have been if millions of Christians had not gone forth as salt and light in the last three decades. Did these Christians accomplish all they desired to do? No, they did not. However, most of them knew that the change America really needed was a Christian revival and awakening, which, alas, has not yet come to our nation. Real American revival will come from a spiritual awakening, not from Washington D.C. Government is a caboose, not a locomotive. When America's heart is spiritually renewed (the locomotive), then, and only then, will the government (the caboose) truly change.\n\nHowever, Christian involvement in the political process has made a significant difference. Without that involvement, for example, President Carter would have had a second term, Ronald Reagan would never have been president, and the Soviet Union (the evil empire) might still be tottering on, systematically abusing the rights and crushing the aspirations of hundreds of millions of people.\n\nNow, to answer the questions \"what am I going to do\" and \"how did I arrive at that course of action?\" I cannot vote for a third party candidate as a protest vote. Why? To me, this is a variation of the \"Pontius Pilate option\" and the consequences of this truly \"fork in the road\" election are too important to merely cast a \"protest\" vote.\n\nSo, how am I going to choose between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton? Let me be as transparent as possible. I know several of the Republican presidential primary candidates personally, and they all were far preferable to Mr. Trump. Out of the 17 Republican primary candidates, Mr. Trump was my 18th choice.\n\nHowever, I cannot vote for Hillary Clinton under any circumstances. Why? First, she is the most pro-abortion presidential candidate ever nominated by a major party. In her husband's Democrat Party, they asserted that abortion should be \"safe, legal and rare.\" As the Washington Examiner observed, now \"Democrats encourage women to be proud of their abortions. The party abandoned the word 'rare' in the 2008 platform, as abortion activists began claiming that the word stigmatized something that was both a benefit to society and a constitutional right.\"\n\nHillary Clinton has evidently never encountered an abortion that she couldn't live with, even though every abortion stops a beating heart. Now, she and her party want to overturn the Hyde Amendment and force every American citizen to pay for the killing of our unborn citizens.\n\nSecond, Mrs. Clinton and her husband are morally and financially corrupt on a scale previously not experienced in American presidential life. They both seem either unwilling, or incapable, of telling the truth. Hillary Clinton's arguments in defense of her email controversy remind me of the explanation an older minister gave me many years ago of \"ministerially speaking.\" He explained, \"If a minister tells you he had 500 in worship last Sunday and he really only had 300, that is not really lying if you know he's lying and he knows that you know that he is lying \u2014 that's 'ministerially speaking.'\" No, it is lying.\n\nThe other alternative, that she doesn't know she is lying, is even more disturbing. It implies a psychological impairment that would be truly frightening in a president. Incredibly, having gotten away with activities that routinely land ordinary people in jail, Hillary is now complaining that there is a \"Hillary Standard\" that is more strict for her than for anyone else. Can we spell the word paranoid?\n\nFurthermore, the financial corruption of the Clintons is a truly lethal threat to American democratic government. The Clinton Foundation is the chief conduit of \"Clinton Corruption, Inc.\" The level of financial corruption, \"pay to play,\" and influence peddling is so massive that it may have the capacity to simply overload our entire federal government to the point that it simply collapses. As Patrick Caddell, President Carter's pollster said earlier this week, the largest criminal enterprise to ever attach itself to the federal government (the Clinton Foundation) took root in the Clinton State Department and now will be transferred to the White House itself if Hillary is elected president.\n\nSo, in a fallen world, faced with the painful choice of choosing between the lesser evil (Donald Trump) vs. the greater evil (Hillary Clinton), I believe I have a moral obligation to vote for the lesser evil. Otherwise, I become morally culpable for the greater evil prevailing. Some Evangelicals have said, \"If I voted for Donald Trump, I would have to apologize to Bill Clinton.\" Frankly, I feel that if I didn't vote for Donald Trump in order to defeat Hillary Clinton, I would have to apologize to Jesus.\n\nWe have all heard \"don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.\" Just so, we should not let the bad be the friend of the worst. In other words, don't let a flawed candidate deter us from opposing the much worse opponent.\n\nAs I see it, in a worst case scenario, Donald Trump is like being told by your doctor that you have cancer in your left leg and it must be amputated or you will die. You lose your leg, have to have a prosthesis, go through painful rehabilitation, and finally learn to walk again. Hillary Clinton is like being told by your doctor that you have stage four cancer and you are going to die and to get your affairs in order.\n\nMr. Trump will in all probability not be a good president, and he will do many things with which I profoundly disagree. However, I fear Hillary Clinton may be a terminal president who will destroy this venerable republic.\n\nConsequently, with sadness of heart, I will cast my vote for Donald Trump and pray that God will have mercy on him and on my beloved country.\n\nAnd I shall pray for you as you wrestle with what God would have you do on Election Day.\n\nAs Christopher Nolan's forthcoming (2017) movie \"Dunkirk\" points out, \"At the point of crisis, at the point of annihilation, survival is victory.\"\n\nDr. Richard Land is president of Southern Evangelical Seminary and executive editor of The Christian Post.", "domain": "www.christianpost.com", "label": 1, "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/the-presidential-election-an-excruciating-choice-168428/"}

Support the troops? Even with support for same-sex marriage reaching historical highs, Republicans still don\u2019t get it: you look like an A-hole when you do something so slimy as to deny same-sex veterans their benefits. Yet, the Senate GOP did just that when they filibustered a bill to finally end discrimination against same-sex veterans.\n\nThe bill, sponsored by New Hampshire Democrat Jeanne Shaheen, only got 53 votes, 7 shy needed to clear the 60 vote hurdle. Eight Republicans sided with every Democrat: Kelly Ayotte (New Hampshire), Shelley Moore Capito (West Virginia), Susan Collins (Maine), Ron Johnson (Wisconsin), Mark Kirk (Illinois), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Jeff Flake (Arizona) and Rob Portman (Ohio).\n\nOf the Republicans who voted for the bill, only four \u2013 Murkowski, Portman, Collins and Kirk \u2013 have publicly expressed support for same-sex marriage. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-California), and Republicans Marco Rubio (Florida), Lindsey Graham (South Carolina), Dean Heller (Nevada), and Jerry Moran (Kansas) did not vote on the measure.\n\nAccording to Huffington Post:\n\nBecause of restrictions in federal law, veterans in same-sex marriages who live in states that don\u2019t honor their marriage receive smaller monthly disability payments and aren\u2019t eligible to qualify for a VA home loan with their spouse. In some cases, these veterans\u2019 spouses and kids are also ineligible for VA medical care.\n\nI guess not every Republican in the Senate is a complete lying, hypocritical jerk. Some Republicans, like Texas Senator John Cornyn, voted against the amendment because he believes the impending Supreme Court ruling will make the bill\u2019s efforts moot. Ayotte, Moore, Capito and Johnson all said their vote was due to the fact the issue has to do with \u201cfairness under the law.\u201d\n\nI guess Republicans like veteran John McCain (Arizona) doesn\u2019t know what it truly means to support the troops. Nor do they know what fairness under the law is. I\u2019m surprised the Senate doesn\u2019t vote to strip away benefits for same-sex couples in Congress.\n\nSo the next time I hear a Republican accuse President Obama, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry or any Democrat in the House and Senate of being against the troops or our veterans, I will happily remind them that it is indeed the Republicans who have turned their backs on veterans.\n\nImage via Gage Skidmore", "domain": "www.addictinginfo.org", "label": 0, "url": "http://www.addictinginfo.org/2015/06/05/senate-denies-benefits-to-same-sex-veterans-showing-how-hypocritical-they-are/"}
